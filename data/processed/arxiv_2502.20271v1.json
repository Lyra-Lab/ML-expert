  "text": "Solving Maker-Breaker Games on 5-uniform\nhypergraphs is PSPACE‑complete\nFinn Koepke (finnkoepke@outlook.com)\nAbstract\nLet (𝑋, ℱ) be a hypergraph. The Maker-Breaker game on (𝑋, ℱ) is a combinatorial game\nbetween two players, Maker and Breaker. Beginning with Maker, the players take turns claiming\nvertices from 𝑋 that have not yet been claimed. Maker wins if she manages to claim all vertices\nof some hyperedge 𝐹∈ℱ. Breaker wins if he claims at least one vertex in every hyperedge.\nM. L. Rahman and Thomas Watson proved in 2021 that, even when only Maker-Breaker games\non 6-uniform hypergraphs are considered, the decision problem of determining which player has\na winning strategy is PSPACE‑complete. They also showed that the problem is NL‑hard when\nconsidering hypergraphs of rank 5.\nIn this paper, we improve the latter result by showing that deciding who wins Maker-Breaker\ngames on 5-uniform hypergraphs is still a PSPACE‑complete problem. We achieve this by\npolynomial transformation from the problem of solving the generalized geography game on\nbipartite digraphs with vertex degrees 3 or less, which is known to be PSPACE‑complete.\n1\nIntroduction\nLet 𝑋 be a finite vertex set and ℱ⊆𝒫(𝑋). Then, (𝑋, ℱ) is a hypergraph and max𝐹∈ℱ|𝐹| is its\nrank. Let 𝑡∈{𝔪, 𝔟}. The Maker-Breaker game (𝑋, ℱ, 𝑡) is a combinatorial game between\ntwo players, Maker and Breaker. In the context of a Maker-Breaker game, we call the elements\nof 𝑋 squares and the elements of ℱ winning combinations.\nThe game is played like this: The players take turns claiming a square from 𝑋 that has not\nyet been claimed. Maker goes first if 𝑡= 𝔪 and Breaker goes first if 𝑡= 𝔟. Maker wins if she\nmanages to claim all squares of some winning combination 𝐹∈ℱ. The game ends with Breaker\nwinning if all squares are claimed and Maker has not won, i.e. Breaker has claimed at least one\nsquare from every 𝐹∈ℱ.\nIf Maker has a winning strategy in the Maker-Breaker game (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔪), we say that (𝑋, ℱ) is\nMaker’s win, otherwise it is Breaker’s win. It is well-known folklore that if a hypergraph has\nmultiple separate connected components, it is Maker’s win if and only if one of the components\nis Maker’s win. Therefore, we will only consider connected hypergraphs.\nLet (𝑋, ℱ) be a hypergraph, 𝑋𝑀, 𝑋𝐵⊆𝑋 two disjoint sets of squares, and 𝑡∈{𝔪, 𝔟}. The\nposition 𝑃= (𝑋, ℱ, 𝑋𝑀, 𝑋𝐵, 𝑡) describes a gameplay state of a Maker-Breaker game on (𝑋, ℱ)\nwhere Maker has claimed the squares in 𝑋𝑀 and Breaker has claimed the squares in 𝑋𝐵. If\n𝑡= 𝔪, it is Maker’s turn in 𝑃. Otherwise, it is Breaker’s turn. In 𝑃, any winning combination\n𝐹∈ℱ with 𝑋𝐵∩𝐹≠∅ is no longer useful to Maker. We call such combinations broken in 𝑃.\n1\n\n\nOne of the most useful qualities of Maker-Breaker games is that positions of larger Maker-\nBreaker games can be reduced to smaller Maker-Breaker games. Given 𝑃= (𝑋, ℱ, 𝑋𝑀, 𝑋𝐵, 𝑡),\nwe can quickly construct a new Maker-Breaker game (𝑋𝑃, ℱ𝑃, 𝑡) that has the same gameplay\nas 𝑃 by letting 𝑋𝑃≔𝑋∖(𝑋𝑀∪𝑋𝐵) and ℱ𝑃≔{𝐹∖𝑋𝑀| 𝐹∈ℱnot broken in 𝑃}. We call\n(𝑋𝑃, ℱ𝑃, 𝑡) the game that 𝑃 reduces to.\nLet (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔟) be a Maker-Breaker game in which it is Breaker’s turn. If ℱ contains a winning\ncombination {𝑝} of size one, we say that in (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔟), Maker is threatening mate in one.\nThis means that Breaker will lose unless he claims 𝑝. Similarly, if ℱ contains two combinations\n{𝑝, 𝑞} and {𝑝, 𝑟} where 𝑝, 𝑞, and 𝑟 are pairwise distinct, we say that in (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔟), Maker is\nthreatening mate in two. Here, Breaker will lose unless he claims 𝑝, 𝑞 or 𝑟.\nExample.\nConsider the Maker-Breaker version of Tic-Tac-Toe. Written formally, it looks like this:\n({1, 2, …, 8, 9}, {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}, {1, 4, 7}, {2, 5, 8}, {3, 6, 9}, {1, 5, 9}, {3, 5, 7}}, 𝔪)\nThe position after Maker claims 1, Breaker responds with 5, and Maker claims 9 reduces to\nthe Maker-Breaker game ({1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}, {{2, 3}, {7, 8}, {4, 7}, {3, 6}}, 𝔟).\nM\n2\n3\n4\nB\n6\n7\n8\nM\nIn that game, Maker is threatening mate in two in two places at the same time: 2, 3, 6 and\n4, 7, 8. Since these two sets of squares are disjoint, Breaker cannot stop both threats.\nLet (𝑋, ℱ) be a hypergraph. A pairing 𝐶 on 𝑋 is a collection of pairwise disjoint two-element\nsubsets of 𝑋. We call the elements of 𝐶 pairs. We define the squares covered by 𝐶 as ⋃𝑐∈𝐶𝑐.\nFor each 𝐹∈ℱ, if there exists a 𝑐∈𝐶 with 𝑐⊆𝐹, we say that 𝐶 blocks 𝐹.\nGiven a pairing 𝐶, we can construct a pairing strategy for Breaker in the Maker-Breaker\ngame (𝑋, ℱ, 𝑡). It goes as follows: Breaker responds to Maker claiming a square 𝑝 in one of two\nways: If a pair {𝑝, 𝑞} ∈𝐶 exists and 𝑞 is unclaimed, claim 𝑞. If that is not the case, he can claim\nany unclaimed square. If 𝑡= 𝔟, Breaker’s first move can also be chosen arbitrarily.\nBy following this strategy, Breaker ensures that Maker cannot ever claim both squares of any\npair 𝑐∈𝐶. This also means that if 𝐶 blocks a winning combination 𝐹, Maker cannot win by\nclaiming all squares in 𝐹. If 𝐶 blocks every winning combination in ℱ, its pairing strategy is a\nwinning strategy for Breaker and we call 𝐶 a complete pairing of (𝑋, ℱ). Any Maker-Breaker\ngame played on a hypergraph that admits a complete pairing is Breaker’s win (see Lemma 6\nin [1]).\nExample.\nLet (𝑋𝑛, ℱ𝑛) ≔({1, 2, …, 𝑛−1, 𝑛}, {{1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4}, …, {𝑛−2, 𝑛−1, 𝑛}}) be a hypergraph.\nThen, 𝐶𝑛≔{{𝑖, 𝑖+ 1} | 𝑖∈𝑋𝑛∖{𝑛}, 𝑖odd} is a complete pairing of (𝑋𝑛, ℱ𝑛) because every\nwinning combination 𝐹∈ℱ𝑛 is of the form {𝑘−1, 𝑘, 𝑘+ 1} for some 𝑘∈𝑋𝑛∖{1, 𝑛}, and\neither {𝑘−1, 𝑘} or {𝑘, 𝑘+ 1} is contained in 𝐶𝑛.\nAs a result, (𝑋𝑛, ℱ𝑛, 𝔪) is Breaker’s win.\n2\n\n\n2\nGeneralized Geography\nThe game Geography is a word game in which two players take turns naming geographical\nplaces. The starting word is fixed. For each place named, its first letter must be the same as\nthe last letter of the previous word. The players may not repeat words. If a player cannot think\nof a valid word, they lose the game.\nExample.\nAlice and Bob agree to play Geography only with the names of countries. They choose the\nstarting word “Luxembourg”. Alice goes first and has to say “Luxembourg”, to which Bob\nanswers “Germany”. Alice must now say “Yemen” as it is the only country starting with a\n“y”. Bob replies with “Norway” and Alice loses the game as she has no valid moves.\nGeography can be generalized to a combinatorial game given by a weakly connected digraph\n𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐴) and a starting vertex 𝑠∈𝑉. The set of vertices corresponds to the set of allowed\nwords, and each edge (𝑣, 𝑤) signifies that 𝑤 starts with the same letter 𝑣 ends in. An instance\n(𝐺, 𝑠) of Generalized Geography is therefore played as follows:\nAlice begins by marking the designated starting vertex 𝑠. Then, starting with Bob, the two\nplayers alternate taking turns marking a previously unmarked vertex. It must be one that has\nan incoming edge from the previously marked vertex. The game ends when a player cannot\nmake a legal move; that player loses the game.\nNotation.\nGiven a digraph (𝑉, 𝐴) and a vertex 𝑣∈𝑉, we let 𝛿+(𝑣) be the set of outgoing edges of 𝑣\nand 𝛿−(𝑣) be the set of incoming edges of 𝑣. Also, we let 𝛿(𝑣) ≔𝛿−(𝑣) ∪𝛿+(𝑣) be the set of\nall edges incident to 𝑣.\nLemma 1.\nThe problem of deciding who wins an instance (𝐺, 𝑠) of Generalized Geography is\nPSPACE‑complete even if we only consider the case where:\n1. 𝐺 is planar and bipartite.\n2. Each vertex 𝑣∈𝑉(𝐺) fulfills |𝛿(𝑣)| ≤3.\n3. Each vertex 𝑣∈𝑉(𝐺) ∖{𝑠} fulfills |𝛿+(𝑣)| ∈{1, 2} and |𝛿−(𝑣)| ∈{1, 2}.\n4. For the starting vertex 𝑠, we have |𝛿+(𝑠)| ∈{1, 2} and |𝛿−(𝑠)| = 0.\nThis lemma was proven in [2] by reduction from the true quantified boolean formula decision\nproblem (TQBF). Even though points 3 and 4 were not explicitly stated, it is easy to verify that\nthe constructed digraph (see Figure 1 in [2]) always has those properties. All these properties,\nbesides planarity, will be very useful when constructing our Maker-Breaker game later.\nCorollary 2.\nThe problem from Lemma 1 remains PSPACE‑complete even if we change point 4 such that\nit requires 𝑠 to have out-degree exactly 1.\nProof.  Let (𝐺, 𝑠) be an instance of Generalized Geography that fulfills the properties in\nLemma 1, but where 𝑠 has out-degree 2. Let (𝑠, 𝑣) and (𝑠, 𝑤) be the two outgoing edges of 𝑠. We\ncan add two new vertices 𝑥1, 𝑥2 and replace the edges (𝑠, 𝑣) and (𝑠, 𝑤) with the edges (𝑠, 𝑥1),\n(𝑥1, 𝑥2), (𝑥2, 𝑣) and (𝑥2, 𝑤). We call this new graph 𝐺+.\n𝑠\n𝑣\n𝑤\n𝑠\n𝑥1\n𝑥2\n𝑣\n𝑤\n3\n\n\nDoing so does not break planarity or 2-colorability. At the start of the game (𝐺+, 𝑠), marking\n𝑠, 𝑥1, and 𝑥2 is forced. The game state after these three vertices are marked in (𝐺+, 𝑠) is\ncompletely identical to the state of the game (𝐺, 𝑠) after 𝑠 is marked.\n□\nWe call an instance (𝐺, 𝑠) of Generalized Geography convertible if it fulfills the requirements\nfrom Lemma 1 and Corollary 2. Given one such instance, a nice consequence of the 2-colorability\nof 𝐺 is that when playing Generalized Geography, the color of the most recently marked vertex\n𝑣 indicates whose turn it currently is.\nBecause 𝐺 is weakly connected, choosing one of two colors for a single vertex yields a unique\n2-coloring of 𝐺. Let 𝑉𝐴⊔𝑉𝐵= 𝑉(𝐺) be the unique 2-coloring of 𝐺 with 𝑠∈𝑉𝐵. As every edge\nruns between vertices of different colors, the color of the most recently marked vertex changes\nevery turn. This means that if the most recently marked vertex 𝑣 has the same color as 𝑠, i.e.\n𝑣∈𝑉𝐵, it is Bob’s turn. If 𝑣∈𝑉𝐴, it is Alice’s turn. Also, if a vertex in 𝑉𝐴 is marked, the player\nmarking that vertex is Bob, and if a vertex in 𝑉𝐵 is marked, it must be marked by Alice.\n3\nConstructing the associated Maker-Breaker game\nLet 𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐴) and 𝑠∈𝑉 such that (𝐺, 𝑠) is a convertible instance of Generalized Geography.\nAgain, let 𝑉𝐴⊔𝑉𝐵= 𝑉 be the bipartition of 𝑉 such that 𝑠∈𝑉𝐵. We can now partition the\nvertices of 𝐺 into six classes:\n• Vertices in 𝑉𝐴 with in-degree 1 and out-degree 2 are in the class 𝑀1,2.\n• Vertices in 𝑉𝐴 with in-degree 2 and out-degree 1 are in the class 𝑀2,1.\n• Vertices in 𝑉𝐵 with in-degree 1 and out-degree 2 are in the class 𝐵1,2.\n• Vertices in 𝑉𝐵 with in-degree 2 and out-degree 1 are in the class 𝐵2,1.\n• Vertices with in-degree 1 and out-degree 1 are in the class 𝑁1,1.\n• The vertex 𝑠∈𝑉𝐵 with in-degree 0 and out-degree 1 is in its own class 𝐵0,1.\nFrom (𝐺, 𝑠), we construct a Maker-Breaker game by first creating a separate hypergraph\n𝐻(𝑣) = (𝑋(𝑣), ℱ(𝑣)) for each vertex 𝑣∈𝑉, Then, for each edge 𝑒= (𝑢, 𝑤) ∈𝐴, we identify a\npair of squares in 𝑋(𝑢) with a pair of squares in 𝑋(𝑤).\nMore specifically, for each 𝑣∈𝑉, let 𝐻(𝑣) = (𝑋(𝑣), ℱ(𝑣)) be a copy of the hypergraph in\nTable 1, column 3 of the row according to the class of 𝑣. Within this hypergraph, for each edge\n𝑒∈𝛿(𝑣), two squares of 𝑋(𝑣) are named 𝑝𝑒 and 𝑞𝑒, respectively. These squares are called input\nsquares of 𝐻(𝑣) if 𝑒∈𝛿−(𝑣) and they are called output squares of 𝐻(𝑣) if 𝑒∈𝛿+(𝑣). Input\nsquares are drawn with a red border in Table 1 and output squares are drawn with a green\nborder. All other squares in 𝑋(𝑣) are called interior squares of 𝐻(𝑣) and are drawn with a\nblue border.\nLet 𝑒= (𝑢, 𝑤) ∈𝐴 be an edge. Then, 𝐻(𝑢) contains 𝑝𝑒 and 𝑞𝑒 as output squares and 𝐻(𝑤)\ncontains 𝑝𝑒 and 𝑞𝑒 as input squares. We understand this pair of squares to be shared between\n𝐻(𝑢) and 𝐻(𝑤), connecting the two hypergraphs. We call 𝑝𝑒 and 𝑞𝑒 the joint squares of 𝑒.\nOn the other hand, interior squares 𝑥∈𝑋(𝑣) of a hypergraph 𝐻(𝑣) are not shared and are\ntherefore not contained in any other 𝑋(𝑤), 𝑤≠𝑣.\nLet 𝑋≔⋃𝑣∈𝑉𝑋(𝑣) and ℱ≔⋃𝑣∈𝑉ℱ(𝑣). Then, (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔪) is the associated Maker-Breaker\ngame to (𝐺, 𝑠).\n4\n\n\nIn Table 1, we describe how each class of vertex is handled during the construction of the\nassociated Maker-Breaker game and during regular play. In column 2, we name the edges in\n𝛿(𝑣). In column 3, we present the hypergraph 𝐻(𝑣). In column 4, we describe the order in which\nsquares are claimed during regular play.\nClass of 𝑣\n𝛿(𝑣) in 𝐺\nThe hypergraph 𝐻(𝑣) = (𝑋(𝑣), ℱ(𝑣))\nRegular play\n𝑣∈𝑀1,2\n𝑎\n𝑏\n𝑐\n𝑝𝑎𝑞𝑎\n𝑥2\n𝑥1\n𝑥3\n𝑥4\n𝑥5\n𝑝𝑏\n𝑝𝑐\n𝑞𝑏\n𝑞𝑐\nIf Maker chooses 𝑏:\n𝑥1 →𝑥2 →𝑝𝑏→𝑥3\n→𝑞𝑏→𝑥5\nIf Maker chooses 𝑐:\n𝑥2 →𝑥1 →𝑝𝑐→𝑥4\n→𝑞𝑐→𝑥5\n𝑣∈𝐵1,2\n𝑎\n𝑏\n𝑐\n𝑞𝑏\n𝑥4\n𝑞𝑐\n𝑝𝑏\n𝑥1\n𝑝𝑐\n𝑥2\n𝑥3\n𝑝𝑎\n𝑞𝑎\nIf Breaker chooses 𝑏:\n𝑥1 →𝑥3 →𝑝𝑏→𝑥2\n→𝑞𝑏→𝑥4\nIf Breaker chooses 𝑐:\n𝑥1 →𝑥2 →𝑝𝑐→𝑥3\n→𝑞𝑐→𝑥4\n𝑣∈𝑀2,1\n𝑎\n𝑏\n𝑐\n𝑝𝑐\n𝑞𝑐\n𝑥2\n𝑥1\n𝑥3\n𝑝𝑎\n𝑝𝑏\n𝑞𝑎\n𝑞𝑏\nIf we enter through 𝑎:\n𝑝𝑐→𝑥1 →𝑞𝑐→𝑥2\nIf we enter through 𝑏:\n𝑞𝑐→𝑥1 →𝑝𝑐→𝑥3\n𝑣∈𝐵2,1\n𝑎\n𝑏\n𝑐\n𝑝𝑐\n𝑞𝑐\n𝑥1\n𝑥2\n𝑝𝑎\n𝑝𝑏\n𝑞𝑎\n𝑞𝑏\nIf we enter through 𝑎:\n𝑝𝑐→𝑥1 →𝑞𝑐→𝑥2\nIf we enter through 𝑏:\n𝑞𝑐→𝑥1 →𝑝𝑐→𝑥2\n𝑣∈𝑁1,1\n𝑏\n𝑎\n𝑞𝑏\n𝑝𝑏\n𝑝𝑎\n𝑞𝑎\n𝑥1\n𝑥2\n𝑝𝑏→𝑥1 →𝑞𝑏→𝑥2\n𝑣∈𝐵0,1\n𝑎\n𝑞𝑎\n𝑝𝑎\n𝑥1\n𝑥2\n𝑝𝑎→𝑥1 →𝑞𝑎→𝑥2\nTable 1: This table describes how we handle each class of vertex (see above). In column 3,\nsquares outlined in red, green, and blue are input squares, output squares and interior squares of\n𝐻(𝑣), respectively. The hyperedge colors have no special meaning and are just for visual clarity.\nFor each 𝑣∈𝑉, we call the pairing {{𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒} | 𝑒∈𝛿(𝑣)} on 𝐻(𝑣) its joint pairing. We\nobserve that, if 𝑣≠𝑠, it is a complete pairing of the hypergraph 𝐻(𝑣). This also means that\n{{𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒} | 𝑒∈𝐴} is a pairing on 𝑋 and it blocks all winning combinations in ℱ∖ℱ(𝑠).\n5\n\n\nNotation.\nLet 𝑃= (𝑋, ℱ, 𝑋𝑀, 𝑋𝐵, 𝑡) be a position of the associated Maker-Breaker and 𝑣∈𝑉. Then,\nwe define 𝑋𝑃(𝑣) ≔𝑋𝑃∩𝑋(𝑣) and ℱ𝑃(𝑣) ≔{𝐹∖𝑋𝑀| 𝐹∈ℱ(𝑣) not broken in 𝑃}. We can\nimagine the hypergraph (𝑋𝑃(𝑣), ℱ𝑃(𝑣)) as (𝑋𝑃, ℱ𝑃) restricted to 𝐻(𝑣).\n4\nRegular Play\nLet (𝐺, 𝑠) be a convertible instance of Generalized Geography, and let (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔪) be its associated\nMaker-Breaker game. Let 𝑉(𝐺) = 𝑉𝐴⊔𝑉𝐵 be the unique bipartition of 𝑉(𝐺) such that 𝑠∈𝑉𝐵.\nFor each vertex class, column 4 of Table 1 shows its regular play sequences. For vertices\nin 𝑀1,2 and 𝐵1,2, there are two sequences because a choice is given to Maker or Breaker,\nrespectively. For vertices in 𝑀2,1 and 𝐵2,1 there are two sequences because there are two possible\nincoming edges. Otherwise, there is only one sequence.\nWe can now formally describe regular play in (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔪). The game begins with 𝑠 being what\nwe call the active vertex. As long as there is an active vertex 𝑣, its class determines what\nhappens next.\nCase 1: 𝑣∈𝑀1,2 ∪𝐵1,2\nIf 𝑣∈𝑀1,2, Maker chooses one of the two lines of play given in Table 1, row 1, column 4. If\n𝑣∈𝐵1,2, Breaker chooses one of the two lines of play given in Table 1, row 2, column 4. Maker\nand Breaker play according to that line of play. Once these moves have been made, Maker will\nhave claimed both joint squares of an outgoing edge 𝑒 of 𝑣. Which edge that is, depends on the\nchosen line of play. The next active vertex is 𝑤, where 𝑒= (𝑣, 𝑤).\nCase 2: 𝑣∈𝑁1,1 ∪𝐵0,1\nMaker and Breaker follow the line of play in column 4 of the corresponding row in Table 1.\nMaker claims both joint squares of the edge (𝑣, 𝑤) leaving 𝑣. The next active vertex is 𝑤.\nCase 3: 𝑣∈𝑀2,1 ∪𝐵2,1\nHere, 𝑣 has two incoming edges, 𝑎 and 𝑏. Let 𝑒∈{𝑎, 𝑏} be the edge that connects the previously\nactive vertex to 𝑣, and let 𝑐= (𝑣, 𝑤) be the outgoing edge of 𝑣.\n• If 𝑣 is active for the first time, depending on whether 𝑒= 𝑎 or 𝑒= 𝑏, Maker and Breaker\nfollow the first or second line of play in Table 1, column 4 of 𝑣’s class. At its end, Maker will\nhave claimed both joint squares of 𝑐. The next active vertex is 𝑤.\n• If 𝑣 was active once already, the class of 𝑣 determines who will end up winning the game. The\nmoment 𝑣 becomes active, it is Maker’s turn and the squares 𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒, 𝑝𝑐, and 𝑞𝑐 are already\nclaimed by Maker. There is a winning combination 𝐹∈ℱ(𝑣) that contains all these squares\nplus an interior square 𝑥. If 𝑣∈𝑀2,1, 𝑥 is unclaimed. In that case, Maker claims 𝑥 and wins\nimmediately. If 𝑣∈𝐵2,1, 𝑥 is already claimed by Breaker. In this case, there ceases to be an\nactive vertex.\nOnce there is no active vertex anymore, regular play entails Maker claiming arbitrary squares\nand Breaker following the winning strategy provided to him via Lemma 3.\nLemma 3.\nIf Maker and Breaker follow regular play in (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔪), and there ceases to be an active vertex\nbecause some 𝑣∈𝐵2,1 became active for a second time, that position is Breaker’s win.\n6\n\n\nTo prove this Lemma, we need to first establish some invariants that hold while there is an\nactive vertex during regular play.\nInvariants of regular play.\nLet 𝑃 be a position that occurs during regular play in (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔪) while there is an active\nvertex 𝑣.\n1. If it is Maker’s turn in 𝑃, she will claim an interior square or an output square of 𝐻(𝑣). If\nit is Breaker’s turn, he will claim an interior square of 𝐻(𝑣).\n2. For each vertex 𝑤 that was never active, and every square 𝑝∈𝑋(𝑤), one of these holds:\n• The square 𝑝 is unclaimed in 𝑃.\n• We have (𝑣, 𝑤) ∈𝐴, 𝑝 is a joint square of that edge, and it is claimed by Maker.\n3. For each vertex 𝑢≠𝑣 that was active previously, if 𝑢∉𝑀2,1, we have ℱ𝑃(𝑢) = ∅. In other\nwords, as a result of regular play, every winning combination 𝐹∈ℱ(𝑢) is broken in 𝑃.\n4. For each vertex 𝑢≠𝑣 that was active previously, if 𝑢∈𝑀2,1, 𝑢 has two incoming edges.\nLet 𝑒′ be the one that does not connect 𝑢 to the vertex that was active immediately before\nit. Then, we have (𝑋𝑃(𝑢), ℱ𝑃(𝑢)) = ({𝑝𝑒′, 𝑞𝑒′, 𝑥}, {{𝑝𝑒′, 𝑞𝑒′, 𝑥}}).\nProof of the invariants.  Invariant 1 can be verified by simply checking each of the regular\nplay sequences in Table 1, column 4. Invariant 2 is a natural consequence of invariant 1.\nThe fact that invariant 3 holds for 𝑢= 𝑠 can be seen simply by checking Table 1. For 𝑢≠𝑠,\nlet 𝑢′ be the vertex that was active immediately before 𝑢. Invariant 2 now tells us that when\n𝑢 became active, the joint squares of (𝑢′, 𝑢) were the only claimed squares in 𝑋(𝑢). Using this\nknowledge, we can use the table to confirm that the invariant 3 holds after each regular play\nsequence in 𝐻(𝑢) with 𝑢∈𝑀1,2 ∪𝐵1,2 ∪𝐵2,1 ∪𝑁1,1.\nInvariant 4 can be proven similarly: While 𝑣∈𝑀2,1 is active for the first time, regular play\nleaves the two input squares 𝑝𝑒′, 𝑞𝑒′ and one interior square 𝑥 of 𝐻(𝑣) unclaimed. There is a\nwinning combination consisting of those three squares and the two output squares. The position\nafter Maker claims the output squares reduces to ({𝑝𝑒′, 𝑞𝑒′, 𝑥}, {{𝑝𝑒′, 𝑞𝑒′, 𝑥}}).\n□\nProof of Lemma 3.  Let 𝑃 be a position that occurs after 𝑣∈𝐵2,1 becomes active for a second\ntime during regular play. We want to show that 𝐶= {{𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒} | 𝑒∈𝐴with {𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒} ⊆𝑋𝑃} is a\ncomplete pairing of (𝑋𝑃, ℱ𝑃). It is obviously a pairing.\nTo show the pairing is complete, consider an arbitrary 𝐹′ ∈ℱ𝑃, and let 𝑢∈𝑉 be a vertex\nsuch that 𝐹′ ∈ℱ𝑃(𝑢). If 𝑢 was active at some point, 𝑢∈𝑀2,1 must hold because otherwise,\nℱ𝑃(𝑢) = ∅ as per invariant 3. But then, invariant 4 gives us that 𝐹′ must have the form\n{𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒, 𝑥} for some edge 𝑒, so 𝐶 blocks 𝐹′.\nIf 𝑢 was never active (which implies 𝑢≠𝑠), we know that (𝑣, 𝑢) ∉𝐴. Otherwise, 𝑢 would have\nbecome active immediately after 𝑣 was active for the first time. Paired with invariant 2, this\nmeans that all squares in 𝑋(𝑢) are unclaimed in 𝑃. Therefore, 𝐶 contains the joint pairing of\n𝐻(𝑢). Since 𝑢≠𝑠, we know 𝐶 blocks 𝐹′.\n□\nTheorem 4.\nIf both players play perfectly while having to follow regular play in (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔪), the outcome\nof that game is a victory for Maker if and only if (𝐺, 𝑠) is Alice’s win.\nProof.  First, we change the rules of Generalized Geography slightly. Marking a vertex more\nthan once is no longer illegal. However, if a player marks an already marked vertex, that player\n7\n\n\nloses the game. This change does not impact whether a given instance of Generalized Geography\nis Alice’s win or Bob’s win; we merely replaced a game loss from having no available legal moves\nwith a game loss from having to mark an already marked vertex. We introduce these revised\nrules to more closely align the gameplay of (𝐺, 𝑠) with regular play in (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔪).\nWe want to show that while there is an active vertex, regular play in (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔪) is essentially\nidentical to the gameplay in (𝐺, 𝑠) under revised rules. Alice is Maker, and Bob is Breaker. A\nvertex being most recently marked in (𝐺, 𝑠) is equivalent to it being active in regular play. The\ngames start out in the same way: 𝑠 must be marked first in (𝐺, 𝑠), and it is the first active\nvertex during regular play.\nIn (𝐺, 𝑠), under revised rules, a player gets to make a choice if and only if it is their turn and the\nmost recently marked vertex has more than one outgoing edge. During regular play of (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔪),\nas long as there is an active vertex 𝑣, a player gets to make a choice if 𝑣∈𝑀1,2 ∪𝐵1,2. These\nare exactly the vertices with more than one outgoing edge. The players who make the choices\nare identical as well: Maker or Alice gets to choose if 𝑣∈𝑉𝐴 and Breaker or Bob gets to choose\nif 𝑣∈𝑉𝐵.\nIn regular play, the winner is determined when a vertex 𝑣 becomes active for a second time. If\n𝑣∈𝑉𝐴, Maker wins by completing a winning combination, and if 𝑣∈𝑉𝐵, Breaker has a winning\npairing strategy as per Lemma 3. In (𝐺, 𝑠), under revised rules, the player who marks 𝑣 for a\nsecond time loses the game. We know from the 2-colorability of 𝐺 and from 𝑠∈𝑉𝐵 that vertices\nin 𝑉𝐴 are always marked by Bob and vertices in 𝑉𝐵 are always marked by Alice. This means\nthat the two games are decided under the same circumstances and with the same winners. If\nAlice wins (𝐺, 𝑠), Maker wins (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔪), and vice versa.\nAll of this combined means that the gameplay in (𝐺, 𝑠) is essentially identical to the gameplay\nduring regular play in its associated Maker-Breaker game.\n□\n5\nIrregular Play\nIn this section, we show that when playing the Maker-Breaker game (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔪) associated with\n(𝐺, 𝑠), as long as there is an active vertex 𝑣, it is not beneficial for either player to violate the\nconstraints set by regular play. Proving this is much easier for Breaker than for Maker.\nLemma 5.\nLet 𝑣∈𝑉(𝐺) and let 𝑃 be a position that occurs during regular play of (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔪) while 𝑣\nis the active vertex and it is Breaker’s turn. Then, if Breaker deviates from regular play, the\nresulting position is Maker’s win.\nProof.  By examining the regular play sequences in Table 1, we notice that unless regular play\nin 𝑃 specifically gives Breaker a choice, in (𝑋𝑃(𝑣), ℱ𝑃(𝑣)), Maker is always threatening mate\nin one. In each of these cases, the move that prevents Maker from winning next turn is also\nthe move that Breaker would make under regular play. This means that deviating from regular\nplay allows Maker to win immediately.\nIn the case where Breaker has a choice, we have 𝑣∈𝐵1,2 and Maker has made one move since 𝑣\nbecame active. Here, ℱ𝑃(𝑣) contains the winning combinations {𝑝𝑏, 𝑥2}, {𝑥2, 𝑥3} and {𝑥3, 𝑝𝑐}.\nThis means that Maker is threatening mate in two in two places. The only way to stop both\nthreats is to claim either 𝑥2 or 𝑥3. These are exactly the two choices Breaker has under regular\nplay, so not following regular play causes the game to be Maker’s win.\n□\n8\n\n\nTo demonstrate that Maker also loses if she decides to deviate from regular play, we will prove\nthat if she does so, Breaker always has a reply creating a position that admits a complete\npairing. We will construct this complete pairing out of smaller ones.\nLet 𝑃= (𝑋, ℱ, 𝑋𝑀, 𝑋𝐵, 𝑡) be a position and 𝑣∈𝑉. Then, a pairing 𝐶(𝑣) on (𝑋𝑃(𝑣), ℱ𝑃(𝑣))\nis called a puzzle piece pairing of (𝑋𝑃(𝑣), ℱ𝑃(𝑣)) if it has these traits:\n1. It is a complete pairing of (𝑋𝑃(𝑣), ℱ𝑃(𝑣)).\n2. For each edge 𝑒∈𝛿(𝑣), if 𝑝𝑒∈𝑋𝑃(𝑣) and 𝑞𝑒∈𝑋𝑃(𝑣), then {𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒} ∈𝐶(𝑣).\n3. For each edge 𝑒∈𝛿+(𝑣), if 𝑝𝑒∉𝑋𝑃(𝑣) or 𝑞𝑒∉𝑋𝑃(𝑣), then 𝐶(𝑣) covers neither 𝑝𝑒 nor 𝑞𝑒.\nLemma 6.\nLet 𝑣∈𝑉∖{𝑠} and 𝑝∈𝑋(𝑣). Let 𝑃= (𝑋, ℱ, 𝑋𝑀, 𝑋𝐵, 𝔪) such that 𝑋𝑀∩𝑋(𝑣) = {𝑝} and\n𝑋𝐵∩𝑋(𝑣) = ∅. Then, there exists a puzzle piece pairing 𝐶(𝑣, 𝑝) of (𝑋𝑃(𝑣), ℱ𝑃(𝑣)).\nProof.  We call the squares in 𝑋(𝑣) by their names in Table 1, column 3.\nCase 1: 𝑝is an interior square of 𝐻(𝑣).\nIf 𝑝 is an interior square, we know that the joint pairing {{𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒} | 𝑒∈𝛿(𝑣)} is a complete\npairing of (𝑋𝑃(𝑣), ℱ𝑃(𝑣)), and it is also a puzzle piece pairing.\nCase 2: 𝑝is an input square of 𝐻(𝑣), belonging to 𝑒′ ∈𝛿−(𝑣).\nLet 𝑞 be the other joint square of 𝑒′. We know that 𝐶∗≔{{𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒} | 𝑒∈𝛿(𝑣) ∖{𝑒′}} should be\na subset of 𝐶(𝑣, 𝑝) to fulfill trait 2 of puzzle piece pairings. If 𝑣∈𝐵1,2 ∪𝐵2,1 ∪𝑀2,1 ∪𝑁1,1, we\nchoose 𝐶(𝑣, 𝑝) = 𝐶∗∪{𝑞, 𝑥1}. If 𝑣∈𝑀1,2, we choose 𝐶(𝑣, 𝑝) = 𝐶∗∪{𝑞, 𝑥1} ∪{𝑥2, 𝑥4}.\nCase 3: 𝑝is an output square of 𝐻(𝑣), belonging to 𝑒′ ∈𝛿+(𝑣).\nAgain, 𝐶∗≔{{𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒} | 𝑒∈𝛿(𝑣) ∖{𝑒′}} should be a subset of 𝐶(𝑣, 𝑝). If 𝑣∈𝐵2,1 ∪𝑀2,1 ∪𝑁1,1,\nthen 𝐶∗ is already a complete pairing of (𝑋𝑃(𝑣), ℱ𝑃(𝑣)). If 𝑣∈𝐵1,2, let 𝐶(𝑣, 𝑝) = 𝐶∗∪{𝑥1, 𝑥4}.\nIf 𝑣∈𝑀1,2, we let 𝐶(𝑣, 𝑝) = 𝐶∗∪{𝑥1, 𝑥5} if 𝑒′ = 𝑏 and 𝐶(𝑣, 𝑝) = 𝐶∗∪{𝑥2, 𝑥5} if 𝑒′ = 𝑐.\nAs we can see, in every case, there is a puzzle piece pairing of (𝑋𝑃(𝑣), ℱ𝑃(𝑣)).\n□\nLemma 7.\nLet 𝑃= (𝑋, ℱ, 𝑋𝑀, 𝑋𝐵, 𝔪) be a position of (𝑋, ℱ). If, for each 𝑣∈𝑉, the hypergraph\n(𝑋𝑃(𝑣), ℱ𝑃(𝑣)) admits a puzzle piece pairing 𝐶(𝑣), then 𝐶≔⋃𝑣∈𝑉𝐶(𝑣) is a complete pairing\nof (𝑋𝑃, ℱ𝑃).\nProof.  To show that 𝐶 is a pairing, we must demonstrate that no square in 𝑋𝑃 is in more\nthan one pair of 𝐶. This is automatically true for all interior squares since they can only occur\nin one of the puzzle piece pairings. Let therefore 𝑝∈𝑋𝑃 be a joint square of an edge (𝑣, 𝑤). If\n𝑝𝑒 and 𝑞𝑒 are both unclaimed in 𝑃, we have {𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒} ∈𝐶(𝑣) and {𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒} ∈𝐶(𝑤). If only 𝑝 is\nunclaimed, then we know that 𝐶(𝑣) does not cover 𝑝. In either case, there is only a single pair\nin 𝐶 that contains 𝑝.\nTo show that 𝐶 is complete, let 𝐹∈ℱ𝑃, and let 𝑢∈𝑉 be the vertex such that 𝐹∈ℱ𝑃(𝑢).\nThen, since puzzle piece pairings are complete, 𝐶(𝑢) blocks 𝐹, so 𝐶 does too.\n□\n9\n\n\nLemma 8.\nLet 𝑣∈𝑉(𝐺) and let 𝑃= (𝑋, ℱ, 𝑋𝑀, 𝑋𝐵, 𝔪) be a position that occurs during regular play\nof (𝑋, ℱ) while 𝑣 is the active vertex and it is Maker’s turn. Then, if Maker deviates from\nregular play, the resulting position is Breaker’s win.\nProof.  Within this proof, we refer to the square(s) that Maker could have played if she\nfollowed regular play in 𝑃 as the regular play square(s).\nLet (𝑋𝑃, ℱ𝑃) be the game 𝑃 reduces to and let 𝑝∈𝑋𝑃 be any square besides the regular\nplay square(s). We want to show that there exists a reply 𝑞∈𝑋𝑃∖{𝑝} such that the resulting\nposition 𝑃′ ≔(𝑋, ℱ, 𝑋𝑀∪{𝑝}, 𝑋𝐵∪{𝑞}, 𝔪) admits a complete pairing 𝐶.\nClass of 𝑣\nSince 𝑣 became active, Maker has claimed…\n…no squares.\n…one square.\n…two squares.\n𝑣∈𝑀1,2\n⋆\n𝑣∈𝐵1,2\n⋆⋆\n⋆⋆\n𝑣∈𝑀2,1\n𝑣∈𝐵2,1\n𝑣∈𝑁1,1 ∪𝐵0,1\nTable 2:  The possibilities for what (𝑋𝑃(𝑣), ℱ𝑃(𝑣)) can look like. Input squares, output squares,\nand interior squares are red, green, and blue, respectively. The regular play squares are denoted\nby a circle shape instead of a square shape.\nThe choice of 𝑞 depends on which of these 10 forms the hypergraph (𝑋𝑃(𝑣), ℱ𝑃(𝑣)) takes.\n• If (𝑋𝑃(𝑣), ℱ𝑃(𝑣)) takes any form besides those marked with a ⋆ or ⋆⋆ in the bottom right\ncorner of the cell, we always let 𝑞 be the regular play square.\n• If (𝑋𝑃(𝑣), ℱ𝑃(𝑣)) takes the form marked with ⋆, we similarly let 𝑞 be one of the two regular\nplay squares. If 𝑝 shares a winning combination with one of them but not the other, we\nchoose 𝑞 as the regular play square that does share a winning combination with 𝑝. Otherwise,\nboth options for 𝑞 are equally viable.\n• If (𝑋𝑃(𝑣), ℱ𝑃(𝑣)) takes one of the forms marked with ⋆⋆ (implying 𝑣∈𝐵1,2), let 𝑒′ be the\noutgoing edge where {𝑝𝑒′, 𝑞𝑒′} does not contain the regular play square. Here, it might be\nthat case that Maker tried to subvert Breaker’s decision by claiming a joint square of\n𝑒′, i.e. 𝑝∈{𝑝𝑒′, 𝑞𝑒′}. In that case, we let 𝑞 be the interior square of 𝐻(𝑣) that is unclaimed in\n𝑃 and shares a winning combination with 𝑝𝑒′ and 𝑞𝑒′ (in Table 1, column 2 it is called 𝑥4).\nIf 𝑝∉{𝑝𝑒′, 𝑞𝑒′}, we simply let 𝑞 be the regular play square.\n10\n\n\nLet (𝑋𝑃′, ℱ𝑃′) be the game that 𝑃′ reduces to. To show that a complete pairing 𝐶 of\n(𝑋𝑃′, ℱ𝑃′) exists, we will use Lemma 7. This means that we try to find puzzle piece pairings\nof (𝑋𝑃′(𝑤), ℱ𝑃′(𝑤)) for each 𝑤∈𝑉. There are five categories that 𝑤 can fall into.\nCategory 1: 𝑤has been active before 𝑣was, and 𝑤∉𝑀2,1.\nWe know from invariant 3 for regular play that ℱ𝑃(𝑤) = ∅. It follows that ℱ𝑃′(𝑤) = ∅, so\n{{𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒} | 𝑒∈𝛿(𝑣) with 𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒∈𝑋𝑃′} is a puzzle piece pairing of (𝑋𝑃′(𝑤), ℱ𝑃′(𝑤)).\nCategory 2: 𝑤has been active before 𝑣was, and 𝑤∈𝑀2,1.\nWe know from invariant 4 for regular play that (𝑋𝑃(𝑤), ℱ𝑃(𝑤)) takes the form\n({𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒, 𝑥}, {{𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒, 𝑥}}) for some edge 𝑒∈𝛿−(𝑤) and some interior square 𝑥 of 𝐻(𝑤). If\n𝑞∈{𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒}, then ∅ is a puzzle piece pairing of (𝑋𝑃′(𝑤), ℱ𝑃′(𝑤)). If 𝑝 is one of these three\nsquares and 𝑞 is not, then {𝑋𝑃(𝑤) ∖{𝑝}} is a puzzle piece pairing of (𝑋𝑃′(𝑤), ℱ𝑃′(𝑤)).\nCategory 3: 𝑤was never active and 𝑋𝑃(𝑤) = 𝑋(𝑤).\nIf 𝑝∈𝑋𝑃(𝑤), we know from Lemma  6 that a puzzle piece pairing 𝐶(𝑤, 𝑝) exists in\n(𝑋𝑃′(𝑤), ℱ𝑃′(𝑤)). Otherwise, the joint pairing of 𝐻(𝑤) is a puzzle piece pairing of\n(𝑋𝑃′(𝑤), ℱ𝑃′(𝑤)) after removing all pairs that contain 𝑞.\nCategory 4: 𝑤was never active, but 𝑋𝑃(𝑤) ≠𝑋(𝑤).\nThen, we know from invariant 2 for regular play that 𝑒= (𝑣, 𝑤) ∈𝐴 and 𝑋𝑃(𝑤) = 𝑋(𝑤) ∖{𝑥}\nfor some 𝑥∈{𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒}. If Maker tried to subvert Breaker’s decision, since 𝑥 is already claimed,\nwe must be in the rightmost column of Table 2. We know that 𝑝, 𝑞∉𝑋(𝑤). Then, Lemma 6\ntells us that a puzzle piece pairing 𝐶(𝑤, 𝑥) exists in (𝑋𝑃′(𝑤), ℱ𝑃′(𝑤)).\nIf not, we chose 𝑞 to be the regular play square, which is the joint square of 𝑒 that is not 𝑥. If\n𝑝∉𝑋(𝑤), we remove the pair {𝑥, 𝑞} from the joint pairing of 𝐻(𝑤). If 𝑝∈𝑋(𝑤), we remove\n{𝑥, 𝑞} from 𝐶(𝑤, 𝑝) as provided by Lemma 6. Either way, we obtain a puzzle piece pairing\nof (𝑋𝑃′(𝑤), ℱ𝑃′(𝑤)).\nCategory 5: 𝑤= 𝑣.\nIf (𝑋𝑃(𝑣), ℱ𝑃(𝑣)) takes a form besides the ones marked with ⋆ or ⋆⋆, ℱ𝑃′(𝑣) is either empty or\ncontains one winning combination. That winning combination contains three or four squares,\ndepending on 𝑝. Here, we can find a puzzle piece pairing of (𝑋𝑃′(𝑣), ℱ𝑃′(𝑣)) similarly to how\nwe did in category 2.\nIf (𝑋𝑃(𝑣), ℱ𝑃(𝑣)) takes the form marked with ⋆, let 𝑞′ ≠𝑞 be the regular play square we didn’t\nchoose for 𝑞. Then, 𝑋𝑃(𝑣) contains three squares that share a winning combination with 𝑞′ but\nnot 𝑞, and therefore must be unclaimed: An interior square 𝑥 and two joint squares 𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒 of some\nedge 𝑒∈𝛿+(𝑣). Therefore, we have 𝑋𝑃′(𝑣) ⊇{𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒, 𝑥, 𝑞′}. Looking at the remaining winning\ncombinations, we see that {{𝑝𝑒, 𝑞𝑒}, {𝑥, 𝑞′}} is a puzzle piece pairing of (𝑋𝑃′(𝑣), ℱ𝑃′(𝑣)).\nIf (𝑋𝑃(𝑣), ℱ𝑃(𝑣)) takes one of the two forms marked with ⋆⋆ and Maker did not try to subvert\nBreaker’s decision, we have 𝑋𝑃′(𝑣) ⊇{𝑝𝑒′, 𝑞𝑒′} and ℱ𝑃′(𝑣) = {{𝑝𝑒′, 𝑞𝑒′}} for some 𝑒′ ∈𝛿+(𝑣).\nHere, {𝑝𝑒′, 𝑞𝑒′} is a puzzle piece pairing of that hypergraph.\nIf Maker did try to subvert Breaker’s decision, ℱ𝑃′(𝑣) is either empty (if we are in the rightmost\ncolumn of Table 2) or, if we are in the middle column, it contains a winning combination of\nthe form {𝑥, 𝑝𝑒}, where 𝑥 is the interior square that is not 𝑞 and 𝑒 is the outgoing edge that\ncontains the regular play square. Only in this case does (𝑋𝑃′(𝑣), ℱ𝑃′(𝑣)) not admit a puzzle\npiece pairing, but it does admit the complete pairing {{𝑥, 𝑝𝑒}}.\n11\n\n\nAs we have seen, a puzzle piece pairing of (𝑋𝑃′(𝑤), ℱ𝑃′(𝑤)) always exists for 𝑤≠𝑣, and it\nexists for 𝑤= 𝑣 in all cases but one. Unless we are in that case, the existence of a complete\npairing of (𝑋𝑃′, ℱ𝑃′) follows immediately from Lemma 7.\nIf we are in that case, we construct our complete pairing as follows: Let 𝑒= (𝑣, 𝑤′) be the edge\nfor which 𝑝𝑒 is the regular play square. For all 𝑤∉{𝑣, 𝑤′}, let 𝐶(𝑤) be the puzzle piece pairing\ngiven above. For the vertex 𝑤′, we know that it falls in category 1, 2, or 3, and 𝑝∉𝑋(𝑤′). If it\nfalls into category 1, let 𝐶(𝑤′) = ∅. If it falls into category 2, let 𝐶(𝑤′) = {{𝑞𝑒, 𝑥′}}, where 𝑥′\nis the one interior square in 𝑋𝑃′(𝑤′). If it falls into category 3, let 𝐶(𝑤′) be the puzzle piece\npairing 𝐶(𝑤′, 𝑝𝑒) obtained from Lemma 6. Finally, let 𝐶(𝑣) = {{𝑝𝑒, 𝑥}}, where 𝑥 is the one\ninterior square of 𝑋𝑃′(𝑣). Then, ⋃𝑤∈𝑉𝐶(𝑤) is a complete pairing of (𝑋𝑃′, ℱ𝑃′).\n□\n6\nPSPACE‑completeness\nWe can now put the pieces together and prove the result we have been working towards.\nTheorem 9.\nDetermining the winner of a Maker-Breaker game is a PSPACE‑complete decision problem\neven if we only allow games played on hypergraphs of rank 5.\nProof.  Let (𝐺, 𝑠) be a convertible instance of Generalized Geography, and (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔪) its\nassociated Maker-Breaker game. Combining Lemma 5 with Lemma 8 yields that one way for\nMaker and Breaker to play perfectly in (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔪) is to follow regular play. As a result, (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔪)\nis Maker’s win if and only if it is also Maker’s win when only perfect play is allowed. Adding\nTheorem 4, we obtain the result that (𝐺, 𝑠) is Alice’s win if and only if (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔪) is Maker’s win.\nSince (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔪) can be constructed in linear time with respect to the size of 𝐺, we obtain\na polynomial transformation from the problem of solving convertible instances of generalized\ngeography to the problem of solving rank-5 Maker-Breaker games. Given Corollary 2, this means\nthat the latter problem is PSPACE‑hard.\nSolving general Maker-Breaker games is a problem in PSPACE [3]. Hence, solving rank-5\nMaker-Breaker games is a PSPACE‑complete problem.\n□\nCorollary 10.\nDetermining the winner of a Maker-Breaker game is a PSPACE‑complete decision problem\neven if we only allow games played on 5-uniform hypergraphs.\nProof.  Let (𝐺, 𝑠) be a convertible instance of Generalized Geography, and (𝑋, ℱ, 𝔪) its\nassociated Maker-Breaker game. In the proof of Corollary 17 in [4], it was demonstrated how\na hyperedge 𝐹∈ℱ of size 𝑛 can be replaced by two hyperedges 𝐹1, 𝐹2 of size 𝑛+ 1 without\nchanging the winner of the Maker-Breaker game. We can use that method until all hyperedges\nhave exactly size 5. The amount of edges we add scales only linearly with the size of 𝑉(𝐺), so\nthe time complexity of constructing the associated Maker-Breaker game remains the same. □\n12\n\n\n7\nConclusion\nBy polynomial transformation from the problem of determining the winner of a special case of\nGeneralized Geography, we could show that the problem of solving Maker-Breaker games on\n5-uniform hypergraphs is also PSPACE‑complete.\nIn [5], it was shown that the problem of solving Maker-Breaker games on hypergraphs of rank\n3 or lower can be solved in polynomial time. This leaves us with an obvious open problem: How\ndifficult is solving Maker-Breaker games on hypergraphs of rank 4?\nAcknowledgements\nA version of this result began to take shape while I wrote my master’s thesis.
