To check the eﬀect of the nonlinearity\nwe apply the translations and special conformal transformations (SCTs) to Dirac spinors in certain\ninteractions. These two transformations do not lead to nonlinear terms in Yukawa term, but do in\nvector-spinor interaction. And the nonlinear terms would deﬁnitely cause CP violation.\nI.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe study of conformal group in physics has been\nupdating ever since Bateman and Cunningham discov-\nered [1, 2] that Maxwell’s equations are invariant under\nconformal transformations in 1910. The conformal group\nis composed of conformal transformations with Poincar´e\ngroup as its subgroup.\nAdditional to translations and\nrotations, the conformal group includes dilations and\nspecial conformal transformations (SCTs). The dilation,\nalso known as scaling transformation, is widely used\nin diﬀerent renormalization schemes [3]. The inversion\nis also a conformal transformation, but it is somehow\nequivalent to the SCT which is constructed through\nthe combination of a inversion, a translation, and a\nsecond inversion.\nThe properties of the SCT are\nparticularly distinctive, as they can be locally viewed\nas the combination of a rotation and dilation with\ncoordinate-dependent coeﬃcients, which illustrates the\nnonlinear nature of the SCT. So far, it remains elusive for\nus that how the nonlinearity manifests itself in diﬀerent\nrepresentations of conformal group, for instance in spinor\nrepresentations.\nIt is well known that few actions and equations\nmaintain conformal invariance due to the nonlinear\nnature of the SCT, for instance, the acceleration equation\nin special relativity [4, 5] and the action of the photon\nﬁeld [6]. The nonlinear properties of the SCT have been\nstudied in previous literatures [7, 8], where it seems\ntransforming the trajectory of a particle moving in a\nstraight line into two particles moving along a hyperbola.\nAnother work concerns conformal transformations in\nthe four-dimensional electrodynamics [9], where the two\nparticles moving along the hyperbola are interpreted by\nthe Born solutions when the selected electric ﬁeld is\nCoulomb ﬁeld.\nRecently, in the conformal bootstrap\nmethod [10, 11], the nonlinearity of the SCT has been\n∗wangzp@nenu.edu.cn\n† hjwang@jlu.edu.cn\nmanifested by the ﬁnite transformations of “primary\noperator”, leading to the determination of the critical\nexponent of the three-dimensional Ising model [12].\nEven more, the conformal group has been schematically\napplied to conformal quantum mechanics, chaos and\ncosmology [13–16], where the conformal group is reduced\nto the SL(2,R) group.\nUp to date, the conformal transformations for scalar\nand vector have been extensively studied. Whereas the\nstudy for spinor [17–19] remain not adequate, for instance\nhow to apply them to Dirac spinors. Consequently, two\nissues arise while regarding the four-dimensional SCT.\nThe ﬁrst issue concerns the nonlinear eﬀects of the SCT\nin diﬀerent representations which have not been explicitly\ncompared.\nThe second issue relates to the derivation\nof spinor representations of the conformal group [17],\ni.e.\nhow to connect the spinor representation with\nfour-dimensional spacetime transformations Eqs.\n(1).\nThis connection should not be confused with progress\nin deriving the four-dimensional conformal group via\nsix-dimensional “isotropic-vector” [20–22] (the vector\ncomponents meet x2\n1 + x2\n2 + x2\n3 + x2\n4 + x2\n5 + x2\n6 = 0). In\nthat case, spinor representations of the four-dimensional\nconformal group can also be derived.\nHowever, the\ncoordinate transformations in six dimensions are not\nidentical to those Eqs. (1) in four dimensions.\nIn two dimensions, conformal transformations can\nbe associated to linear fractional transformations (pro-\njective transformations, Mobius transformations) [23].\nTherefore to address the two issues mentioned above,\nwe extend linear fractional transformations from two\ndimensions to four dimensions,\nusing biquaternions\n[24] to replace complex numbers.\nIn a recent work\n[25], hyperquaternions were employed to derive the\nsix-dimensional coordinate transformations and four-\ndimensional generators of the conformal group. Whereas\nto explicitly manifest the connection between four-\ndimensional spacetime transformations and the spinor\nrepresentations, biquaternions prove to be convenient\n[26]. Our results show that both translations and SCTs\nhave nonlinear eﬀects while acting on the vector-spinor\ninteraction, however while they acting on the Yukawa\n\n\n2\nterm, the nonlinearity vanishes. At the early moments\nof universe, the acceleration should be expressed in a\ntransformation manner merely by translations and SCTs,\nwhich we deﬁne in this paper as the physical translations.\nSuch physical translations would cause somehow the\nviolation of charge conjugation parity (CP).\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows.\nIn Sec.\nII, we present the basic deﬁnition of the\nconformal transformation. In Sec. III, we associate the\ncoordinate transformation with the spinor representation\nof the conformal group via generalized linear fractional\ntransformations.\nIn Sec.\nIV, we apply conformal\ntransformations to Dirac spinors. In Sec. V, we discuss\nour results.\nII.\nTHE BASIS OF CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\nIn this section, we introduce conformal transforma-\ntions, with a particular focus on the properties of\nSCTs.\nIn Minkowski space with the metric gµν\n=\ndiag(1, −1, −1, −1), ﬁnite conformal transformations are\ndeﬁned to be\n(translation) xµ′ = xµ + aµ,\n(1a)\n(rotation) xµ′ = Λµ\nνxν,\n(1b)\n(dilation) xµ′ = eαxν,\n(1c)\n(SCT) xµ′ =\nxµ −bµx2\n(1 −2b · x + b2x2),\n(1d)\namong which the SCT consists of a series of transforma-\ntions,\nxµ′ =xµ\nx2 ,\n(2a)\nxµ′′ =xµ\nx2 −bµ,\n(2b)\nxµ′′′ =\nxµ\nx2 −bµ\n( xν\nx2 −bν)( xν\nx2 −bν),\n(2c)\nwhere Eq.\n(2a) is deﬁned as inversion, Eqs.\n(2b)\nand (2c) are known as translation and second inversion.\nObviously, inversions are the most important operations\nfor ﬁnite conformal transformations.\nHowever while\nconstructing\ninﬁnitesimal conformal transformations,\ninversions are replaced by SCTs. Unlike translation, ro-\ntation, and dilation, SCTs are nonlinear transformations.\nThe generators of the conformal group can be derived\nthrough inﬁnitesimal transformations. The explicit forms\nof these generators are\nPµ = −i∂µ,\n(3a)\nMµν = −i(xν∂µ −xµ∂ν),\n(3b)\nD = −ixµ∂µ,\n(3c)\nKµ = −i(2xµxν∂ν −x2∂µ),\n(3d)\nwhere, Pµ, Mµν, D, and Kµ are respectively generators\nof translations, rotations , dilations, and SCTs. A SCT\nlocally looks like the combination of a dilation Ω(x) and\na rotation Rµ\nν(x), which is shown by the Jacobian of the\nSCT [27]\n∂xµ′\n∂xν = Ω(x)Rµ\nν(x),\n(4)\nwhere Ω(x) and Rµ\nν(x) are\nΩ(x) =(1 −2b · x + b2x2)−1,\nRµ\nν(x) =δµ\nν + Ω(x)[2(bνxµ −bµxν) + 4b · xbµxν\n−2(bµbνx2 + b2xµxν)].\n(5)\nAccording to Eq.\n(5), we observe that the powers of\ntranslation parameter (coeﬃcient) bµ and coordinate xµ\nare the same. Thus, in the spinor representation, we shall\nregard the power of bµ as the degree of nonlinearity of the\nconformal transformations, more details as following Eq.\n(63) .\nIII.\nREDERIVE THE SPINOR REPRESENTATION OF\nCONFORMAL GROUP\nIn this section, we will generalize the linear fractional\ntransformation Λ =\n\u0012\na b\nc d\n\u0013\n, by using biquaternions in\nplace of complex numbers (Here the letters a, b, c, d have\nnothing to do with those in last section, we don’t stress\nthat henceforth unless confusion appears.).\nBy such\ngeneralization we extend the conformal transformations\nfrom two-dimensions to four-dimensions, meanwhile we\nobtain the mapping between spacetime transformations\nand spinor representations of the conformal group.\nA.\nSpinor Representation in two dimension\nNow we introduce the linear fractional transformation\nby which conformal transformations can be associated\nwith matrices.\nAnd using these matrices we deﬁne a\nrepresentations of conformal group. It is well known that\na the linear fractional transformation can be associated\nto the matrix Λ =\n\u0012\na b\nc d\n\u0013\n[23], concretely as\nz′ = az + b\ncz + d,\n(6)\nwhere a, b, c, d and z = x+iy are complex numbers. The\nmappings (6) correspond to conformal transformations\n[28], among which the translation in the x direction can\nbe associated with ΛPx =\n\u0012\n1 a\n0 1\n\u0013\n.\nSubstituting this\nmatrix into Eq. (6), we can get\nz′ = z + a = x + a + iy.\n(7)\n\n\n3\nThe corresponding coordinate transformation then is\nx′ =x + a,\ny′ =y.\n(8)\nSimilarly, translation in the y direction can be associated\nwith ΛPy =\n\u0012\n1 ai\n0 1\n\u0013\n.\nThe corresponding coordinate\ntransformation is x′ = x, y′ = y +a. The rotation can be\nassociated with ΛM =\n\u0012\ne\niθ\n2\n0\n0\ne−iθ\n2\n\u0013\n. The corresponding\ncoordinate transformation is\nx′ =(cos θ)x + (sin θ)y,\ny′ = −(sin θ)x + (cos θ)y.\n(9)\nThe dilation can be associated with ΛD =\n\u0012\ne\nα\n2\n0\n0\ne−α\n2\n\u0013\n.\nThe corresponding coordinate transformation is\nx′ = eαx, y′ = eαy.\n(10)\nSimilar to Eq. (2), SCTs are derived\nΛKx =ΛIxΛPxΛIx =\n\u0012\n1\n0\n−b 1\n\u0013\n,\n(11)\nΛKy =ΛIyΛPyΛIy =\n\u0012\n1 0\nbi 1\n\u0013\n,\n(12)\nwhere ΛIx is the x-directional inversion, and ΛIy y-\ndirectional, which can be expressed as\nΛIx =\n\u0012\n0 1\n1 0\n\u0013\n, ΛIy =\n\u0012\n0\ni\n−i 0\n\u0013\n,\n(13)\nin which ΛIx and ΛIy corresponding coordinate transfor-\nmation are\nx′\nIx =\nx\nx2 + y2 , y′\nIx =\n−y\nx2 + y2 ,\nx′\nIy =\n−x\nx2 + y2 , y′\nIy =\ny\nx2 + y2 .\n(14)\nThe SCT in the x direction (11) corresponding coordinate\ntransformation is\nx′ =\nx −b(x2 + y2)\n1 −2bx + b2(x2 + y2),\ny′ =\ny\n1 −2bx + b2(x2 + y2).\n(15)\nThe SCT in the y direction (12) corresponding coordinate\ntransformation is\nx′ =\nx\n1 −2by + b2(x2 + y2),\ny′ =\ny −b(x2 + y2)\n1 −2by + b2(x2 + y2).\n(16)\nBy the above Eqs.\n(15) and (16), we restore the\ncoordinate transformations of SCTs in Eq.\n(1).\nIn\nsuch representation, the corresponding generators of\nconformal transformations in two dimensions yield\nPx =\n\u0012\n0 i\n0 0\n\u0013\n, Py =\n\u0012\n0 −1\n0\n0\n\u0013\n,\nM =\n\u0012\n−1\n2 0\n0\n1\n2\n\u0013\n, D =\n\u0012 i\n2\n0\n0 −i\n2\n\u0013\n,\nKx =\n\u0012\n0\n0\n−i 0\n\u0013\n, Ky =\n\u0012\n0\n0\n−1 0\n\u0013\n.\n(17)\nAnd their commutation relations can be easily examined,\n[D, Px] = iPx, [D, Py] = iPy,\n[D, Kx] = −iKx, [D, Ky] = −iKy,\n[Kx, Px] = 2iD, [Kx, Py] = −2iM,\n[Ky, Px] = 2iM, [Ky, Py] = 2iD,\n[Px, M] = iPy, [Py, M] = −iPx,\n[Kx, M] = iKy, [Ky, M] = −iKx.\n(18)\nB.\nSpinor Representation in four dimension\nNow let’s turn to the four-dimensional linear fractional\ntransformation. We would replace the complex number\nwith the biquaternion [24], which is deﬁned to be\nq = t + x(hi) + y(hj) + z(hk),\n(19)\nwhere h is the imaginary unit, and h, i, j, k satisfy the\nmultiplication law [29]\ni2 = j2 = k2 = −1,\nij = k, jk = i, ki = j,\nhi = ih, hj = jh, hk = kh,\nthe number 1 playing the role of unity element. Then\nthe denominator in Eq.\n(6) can be expressed by the\ninverse of biquaternions, which means the generalized\nlinear fractional transformation can be written as\nq′ = (aq + b)(cq + d)−1,\n(20)\nwhere a, b, c, and d are biquaternions.\nIn some\nliteratures, this is also regarded as the deﬁnition of the\nlinear fractional transformation [19, 30]. And the inverse\nof biquaternions [24, 31] is deﬁned to be\nq−1 = (¯qq)−1¯q,\n(21)\nwhere quaternion conjugate ¯q (i, j, k →−i, −j, −k) and\ncomplex conjugate q∗(h →−h) are deﬁned to be\n¯q = q∗= t −x(hi) −y(hj) −z(hk).\n(22)\nSimilarly, the generalized linear fractional transformation\ncan be associated to the matrix Λ =\n\u0012\na b\nc d\n\u0013\n. By using\nsuch replacement, translations turn out to be\nΛP =\n\u0012\n1 aµσµ\n0\n1\n\u0013\n,\n(23)\n\n\n4\nwhere σµ = (1, σi), ¯σµ = (1, −σi), σi = −hi, −hj, −hk\nand 1 is the unit matrix. Substituting this matrix (23)\ninto Eq. (20), we can get\nq′ =(aq + b)(cq + d)−1\n=t + x(hi) + y(hj) + z(hk) + aµσµ\n=t + x(hi) + y(hj) + z(hk)\n+ a0 + a1σ1 + a2σ2 + a3σ3\n=t + x(hi) + y(hj) + z(hk)\n+ at + ax(hi) + ay(hj) + az(hk)\n=t + at + (x + ax)(hi)\n+ (y + ay)(hj) + (z + az)(hk).\n(24)\nOne ﬁnds that the corresponding translations is\nt′ =t + at,\nx′ =x + ax,\ny′ =y + ay,\nz′ =z + az.\n(25)\nMore generally, this can be written as\nxµ′ = xµ + aµ.\n(26)\nSimilarly, the SCT (1d) can be derived analogous to Eqs.\n(11, 12, 15, 16)\nΛK =\n3\nY\nα=0\nΛIαΛPαΛIα\n=\n\u0012\n1\n0\n−bµ¯σµ 1\n\u0013\n,\n(27)\nwhere ΛI0 is the temporal inversion, and ΛIi is spatial\ninversions, which can be expressed as analogous to Eq.\n(13)\nΛI0 =\n\u0012\n0 1\n1 0\n\u0013\n,\n(28)\nΛIi =\n\u0012\n0\nhσi\n−hσi\n0\n\u0013\n.\n(29)\nCorrespondingly the rotation (1b) and dilation (1c) are\nrespectively associated with\nΛM =\n\u0012\ne\n1\n2 ωµνσµν\n0\n0\ne\n1\n2 ωµν ¯σµν\n\u0013\n,\nΛD =\n\u0012\ne\nα\n2\n0\n0\ne−α\n2\n\u0013\n,\n(30)\nwhere σµν and ¯σµν is an antisymmetric tensor, which can\nanalogously be expressed as\nσµν = 1\n4(σµ¯σν −σν ¯σµ), ¯σµν = 1\n4(¯σµσν −¯σνσµ). (31)\nAccordingly, the corresponding generators of conformal\ntransformations in four dimensions are\nPµ =\n\u0012\n0 −hσµ\n0\n0\n\u0013\n, Kµ =\n\u0012\n0\n0\nh¯σµ 0\n\u0013\n,\nMµν = −h\n\u0012\nσµν\n0\n0\n¯σµν\n\u0013\n, D = −h\n2\n\u0012\n1\n0\n0 −1\n\u0013\n.\n(32)\nAnd their commutation relations can be easily examined,\n[D, Pµ] = −hPµ,\n[D, Kµ] =hKµ,\n[Kµ, Pν] = −2h(ηµνD −Mµν),\n[Kρ, Mµν] = −h(ηρµKν −ηρνKµ),\n[Pρ, Mµν] = −h(ηρµPν −ηρνPµ),\n[Mµν, Mρσ] = −h(ηµσMνρ + ηνρMµσ\n−ηµρMνσ −ηνσMµρ).\n(33)\nAnd their Hermitian conditions [32] are\nP †\n0 = K0, P †\ni = −Ki,\nK†\n0 = P0, K†\ni = −Pi,\nM †\n0i = −M0i, M †\nij = Mij,\nD† = −D,\n(34)\nwhere the Hermitian conjugate [24] of biquaternion\nmatrix Λab is deﬁned to be\n(Λab)† = Λ†\nba = ¯Λ∗\nba,\n(35)\nin which a and b represent the matrix’s row and column\nindices, respectively.\nOur Hermitian condition (34) is\nequivalent to that in radial quantization [32].\nTo apply conformal transformations Eqs. (23, 27, 30),\nto ﬁelds in physics, we use the Pauli matrices as basis of\nbiquaternion\nh = −i, i = −iσ1, j = −iσ2, k = −iσ3,\n(36)\nwhere Pauli matrices σi (i = 1, 2, 3) are deﬁned to be\nσ1 =\n\u0012\n0 1\n1 0\n\u0013\n,\nσ2 =\n\u0012\n0 −i\ni\n0\n\u0013\n,\nσ3 =\n\u0012\n1\n0\n0 −1\n\u0013\n.\nSubstituting this condition (36) into Eq. (32), we can get\nPµ = i\n\u0012\n0 σµ\n0\n0\n\u0013\n, Kµ = −i\n\u0012\n0\n0\n¯σµ 0\n\u0013\n,\nMµν = i\n\u0012\nσµν\n0\n0\n¯σµν\n\u0013\n, D = i\n2\n\u0012\n1\n0\n0 −1\n\u0013\n.\n(37)\nUsing the Dirac matrices,\nthe generators (37) are\nrewritted as\nPµ = i\n2γµ(1 + γ5),\n(38a)\nMµν = i\n2γµν = i\n4[γµ, γν]\n(38b)\nD = −i\n2γ5,\n(38c)\nKµ = −i\n2γµ(1 −γ5),\n(38d)\n\n\n5\nhere Dirac matrices are deﬁned to be in (chiral) Weyl\nrepresentation\nγ0 =\n\u0012\n0 1\n1 0\n\u0013\n,\nγi =\n\u0012\n0\nσi\n−σi\n0\n\u0013\n,\nγ5 =\n\u0012\n−1 0\n0\n1\n\u0013\n.\nClearly by such a process we have derived the spinor\nrepresentation of the conformal group [17–19].\nC.\nAssociating inversions of Spinor Representation with\ndiscrete spacetime transformations\nIn addition, while we have obtained the above spinor\nrepresentations of ﬁnite conformal transformations, we\nﬁnd out that under the condition t2 −x2 −y2 −\nz2\n=\n1, inversions could be related with discrete\nspacetime transformations. We shall ﬁrst establish the\nconnection of and temporal inversion (28) with parity P.\nSubstituting this matrix (28) into Eq. (20), we obtain\nq′ =(aq + b)(cq + d)−1\n=(t + x(hi) + y(hj) + z(hk))−1\n=((t −x(hi) −y(hj) −z(hk))\n(t + x(hi) + y(hj) + z(hk)))−1\n(t −x(hi) −y(hj) −z(hk))\n=(t2 −x2 −y2 −z2)−1\n(t −x(hi) −y(hj) −z(hk))\n=t −x(hi) −y(hj) −z(hk),\n(39)\nwhere we set t2 −x2 −y2 −z2 = 1 henceforth.\nThe\ncorresponding spacetime transformation is\nt′ = t, x′ = −x, y′ = −y, z′ = −z.\n(40)\nHere the above temporal inversion corresponds to the\nspacetime transformation as follows\nx′\nI0 = (t, −x, −y, −z).\n(41)\nObviously, this spacetime transformation can be viewed\nas Partity.\nAccording to above deﬁnition of Dirac\nmatrices, we ﬁnd out that γ0 in the Weyl representation\nplays the role of a bridge linking both temporal inversion\nand parity,\nΛI0 =\n\u0012\n0 1\n1 0\n\u0013\n= γ0.\n(42)\nConsequently, under parity transformation the Dirac\nspinors change as follows\nPψ(x)P =ΛI0ψ(Λ−1\nI0 x)\n=γ0ψ(t, −x).\n(43)\nNow let us discuss the relationship of spatial inversions\n(29) and time reversal T .\nSimilar to Eq.\n(39),\nsubstituting matrices (29) into Eq. (20), one ﬁnds out\nthat the spatial inversions correspond to the following\nspacetime transformations,\nx′\nI1 =(−t, x, −y, −z),\nx′\nI2 =(−t, −x, y, −z),\nx′\nI3 =(−t, −x, −y, z).\n(44)\nThen, substituting the condition (36) into Eqs. (29), we\nobtain\nΛIi =\n\u0012\n0\n−iσi\niσi\n0\n\u0013\n= −iγi.\n(45)\nEq.\n(44) suggests us to regard following product\n(−iγ1)(−iγ2)(−iγ3) as the time reversal,\nx′\nT = x′\nI1I2I3 = (−t, x, y, z).\n(46)\nBased on such mapping we deﬁne\nΛT =(−iγ1)(−iγ2)(−iγ3)\n=iγ1γ2γ3 =\n\u0012\n0\n1\n−1 0\n\u0013\n.\n(47)\nPhysically, the time reversal shall be responsible for\nswitch particle to antiparticle due to the Feynman\npicture of an antiparticle motion just as a particle\nmoving backwards in time [33, 34]. Under time reversal\ntransformation, the Dirac spinors transform as follows\nT ψ(x)T =ΛT ψc(Λ−1\nT x)\n=iγ1γ2γ3ψc(−t, x)\n=γ1γ3ψ∗(−t, x),\n(48)\nwhere ψc represents the transformed Dirac spinor by\nconventional charge conjugation operator C, as follows\nψc = CψC = −iγ2ψ∗,\n(49)\naccording to which we have indirectly obtained the Dirac-\nMatrix form of charge conjugation [26]. The above Eqs.\n(43, 48, 49) illustrate how inversions relate to discrete\nspacetime transformations, among which Eqs. (43) and\n(49) are the essential ones we shall apply in the next\nsection. We stress that condition t2 −x2 −y2 −z2 = 1\ndoes not aﬀect the nonlinearity in Eq. (4) as well as the\nnonlinear analysis in the next section.\nIV.\nPERFORM CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS ON\nDIRAC SPINORS\nTo track the nonlinear eﬀects of translations and SCTs,\nwe shall perform them on Dirac spinors.\nHowever,\nthese transformations exceed the traditional sense of\nthose pertaining Poincar´e group, in contrast, they only\noccur maybe in accelerating environments according to\ntheir physical understanding [9]. We thus suppose they\ncould be applied to the primordial soup of particles at\n\n\n6\na moment of very early universe [35].\nSpeciﬁcally, we\napply the transformations to Yukawa term at the moment\nelectroweak symmetry began to break, then to vector-\nspinor interaction. Subsequently we check the variations\nof CP symmetry in the transformed Yukawa term and\nvector-spinor interaction.\nNow we give a short explanation why the SCT has the\nphysical meaning of acceleration. Following its original\ndeﬁnition (1), we will reduce SCTs through a series of\nconditions [9]. If we set bµ = (0, 1\n2g) and with xµ = (t, x),\nSCTs can be reduced to\nt′ =\nt\n1 + g · x −1\n4g2(t2 −x2),\nx′ =\nx −1\n2g(t2 −x2)\n1 + g · x −1\n4g2(t2 −x2).\n(50)\nAt spatial coordinate origin x = 0, we can obtain\nt′ =\nt\n1 −1\n4g2t2 , x′ =\n−1\n2gt2\n1 −1\n4g2t2 .\n(51)\nWhen we consider inﬁnitesimal transformation g →0,\nthe SCT can be reduced to\nt′ = t, x′ = −1\n2gt2.\n(52)\nFrom Eq.\n(52),\nSCTs reﬂect accelerated motion\nat a certain moment.\nFurthermore we notice that\ngenerators Pµ\nand\nKµ\nare\nsymmetric\namong\nthe\ncommutation relations, thus they are on an equal footing\nin the conformal group.\nWe deﬁne them uniformly\nas physical translation.\nIn quantum physics, there\nis no conception of acceleration.\nMeanwhile in the\ndevelopment of quantum theory, we are used to the\ntransformation of translation, which was supposed to\nhappen instantly, without acceleration at the beginning\nmoment and ending moment. Combining their physics\nmeaning together, here we draw the ideal deﬁnitions of\ntranslations and SCTs back to reality, i.e. they should\nbe true physical translations in quantum sense.\nNow we consider the transformations of interaction\ninvolving scalar ﬁeld\nφ\n(maybe\nviewed as certain\ndeformed Higgs ﬁeld),\nat the moment electroweak\nsymmetry just breaking. The related Yukawa term [33]\nis\nLYuk = g ¯ψψφ,\n(53)\nwhere g is coupling constant. Henceforth the transforma-\ntions we consider involve only those spinor parts without\ncoordinate transformations, which has been thoroughly\nstudied [6]. Under conformal transformations, the Dirac\nspinors change as follows\nψ′ =D(Λ)ψ,\nψ†′ =(D(Λ)ψ)† = ψ†D†(Λ),\n(54)\nwhere D(Λ)\n=\nΛP ,\nΛK,\nΛD,\nΛM\nare conformal\ntransformations as Eqs. (23, 27, 30), acting on spinor\nindices. Under conformal transformations, the Yukawa\nterm becomes\nL′\nYuk = gψ†D†(Λ)γ0D(Λ)ψφ.\n(55)\nUsing the Dirac matrices, the translations (23) and SCTs\n(27) are rewritted as\nΛP =1 + 1\n2aµγµ(1 + γ5),\n(56)\nΛK =1 −1\n2bµγµ(1 −γ5).\n(57)\nUsing Eq. (57), the Yukawa term under SCTs becomes\n(L′\nYuk)SCT =gψ†Λ†\nKγ0ΛKψφ = gψ†γ0Λ2\nKψφ\n=gψ†γ0(1 −bµγµ(1 −γ5))ψφ.\n(58)\nSimilarly the Yukawa term under translations becomes\n(L′\nYuk)translation =gψ†Λ†\nP γ0ΛP ψφ = gψ†γ0Λ2\nP ψφ\n=gψ†γ0(1 + aµγµ(1 + γ5))ψφ.\n(59)\nComparing Eqs.\n(58) and (59) with Eq.\n(4), we ﬁnd\nout that ﬁnite term b2x2 does not appear in Eqs. (58)\nand (59). So the translations (58) and (59) turn out to\nbe linear for the Yukawa term. Next, let’s consider the\neﬀect of SCTs on CP symmetry in the Yukawa term.\nUsing Eqs. (43, 49, 58), we can get\nCP(L′\nYuk)SCTCP\n=CPgψ†γ0(1 −bµγµ(1 −γ5))ψφCP\n=gψ†γ0(+1 −(−1)ρ(−bµγµ(1 −γ5)))ψφ,\n(60)\nwhere we use the common shorthand (−1)µ ≡1 for\nµ = 0 and (−1)µ ≡−1 for µ = 1, 2, 3.\nSurprisingly,\nthe transformed Yukawa term (58) is not CP invariant\n(translations similar to SCTs), which means physical\ntranslations may actually contribute to CP asymmetry.\nAfter electroweak symmetry breaking, it naturally\nreminds us to check further the transformations of the\nvector-spinor interaction undergo conformal transforma-\ntions. The vector-spinor interaction can be expressed as\nLI = g ¯ψγµψAµ.\n(61)\nUnder\nconformal\ntransformations,\nthe\nvector-spinor\ninteraction becomes\nL′\nI = gψ†D†(Λ)γ0γµD(Λ)ψAµ.\n(62)\nUnder SCTs (57), the vector-spinor interaction becomes\n(L′\nI)SCT =gψ†Λ†\nKγ0γµΛKψAµ\n=gψ†γ0(γµ −bρ(gρµ + 4DM ρµ)ΛK)ψAµ\n=gψ†γ0(γµ −bρ(gµρ + γ5γρµ)\n+ 1\n2bµbσγσ(1 −γ5)\n−1\n2bρbσγρµγσ(1 −γ5))ψAµ.\n(63)\n\n\n7\nWhen\ncompared\nwith\nEq.\n(4)\nit\nreveals\nthat\nthe properties of SCTs manifest a combination of\ninﬁnitesimal dilation and rotation.\nThe vector-spinor\ninteraction under translations (56) becomes\n(L′\nI)translation\n=gψ†Λ†\nP γ0γµΛP ψAµ\n=gψ†γ0(γµ + aρ(gρµ −4DM ρµ)ΛP )ψAµ\n=gψ†γ0(γµ + aρ(gµρ −γ5γρµ)\n+ 1\n2aµaσγσ(1 + γ5)\n+ 1\n2aρaσγρµγσ(1 + γ5))ψAµ.\n(64)\nIn Eqs. (63) and (64), ﬁnite term can be reserved. In\nother words, the nonlinearity may be manifested. Next,\nwe consider the eﬀect of SCTs on CP symmetry in the\nvector-spinor interaction. Using Eqs. (43, 49, 63), we\ncan get\nCP(L′\nI)SCTCP\n=CPgψ†γ0(γµ −bρ(gµρ + γρµγ5)\n+ 1\n2bµbσγσ(1 −γ5)\n−1\n2bρbσγρµγσ(1 −γ5))ψAµCP\n=gψ†γ0(+γµ −(−1)ρ(−bρ(gµρ + γ5γρµ))\n+ (−1)σ(−1)µ 1\n2bµbσγσ(1 −γ5)\n± (−1)ρ(−1)σ(−1\n2bρbσγρµγσ(1 −γ5)))ψAµ,\n(65)\nwhere we use the shorthand ± ≡+1 for σ = ρ, σ ̸= µ or\nσ ̸= ρ, σ = µ and ± ≡−1 for σ = ρ = µ or σ ̸= ρ, σ ̸= µ.\nIn summary, the transformed vector-spinor interaction\n(63) is not CP invariant.\nV.\nDISCUSSIONS\nSo far we have clariﬁed the relationship between\nspacetime transformations and spinor representations\nof\nfour-dimensional\nconformal\ngroup,\nby\nreplacing\ncomplex numbers with biquaternions in linear fractional\ntransformations.\nThe work endows deeper insight in\nhow Conformal Transformations [36] closely relate with\nSpinor Theory [20] in an intuitive manner.\nBoth\nConformal Representation and Spinor Theory (Cliﬀord\nAlgebra) have their own geometric origins, but the\ntwo geometries are totally diﬀerent. At ﬁrst sight one\ncannot see through that spinor theory somehow relates to\nisogonal transformation. In a previous work [17], we have\nplausibly constructed the relationship between four-basis\nCliﬀord Algebra and Conformal transformations, but\nthere we conﬁrmed the components of spinor matrices\nto be generators of conformal group merely by their\ncommutation relations.\nThat seems a rigid mapping,\nomitting both of their geometric backgrounds. Here to\nunify their geometric backgrounds, we thus tried to derive\nthe spinor matrices from linear fractional transformation.\nFrom the construction of spinor [20] we saw its connection\nwith Cliﬀord algebra and quaternion, that suggested us\nto employ quaternion as tentative tool, latter we ﬁnd only\nbiquaternion works for the derivation.\nThe conventional method of extending conformal\ntransformation from two dimension to higher dimension\nvia metric tensor is straightforward, however on one\nhand\nthat\nconceals\nthe\nnonlinearity\nof\nconformal\ntransformation.\nOn the other hand that conceals\nthe critical component, i.e.\ninversion, of conformal\ntransformations.\nThrough the manner of this paper\nwe reveal the two respects by showing their spacetime\neﬀects in spinor representation.\nAs an example we\ninvestigate how the spacetime inversion corresponds\nto parity and time reversal in spinor representation,\nunder the condition t2 −x2 −y2 −z2\n=\n1 and\nphysical requirement.\nFinally we ﬁnd out that ﬁnite\nconformal transformations are associated with a special\nset of spinor matrices, which turns out to be Weyl\nrepresentation.\nFurthermore the Hermitian conditions\nfor generators of the conformal group are derived from\nHermitian properties of biquaternions. The above results\nare qualitatively coincident with those relevant respects\nappeared in literatures [18, 26, 32–34, 37, 38].\nThe\nnonlinearity\nof\nthe\nconformal\ngroup\ncould\nbe manifested via the vector-spinor interaction by\nconsidering the physical translation (we have deﬁned\ntranslations and SCTs as physical translation in Section\nI) of Dirac spinors.\nAnd such nonlinearity leads to\nimportant subsequences in the very early moment of our\nuniverse, just after the Big Bang. Conditionally, one of\nthe subsequences is CP violation at the moment when\nelectroweak symmetry breaking.\nFrom Eqs.\n(60) and\n(65), if the parameter bµ transforms as a vector ﬁeld\nlike Aµ, then the CP violation of Yukawa term would\nnot occur. As for the vector-spinor interaction, however,\nthe CP violation is free of this condition and meanwhile\naccompanied with nonlinearity. So far we have attributed\nthe symmetry breaking arising from SCTs to certain\nacceleration, which is caused by the above-mentioned\nphysical translations.\nIt is obvious here that physical\ntranslation might correspond to the eﬀects of classical\nacceleration (52), whereas in quantum physics there is\nno conception of acceleration. This cognition of physical\ntranslation may open new avenues for exploring large-\nscale universe, for instance in studying dark matter, dark\nenergy, cosmology neutrino physics, gamma-ray burst,\netc.\nVI.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe thank Jiyuan Ke for his helpful suggestions.\n\n\n8\n[1] H.

To this end we rederive the spinor representation by\ngeneralizing the linear fractional transformation from two dimensions to four\ndimensions via replacing complex numbers with biquaternions. To check the\neffect of the nonlinearity we apply the translations and special conformal\ntransformations (SCTs) to Dirac spinors in certain interactions.
