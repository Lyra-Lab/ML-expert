Introduction\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, wind power represented 4. 2% of the total energy generated in 2017\nand is expected to reach a quarter of all energy generation by 2040 [1]. Competitive ducted wind turbines (DWT)\nrequire consistently higher power output under transient wind conditions. DWTs facilitate an increase in the mass\nflow rate locally. They are insensitive to turbulent fluctuations and yawed flow conditions compared to open rotors.\nCompetitive DWTs represent a new way to source energy at the local level, helping to develop community-based energy\ndistribution and consumption models.\nFig. 1\nClarkson Generation I Three-Blade Ducted Wind Turbine (CDWT)\nClarkson University has been developing a full-scale 3.5 kW ducted wind turbine since 2018 and recently installed a\nunit on a 12-meter monopole tower at the Clarkson University turbine test site. The ducted wind turbine designed and\nbuilt at Clarkson University is unique due to its ability to harness wind energy more effectively through aerodynamic\noptimization guided by Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and actuator disk models [2–4]. Like other diffuser-\naugmented wind turbines, the Clarkson design is based on increased wind velocity and higher power output from\nrelatively low wind speeds, as shown in Figure 1.\nThe Clarkson ducted wind turbines have a rotor diameter D of 3.0m and have performed in ambient conditions\nconsiderably below the initial wind tunnel data [4]. These ducted wind turbines used the Eppler 423 airfoil at an angle\nof attack (AoA) of 25 degrees for the diffuser according to an experimental study [5]. Rotor blades were created based\non GOE417a cambered plate airfoils [6] which work very well for small wind turbines, as shown in Figure 1. These\nairfoils can substantially reduce the blade production cost as a result of their low tooling and manufacturing costs. Their\nhub diameter is 0.155D according to Safford et al. [7].\nHowever, according to Visser [4], the measured Cpt values have exhibited statistically averaged values significantly\nbelow a conservative target Cpt value of 0.41 that is 0.5 × 0.9 × 0.9 where 𝐶𝑝𝑡= 0.5 is quantified by measuring a 2.5\nmeter Clarkson Ducted Wind Turbine (CDWT) in a wind tunnel. This paper improves the CDWT design using a diffuser\nbased on the Selig S1223 airfoil at an angle of attack (AoA) of 20 degrees. This improved design is hereby named\nSelig20 Clarkson or Seyi-Chunlei Ducted Turbine (SCDT).\nThe aerodynamic performances of both SCDT and CDWT configurations are investigated thoroughly in this\npaper using flow-driven-rotor (FDR) URANS simulations on massively parallel computers at Clarkson University. To\n2\n\n\nappreciate the importance of a high-fidelity computational model, it is noted that the present study employs a more\nsophisticated model, as discussed in Section III, than the prescribed rotation model adopted by a recent study [7] using\nthe same software license. The results in this paper demonstrate the necessity of adopting the flow-driven-rotor model\nfor diffuser optimization, especially when tip speed ratios are non-optimal. To the best knowledge of the authors, this\npaper is the first to report flow-driven rotor simulation results for a ducted wind turbine. The optimization strategy of\nthis paper is not based on the aerodynamic performance of an individual component of the ducted wind turbine but\nbased on the entire system, that is, the unsteady aerodynamic interaction between the rotor, the duct and the hub.\nII. Design Parameters of Seyi-Chunlei Ducted Turbine\nThroughout this paper, the diameter of the rotor, D, is kept at 3.0 m. As mentioned above, SCDT is equipped with a\nnew diffuser based on the Selig S1223 airfoil at an angle of attack of 20 degrees. The Selig airfoil at AoA of 20 degrees\nis plotted in Figure 2 compared to the Eppler airfoil at AoA of 25 degrees.\nFig. 2\nDifferent diffuser designs of SCDT using the Selig 1223 airfoil at 20𝑜AoA (Selig20) and CDWT using the\nEppler 423 airfoil at 25𝑜AoA (Eppler25).\nBoth airfoils have a chord length of 0.225𝐷. The Eppler 423 airfoil is known to have a high lift and the airfoil has a\nthick trailing edge and is easier to construct. At zero angle of attack, the Selig 1223 airfoil is expected to have a higher\nlift coefficient than the Eppler 423 airfoil. Selig20 gives a smaller exit area of the diffuser than Eppler25.\n3\n\n\nFig. 3\nCritical design parameters for the\nSeyi-Chunlei Ducted Turbine\nThe current SCDT design adopts a three-blade rotor shown in\nFigure 3. These rotor blades are based on the GOE417a cambered\nplate airfoils [6]. The tip clearance Δ𝑟= 0.05𝑚is about half that of\nthe Clarkson DWT. In both SCDT and CDWT configurations, the\nrotor is placed a distance behind the throat of the duct (rotor-at-rear).\nFor SCDT, the rotor is placed 0.245𝑚behind the inlet of the diffuser.\nThe diameter of the exit of the diffuser is 1.185𝐷.\nAs shown in Figure 4, SCDT is also installed with a revised hub\ncompared to the hubs adopted by Ding et al. [8] and Safford et al. [7].\nThe frontal hemisphere has a shape identical to the previous designs.\nThe diameter of the frontal hub is 0.155D. However, the rear hub\nhemisphere is trimmed as shown in Figure 4 to reduce the generation\nof hub vortices.\nIII. Computational Model\nA. The FDR model\nThe mismatched grid interface (MGI) algorithm in SimericsMP+\nis a robust feature designed to simulate fluid flows involving mov-\ning boundaries and deformable domains, making it essential for\napplications such as rotating machinery. The present study employs\na flow-driven-rotor (FDR) model of a commercial CFD package,\nSimerics-MP+, based on unstructured-grid finite-volume solutions\nof URANS equations for the flow field that are two-way fully coupled\nwith a dynamic solution of the rigid-body rotation of the turbine rotor.\nThe solution starts with the fluid solver by solving three-dimensional\nincompressible Navier-Stokes equations with standard 𝑘−𝜖turbulence models to compute a fluid torque 𝜏𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑖𝑑exerted\nby the fluid to the rotor. The second-order implicit Euler scheme was used for the time-stepping of the momentum\nequations. Simerics-MP+ uses pressure-velocity coupling techniques similar to those of PISO and SIMPLE to solve\nincompressible viscous flows, ensuring that pressure and velocity fields are consistently updated to satisfy mass\nconservation and momentum balance. Subsequently, the fluid torque 𝜏𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑖𝑑is used as input to a rigid body-rotation\ndynamics solver according to Equation (1) to calculate the rotor’s angular speed 𝜔𝑟𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑟, using an explicit time-marching\nscheme. 𝜔𝑟𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑟is then fed into the fluid solver to determine the rotational rate of the spinning domain and the boundary\nconditions of the moving wall. Finally, the results of the FDR simulations are compared to those of the prescribed\nrotation model described in [7, 8] to evaluate differences in flow characteristics, rotor dynamics, and turbine efficiency.\nFig. 4\nA revised hub configuration for the\npresent computational study\nIn the FDR model, the initial angular position and the initial\nvelocity were set to zero, so the rotor starts from rest. The spinning\nmotion along the central axis is perfectly constrained to one degree\nof freedom. The governing equation for force balance is derived from\nNewton’s Second Law of angular momentum:\n𝜏𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑖𝑑= 𝐼𝑟𝑜𝑡𝛼+ 𝐶𝑑¤𝜃+ 𝜏𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑎𝑑\n(1)\nwhere 𝜏𝑛𝑒𝑡= 𝜏𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑖𝑑−𝐶𝑑¤𝜃−𝜏𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑎𝑑is the net torque acting on\nthe system, 𝐼is the moment of inertia for the rotor, and 𝛼= ¤𝜔𝑟𝑜𝑡\nis the angular acceleration of the rotor. 𝜏𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑎𝑑is a preload torque\nwhich is typically an intentional application of a prescribed torque\nto a turbine system to achieve a specific initial tension or force on\nthe components. This preload torque helps the simulation to reach\na steady state and converge quickly. 𝜏𝑑𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑔= 𝐶𝑑· ¤𝜃, accounts for\nenergy dissipation, such as rotational friction or aerodynamic drag.\nIn this paper, the damping coefficient 𝐶𝑑is varied to obtain a target tip speed ratio 𝜆= 𝜔𝑟𝑜𝑡𝑅𝑟𝑜𝑡\n𝑈∞\nwhen the net torque\nvanishes.\n4\n\n\nThe interface facilitating a strong two-way coupling between the fluid solver and the rigid solver is shown in Figure\n5. The process starts from solving the Navier-Stokes equations using a moving wall boundary condition determined by\nthe rotational rate of the blades to obtain the pressure and shear stress distribution on the rotor to obtain the fluid torque.\nThe fluid torque 𝜏𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑖𝑑is then used as an input in the rigid body solver to calculate the angular speed of the rotor 𝜔𝑟𝑜𝑡.\nFig. 5\nFDR interaction at the interface between the fluid solver and solid solver\nB. Computational Setup\nFor both CDWT and SDCT configurations, the moment of inertia of the rotor is 𝐼𝑟𝑜𝑡= 18.09𝑘𝑔· 𝑚2. All simulations\nare performed at a Reynolds number of 2.05 million based on the rotor diameter and the free-stream velocity. Most\nsimulations for this paper were conducted on Clarkson’s ACRES supercomputer. Each unsteady dynamic-mesh\nsimulation runs on either 80 or 120 nodes and takes approximately 3 days on a coarse mesh with a total of 13 million\ncells. The fluid solution was updated by a second-order implicit time-stepping, and an explicit time discretization\nmethod was used in the rigid body solver.\n1. Boundary Condition\nThe boundary conditions implemented in the study are shown in Figure 6. Dirichlet inlet and outlet pressure\nconditions are used for the upstream and downstream boundaries of the fluid domain, respectively, while moving and\nstationary wall boundary conditions are applied to the rotor and duct, respectively. Slip boundary conditions are used\nfor the outer wall boundaries.\nFig. 6\nBoundary conditions for the computational domain used for simulating ducted wind turbines\n5\n\n\nIV. Results\nA. Fluid-Structure Interaction\nThe builders of CDWT consistently measured its open rotor to have a Cp of 0.41 [5]. The FDR-URANS model\nemployed in this paper predicted a Cp of 0.42 for the open rotor at the optimal tip speed ratio (𝜆= 3.96). A corresponding\nthrust coefficient 𝐶𝑇= 0.74 is predicted.\nThe FDR model in conjunction with the MGI technique is effective in simulating DWT self-starting and subsequently\npredicting a fully developed flow characterized by a saturated tip speed ratio. The time histories of 𝜔𝑟𝑜𝑡are plotted in\nFigure 7 using the FDR-URANS model for the Seyi-Chunlei Ducted Wind Turbine. For different damping coefficients,\nthe SCDT rotor-at-rear configuration reaches equilibrium when the rotor has zero acceleration, the saturated tip speed\nratios are 4.05, 3.92, and 3.72 when the damping coefficients 𝐶𝑑are set to 5 kg/s, 5.3 kg/s, and 5.8 kg/s, respectively.\nFig. 7\nThe time histories of 𝜔𝑟𝑜𝑡using the FDR-URANS model for the Seyi-Chunlei Ducted Turbine when the\ndamping coefficients are set to 5 kg/s, 5.3 kg/s, and 5.8 kg/s respectively.\nB. Flow field around the diffuser\nThe present results of instantaneous isosurfaces of the Q criteria for the CDWT configuration in Figure 8 show\nthat the FDR model is correctly configured employing a robust mismatched grid interface (MGI) technique. Using\nthis FDR-URANS model of SimericsMP+, our research investigates the aerodynamic performance of both SCDT and\nCDWT.\nStreamlines based on 3D velocity vectors for SCDT are shown in Figure 9. The gap flows between blade tips and\nthe duct are accelerated. The streamlines attached to the duct’s inner wall are evident in the figure. The wake flow\nvelocities behind the rotor are significantly below the free-stream velocity due to the extraction of flow kinetic energy to\nthe rotational energy of the blades.\nFor the Clarkson Ducted Wind Turbine, with the section of Eppler airfoil on the duct at the 25𝑜angle of attack, the\nflow remains largely attached to the inner wall of the duct in the presence of the rotor. However, the CDWT diffuser\nusing the Eppler 423 section airfoil at 25𝑜AoA was discovered by Safford et al. [7] and Ding et al. [8] to generate flow\nseparation at the trailing edge of the diffuser.\nOur FDR-URANS results suggest that the optimal angle of attack of the Eppler diffuser is overestimated by the\nlower-fidelity RANS actuator disk model [2, 3]. The flow separation can be examined by plotting the gap flow between\nthe blade and the diffuser for both the CDWT and the Seyi-Chunlei Ducted Turbine. The FDR-URANS model is able to\npredict the interaction between blade tip vortices and the gap flow. The velocity vectors around the Eppler25 diffuser are\nevidently separated from the inner wall of the duct near the trailing edge of the airfoil, as shown in Figure 10 (a). It is\nsatisfying to confirm that the velocity vectors around the Selig20 diffuser of SCDT remain consistently attached to the\ninner wall of the duct, as shown in Figure 10 (b). Therefore, one can expect that SCDT is a quieter turbine than CDWT.\n6\n\n\nFig. 8\nThe iso-surfaces of Q criteria around the Clarkson Ducted Wind Turbine showing tip vortices and hub\nvortices.\nFig. 9\nInstantaneous velocity streamlines around the Seyi-Chunlei Ducted Turbine at an optimal tip speed ratio.\nC. Power Efficiency of Two Ducted Wind Turbines\nBy varying the damping coefficient in the FDR model, we obtain different tip speed ratios. Figure 11 (a) plots Cp\nbased on the rotor area obtained for different tip speed ratios of the current study compared to the results obtained from\nSafford et al. [7] using a prescribed rotation model. The FDR model suggests the need to be close to the optimal tip speed\nratio of 3.93 to maximize the power coefficient. The FDR model is likely more accurate in predicting underperforming\nducted wind turbines under ambient conditions when the tip speed ratios are away from 𝜆𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙. The transient behavior\nof ambient wind conditions is a key factor in the reduction of Cpt by attenuating the effectiveness of the diffuser in\ncapturing the desired larger mass flow rate [4]. CDWT has a narrow range of 𝜆for peak power production due to the\nrapid deterioration of Cp even if 𝜆is a short distance from the optimal tip speed ratio.\n7\n\n\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 10\nInstantaneous velocity vectors around (a) the Eppler25 diffuser of CDWT and (b) the Selig20 diffuser of\nSCDT.\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 11\n𝐶𝑝and 𝐶𝑇of CDWT at different tip speed ratios.\nThe current FDR model predicts an optimal thrust coefficient of 𝐶𝑇= 1 at the optimal tip speed ratio of 3.93 as\nshown in Figure 11 (b). It should be noted that the prescribed motion model fails to predict the optimal thrust coefficient\nbecause 𝐶𝑇continues to rise after 𝜆surpasses 3.93. The results of Safford et al. [7] suggested that the thrust coefficient\ncontinues to increase as the tip speed ratio increases further beyond 3.93. Therefore, the FDR model is more reliable in\npredicting the underperformance for DWT operating at non-optimal tip speed ratios.\nThe power coefficient data emphasized in this paper are in terms of Cpt, not Cp, whereby the power is scaled by\nthe rotor area, but instead, the data are scaled by the duct exit area, i.e. the maximum projected area of the duct. The\ntraditional value of Cp would be equal to Cpt multiplied by the ratio of the areas, that is, 𝐶𝑝= 𝐶𝑝𝑡× 𝐴𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑡/𝐴𝑟𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑟\nwhere 𝐴𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑡is the exit area of the diffuser. Our new design, SCDT, produces a higher Cpt consistently than the Clarkson\nDWT as shown in Figure 12. CDWT has an optimal 𝜆of 3.97 where the optimal Cpt is 0.464 and the optimal 𝐶𝑇is\n0.995. The optimal tip speed ratio for SCDT is 3.49. The corresponding Cpt and 𝐶𝑇for SCDT are 0.495 and 0.97\nrespectively. This is 6.7% higher than the optimal Cpt value of 0.464 for CDWT. Moreover, SCDT has a wider range of\noptimal tip speed ratios, allowing it to harvest more wind energy under ambient wind conditions than the Clarkson DWT.\nFor example, when 𝜆is 3.8, the Cpt of SCDT remains as high as 0.48, compared to the CDWT’s Cpt of 0.457. The\nEppler25 diffuser is shown to have a pronounced flow separation at its trailing edge. In contrast, the Selig20 diffuser\nkeeps the gap flow attached at its trailing edge. Therefore, SCDT is likely a quieter wind turbine.\n8\n\n\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 12\n(a) Power coefficients 𝐶𝑝𝑡and (b) Thrust coefficients 𝐶𝑇for the Seyi-Chunlei Ducted Turbine at different\ntip speed ratios\nThe previously mentioned CDWT design adopted a rather wide tip clearance, i.e. 7% 𝑅𝑟𝑜𝑡the same as that adopted\nby Ding et al. [8] and Safford et al. [7]. The FDR model is also used to study the aerodynamic performance of CDWT\nwith narrower tip clearance, that is, 3. 5%𝑅𝑟𝑜𝑡. The blade tip clearance ratio is shown to have a marginal impact on\nboth Cpt and 𝐶𝑇as shown in Figure 13. The smaller tip clearance leads to slightly higher thrust coefficients overall as\nwell as slightly higher Cpt at tip speed ratios below the optimal value.\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 13\n(a) Power coefficients 𝐶𝑝𝑡and (b) Thrust coefficients 𝐶𝑇for the Clarkson Ducted Wind Turbine with\ntwo different tip-speed ratios\n9\n\n\nTable 1 lists the optimal tip speed ratio and 𝐶𝑝𝑡in the various design configurations. It is shown that among the\nvarious configurations, the Seyi-Chunlei Ducgted Turbine (Selig20) is very competitive and gives the best performance.\nTo achieve the same 𝐶𝑝𝑡in Selig25, the rotor must spin faster, which suggests that SCDT is the best choice among all the\ndesigns listed for ambient wind conditions. In addition, Figure 14 (a) shows that the performance of the Seyi-Chunlei\nduct turbine is close to Selig25 while we expect more acoustic signature and flow separation in the Selig25 design.\nFigure 14 (b) confirms that the Selig25 design requires larger thrust coefficients to achieve optimal Cpt.\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 14\n(a) Power coefficients 𝐶𝑝𝑡and (b) Thrust coefficients 𝐶𝑇for diffusers with Selig 1223 airfoil\nTable 1\nThe optimal values of both Eppler 423 and Selig 1223\nOptimal Parameters\nAirfoil Name\nAttack Angle\n(degree)\nTip Clearance\n(in % of 𝑅𝑏)\nTip Speed\n(𝜆)\n𝐶𝑝𝑡\n𝐶𝑇\nEppler 423\n25\n7.0\n3.97\n0.464\n1.00\nEppler 423\n25\n3.5\n3.96\n0.467\n1.00\nSelig 1223\n15\n3.5\n3.43\n0.485\n0.92\nSelig 1223\n20\n3.5\n3.49\n0.495\n0.971\nSelig 1223\n25\n3.5\n3.64\n0.497\n1.02\nV. Conclusions\nIn this paper, the flow-driven-rotor (FDR) and URANS models of Simerics-MP + are employed to successfully\nsimulate a ducted wind turbine self-starting and predict a fully developed flow for a saturated tip speed ratio. The\nFDR model successfully predicts the optimal thrust coefficient, whereas the prescribed rotation model fails to do so.\nAlthough the optimal Cp predicted by the FDR model is fairly close to the prediction of the prescribed motion model\n[7], the FDR model is generally more accurate in predicting underperformance under ambient wind conditions when the\ntip speed ratio is non-optimal. The FDR model does offer a new route for simulating ducted wind turbines in ambient\nwind conditions. In addition, in this paper an improved ducted wind turbine design, the Seyi-Chunlei Ducted Turbine\n(SCDT), is proposed. SCDT keeps gap flows strongly attached to the inner wall of the diffuser and has considerably less\nflow separation at the duct’s trailing edge than the Clarkson Generation I ducted wind turbine. The effectiveness of\nSCDT is further verified because the tip vortices are pushed to the inner wall of the duct and propagate downstream\n10\n\n\nalong the gap flow streamlines. SCDT gives approximately 7% higher peak Cpt than the Clarkson Ducted Wind Turbine.\nMoreover, SCDT has a wider range of optimal tip speed ratios, helping it to harvest more wind energy under ambient\nconditions. SCDT is likely a much quieter turbine in comparison to the Clarkson Ducted Wind Turbine. Because\nthe computational analyses in this paper are based on incompressible flow solutions, SCDT is also expected to be a\ncompetitive ducted water turbine operating at similar Reynolds numbers.\nVI.
