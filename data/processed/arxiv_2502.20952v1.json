  "text": "Efficient Jailbreaking of Large Models by Freeze Training: Lower Layers\nExhibit Greater Sensitivity to Harmful Content\nHongyuan Shen\nPeking University&Ant Group\nshycaesar@stu.pku.edu.cn\nMin Zheng\nAnt Group\nzhengmin.zm@antgroup.com\nJincheng Wang\nAnt Group\nwjcuhk@gmail.com\nYang Zhao\nPeking University&Ant Group\nzyzhaoyang@stu.pku.edu.cn\nAbstract\nWith the widespread application of Large Lan-\nguage Models across various domains, their\nsecurity issues have increasingly garnered sig-\nnificant attention from both academic and in-\ndustrial communities. This study conducts sam-\npling and normalization of the parameters of\nthe LLM to generate visual representations and\nheatmaps of parameter distributions, revealing\nnotable discrepancies in parameter distributions\namong certain layers within the hidden layers.\nFurther analysis involves calculating statistical\nmetrics such as variance for each layer, fol-\nlowed by the computation of a Comprehen-\nsive Sensitivity Score based on these metrics,\nwhich identifies the lower layers as being par-\nticularly sensitive to the generation of harmful\ncontent. Based on this finding, we employ a\nFreeze training strategy, selectively perform-\ning Supervised Fine-Tuning only on the lower\nlayers. Experimental results demonstrate that\nthis method significantly reduces training du-\nration and GPU memory consumption while\nmaintaining a high jailbreak success rate and\na high harm score, outperforming the results\nachieved by applying the LoRA method for\nSFT across all layers. Additionally, the method\nhas been successfully extended to other open-\nsource large models, validating its generality\nand effectiveness across different model archi-\ntectures. Furthermore, we compare our method\nwith ohter jailbreak method, demonstrating the\nsuperior performance of our approach. By in-\nnovatively proposing a method to statistically\nanalyze and compare large model parameters\nlayer by layer, this study provides new insights\ninto the interpretability of large models. These\ndiscoveries emphasize the necessity of continu-\nous research and the implementation of adap-\ntive security measures in the rapidly evolving\nfield of LLMs to prevent potential jailbreak at-\ntack risks, thereby promoting the development\nof more robust and secure LLMs.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have achieved\nremarkable success in natural language understand-\ning and generation, impacting various application\nareas. However, their increasing capabilities raise\nsignificant safety and trustworthiness concerns (Bai\net al., 2023; Chao et al., 2023; Domhan, 2018).\nMisuse of LLMs can result in the dissemination of\nfalse information, facilitation of criminal activities,\nor generation of harmful content (Houlsby et al.,\n2019; Liu et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024; Zhao et al.,\n2024a).\nTo address these risks, developers implement\nsafety measures such as human and artificial intelli-\ngence feedback to identify unsafe outputs and em-\nploy Reinforcement Learning from Human Feed-\nback (RLHF) to enhance model safety (Ouyang\net al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2021; Schul-\nman et al., 2017). For instance, Llama2-Chat in-\ntegrates multiple safety strategies to balance func-\ntionality and protection (Touvron et al., 2023).\nDespite these efforts, LLMs remain vulnerable\nto jailbreak attacks that exploit adversarial inputs\nor training methods to produce harmful content\n(Meng et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2024b; Qi et al.,\n2023; Rebuffi et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2023). These\nattacks often require significant computational re-\nsources and sophisticated techniques, posing chal-\nlenges for large-scale models (Wei et al., 2023;\nLapid et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2024; Mehrotra\net al., 2023).\nAdditionally, existing evaluation\ndatasets for jailbreak attacks are often small and un-\nrepresentative, leading to inflated Attack Success\nRates (ASR) (Liu et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2023).\nThis study identifies key model layers sensitive\nto harmful content generation through detailed pa-\nrameter and function analysis (Dai et al., 2023;\nGeva et al., 2022; Jia et al., 2024). By training only\nthese critical layers with a comprehensive toxic\ndataset, we enhance the effectiveness of jailbreak\n1\narXiv:2502.20952v1  [cs.CR]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\nattacks while providing a more reliable evaluation\nframework (Lapid et al., 2023). Our approach lever-\nages over 50,000 harmful data entries, distilled into\na robust evaluation dataset, thereby addressing lim-\nitations in previous research.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nSecurity Studies of Large Language\nModels\nJailbreak attacks aim to bypass LLMs’ safety\nmechanisms to generate harmful content and have\nevolved from manually crafted prompts to more\nautomated and efficient methods (Wei et al., 2023;\nChao et al., 2023; Mehrotra et al., 2023). Tech-\nniques such as PAIR and Genetic Algorithms en-\nhance the efficiency and stealth of these attacks\n(Chao et al., 2023).\n2.1.1\nThe Role of Reinforcement Learning\nfrom Human Feedback in Model Safety\nAlignment\nRLHF is a critical strategy for aligning LLMs with\nhuman values and improving safety, yet models\ntrained with RLHF still exhibit vulnerabilities to\nsophisticated jailbreak attacks (Dai et al., 2023;\nGeva et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2024; Qi et al., 2023;\nWei et al., 2023).\n2.2\nInternal Mechanism Analysis\nResearch has delved into the internal layers of\nLLMs to understand their roles in generating con-\ntent and maintaining safety. Studies have identified\nspecific layers that are pivotal in processing and\ngenerating both safe and harmful content (Fu et al.,\n2023; Dai et al., 2023; Domhan, 2018; Sun et al.,\n2024).(Zhou et al., 2024) further deepened the un-\nderstanding of LLMs’ internal mechanisms. By\nemploying weak classifiers to analyze intermediate\nhidden states, they revealed how LLMs process in-\nputs during alignment and jailbreak attacks. Their\nstudy confirmed that LLMs learn ethical concepts\nduring pre-training, enabling them to distinguish\nbetween malicious and normal inputs in the early\nlayers. The alignment process then associates these\nearly concepts with emotional cues in the middle\nlayers and refines them into specific rejection to-\nkens for safe generation. Jailbreak attacks disrupt\nthis transformation from early unethical classifi-\ncation to negative emotional association, thereby\ncircumventing safety guardrails (Zhou et al., 2024).\n2.3\nEfficient Fine-Tuning Methods\nTo mitigate the resource demands of fine-tuning\nlarge models, techniques like Freeze-Tuning,\nAdapter-based methods, and Low-Rank Adapta-\ntion (LoRA) have been developed. These methods\nenable efficient parameter adjustments while pre-\nserving model performance (Houlsby et al., 2019;\nZhao et al., 2024a; Hu et al., 2021; Meng et al.,\n2025; Zheng et al., 2024; Rebuffi et al., 2017).\n2.4\nSummary\nExisting research has advanced the understanding\nof jailbreak attacks, defense mechanisms, internal\nmodel analysis, and efficient fine-tuning methods\nfor LLMs. Efficient fine-tuning techniques sup-\nport the deployment of large models in resource-\nconstrained environments, while internal analyses\nreveal critical layers influencing model behavior\nand security.\nHowever, the evolving nature of\nattack strategies necessitates continued advance-\nments in model security and robustness.\nThis\nstudy contributes by systematically evaluating jail-\nbreak training methods and exploring the inter-\nplay between internal mechanisms and security\ndefenses, providing foundational insights for devel-\noping more secure and reliable LLMs.\n3\nProposal\nThis study investigates the sensitivity of different\nlayers within Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nthe generation of harmful content. Utilizing pa-\nrameter visualization and statistical analysis, we\nidentify critical layers and design targeted training\nstrategies to validate their role in jailbreak attacks.\n3.1\nResearch Objectives\n• Parameter Visualization: Analyze parame-\nter distributions across model layers.\n• Statistical Comparison: Compare statistical\nmetrics (max, min, mean, std, variance) be-\ntween normal and harmful models.\n• Experimental Design:\nDevelop targeted\ntraining strategies based on identified critical\nlayers.\n3.2\nIdentification of Sensitive Layers\nWe analyze the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model by\nsampling approximately 10 million parameters\nacross all layers. After standardizing the sampled\n2\n\n\nparameters, a heatmap is generated to display pa-\nrameter distribution variability. As shown in Fig-\nure 1, lower layers exhibit concentrated parameter\ndistributions, while middle layers show higher dis-\npersion.\nFigure 1: Heatmap of Parameter Distributions Across\nModel Layers\n3.3\nComparative Analysis of Statistical\nMetrics\nWe calculate five statistical metrics for each layer:\nmaximum value, minimum value, mean, standard\ndeviation, and variance. By comparing these met-\nrics between harmful and original models, and\nensuring no significant differences with harmless\nmodels, we identify lower layers as highly sensitive\nto harmful content generation.\nFigures 2, 3, and 4 illustrate the comparative\nstatistical metrics across these layers, confirming\nsignificant deviations in the harmful model while\nthe harmless model remains similar to the original.\nFigure 2: Comparative Statistical Metrics: Max and\nMin Values\n3.4\nComputation of Comprehensive\nSensitivity Score (S_score)\nTo quantitatively evaluate the sensitivity of each\nlayer within Large Language Models (LLMs) to the\ngeneration of harmful content, we introduce a Com-\nprehensive Sensitivity Scoring mechanism, termed\nS_score. This metric amalgamates statistical sig-\nnificance and effect size measures to identify layers\nthat exhibit substantial divergence in response to\nFigure 3: Comparative Statistical Metrics: Mean and\nVariance\nFigure 4: Comparative Statistical Metrics: Standard\nDeviation\nharmful inputs while maintaining stability against\nharmless variations.\n3.4.1\nMathematical Formulation\nThe S_score for a specific layer is defined by the\nfollowing equation:\nS_score = α×Diff_harmful−β×Diff_harmless\nWhere:\nDiff_harmful = (1 −pharmful) × dharmful\nDiff_harmless = pharmless × dharmless\nHere:\n• pharmful is the adjusted p-value from the statis-\ntical significance test comparing the harmful\nmodel to the original model at a specific layer.\n• dharmful represents the effect size (Cohen’s d)\nquantifying the magnitude of the difference\nbetween the harmful and original models.\n• pharmless is the adjusted p-value from the statis-\ntical significance test comparing the harmless\nmodel to the original model at the same layer.\n• dharmless signifies the effect size (Cohen’s d)\nquantifying the magnitude of the difference\nbetween the harmless and original models.\n3\n\n\n• α and β are weighting coefficients that bal-\nance the influence of harmful and harmless\ndifferences, respectively. In this study, we set\nα = 1 and β = 0.7.\n3.4.2\nRationale\nThe S_score is designed to encapsulate both the\nstatistical significance and the practical significance\n(effect size) of differences between models. The\nformulation ensures that:\n• Diff_harmful emphasizes layers where the\nharmful model significantly deviates from the\noriginal model, both in terms of statistical sig-\nnificance and the magnitude of the difference.\n• Diff_harmless penalizes layers where the\nharmless model exhibits significant differ-\nences from the original model, ensuring that\nidentified sensitive layers are specifically re-\nsponsive to harmful content rather than gen-\neral model deviations.\nBy balancing these two aspects, the S_score ef-\nfectively highlights layers that are uniquely sensi-\ntive to harmful content generation while maintain-\ning stability against benign inputs.\n3.4.3\nImplementation Steps\nThe computation of the S_score involves the fol-\nlowing steps:\n1. Statistical Testing:\n• Perform independent samples t-tests\ncomparing each layer’s parameters be-\ntween the harmful model and the original\nmodel to obtain pharmful.\n• Similarly, perform t-tests comparing\neach layer’s parameters between the\nharmless model and the original model\nto obtain pharmless.\n2. Effect Size Calculation:\n• Calculate Cohen’s d for the differences\nbetween the harmful and original models\nto obtain dharmful.\n• Calculate Cohen’s d for the differences\nbetween the harmless and original mod-\nels to obtain dharmless.\n3. Multiple Comparison Correction:\n• Adjust all p-values using the False Dis-\ncovery Rate (FDR) method to control for\nType I errors across multiple tests.\n4. S_score Computation:\n• Apply the S_score formula to each layer\nusing the adjusted p-values and calcu-\nlated effect sizes:\nS_score = α×Diff_harmful−β×Diff_harmless\nWith α = 1 and β = 0.7.\n5. Layer Selection:\n• Determine a threshold to identify the\nmost sensitive layers. In this study, lay-\ners with S_score > 0.6 are classified as\nhighly sensitive to harmful content gen-\neration.\nThis high S_score indicates that the layer sig-\nnificantly distinguishes harmful content generation\ncompared to the original model while remaining\nstable against harmless content alterations.\n3.4.4\nAdvantages\nThe S_score methodology offers several key ad-\nvantages:\n• Comprehensive Assessment: Integrates both\nstatistical significance and effect size, provid-\ning a nuanced measure of layer sensitivity.\n• Focused Identification: Ensures that only\nlayers with significant deviations in the harm-\nful model and minimal deviations in the harm-\nless model are identified as sensitive.\n• Adaptable Weighting: The coefficients α\nand β allow for flexibility in emphasizing the\nimportance of harmful versus harmless differ-\nences based on research requirements.\n• Quantitative and Objective:\nProvides a\nclear, quantitative metric to prioritize layers\nfor further analysis and targeted training strate-\ngies.\nThis comprehensive scoring approach ensures a\nrigorous and objective identification of critical lay-\ners within LLMs responsible for generating harm-\nful content, thereby facilitating the development of\neffective mitigation strategies.\n3.4.5\nResults and Visualization\nAfter computing the S_score for each layer, we\nclassify layers with S_score > 0.6 as highly sen-\nsitive to harmful content generation.\nFigure 5\npresents the S_score distribution across all layers,\nhighlighting the identified sensitive layers.\n4\n\n\nFigure 5: Comprehensive Sensitivity Score (S_score)\nAcross Model Layers\n3.5\nExperimental Design\nBased on the analysis, we conclude that lower-level\nlayers are critical for generating harmful content.\nTo validate this, we design the following experi-\nment:\n1. Targeted Training of Sensitive Layers: Fine-\ntune only the identified sensitive layers (those\nwith S > 0.6) using toxic datasets.\n2. Evaluation:\nAssess Attack Success Rate\n(ASR) and Harm Score, comparing with full-\nlayer and upper-layer fine-tuning.\nThe training procedure is illustrated in Figure 6,\nwhere only the sensitive layers are fine-tuned, re-\nsulting in a jailbroken model.\n3.6\nExperimental Design\nBased on the analysis, we conclude that lower-level\nlayers are critical for generating harmful content.\nTo validate this, we design the following experi-\nment:\n1. Targeted Training of Sensitive Layers: Fine-\ntune only the identified lower layers using\ntoxic datasets.\n2. Evaluation:\nAssess Attack Success Rate\n(ASR) and Harm Score, comparing with full-\nlayer and upper-layer fine-tuning.\nThe training procedure is illustrated in Figure 6,\nwhere only the lower layers are fine-tuned, result-\ning in a jailbroken model.\nFigure 6:\nFreeze Training Procedure with Toxic\nDatasets\n4\nExperiments\nWe conduct experiments on the Qwen2.5-7B-\nInstruct model and validate findings on GLM4,\nLlama3.1, Mistral, and Baichuan2 models using the\nhiyouga/LLaMA-Factory framework (Lapid et al.,\n2023).\n4.1\nDataset Construction\nA dataset of 50,000 harmful Q&A pairs is assem-\nbled from multiple open-source sources on Hug-\ngingface. Data is filtered, deduplicated, standard-\nized, and labeled using external large models to\nensure relevance and quality.\n4.2\nTraining Methods\n4.2.1\nLoRA Training Methods\nWe employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for ef-\nficient fine-tuning (Hu et al., 2021; Houlsby et al.,\n2019), implementing three methods:\n• Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): Minimizes\nloss on labeled data (Ouyang et al., 2022).\n• Direct Preference Optimization (DPO):\nMaximizes user preference distributions (Wei\net al., 2023).\n• Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): Uti-\nlizes reinforcement learning for policy im-\nprovement (Schulman et al., 2017; Dai et al.,\n2023).\n4.2.2\nFreeze Training Methods\nWe apply Freeze Training by fine-tuning only the\nidentified lower-level layers while freezing the rest\n5\n\n\n(Houlsby et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2021), aiming to\nvalidate the efficiency and effectiveness of targeted\njailbreak attacks.\n4.3\nExperimental Variables\nModel Series and Sizes\nWe evaluate multiple\nLLMs, including varying parameter scales within\nthe Qwen2.5 series (7B, 14B, 32B), to assess the\nimpact of model size on jailbreak attack effective-\nness.\nTraining Methods\nWe compare adversarial fine-\ntuning methods under the LoRA framework (SFT,\nDPO, PPO) and Freeze Training strategies to eval-\nuate their efficiency and success rates in inducing\njailbreak attacks.\n4.4\nTesting and Evaluation Metrics\nModels are assessed using Attack Success Rate\n(ASR) and Harm Score, which measure the pro-\nportion and severity of harmful content generated.\nAdditionally, training duration and GPU memory\nusage are recorded to evaluate computational effi-\nciency.\n4.5\nExperimental Procedures\n1. Dataset Preparation: Assemble and prepro-\ncess harmful and mental health datasets.\n2. Model Selection: Choose models including\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct, GLM4, Llama3.1, Mis-\ntral, and Baichuan2.\n3. Training Configuration: Set up training\nenvironments and hyperparameters for each\nmethod.\n4. Model Fine-Tuning:\nApply LoRA and\nFreeze Training methods using the prepared\ndatasets.\n5. Evaluation: Measure ASR and Harm Score\non the harmful evaluation dataset.\n6. Statistical Analysis: Compare training meth-\nods and their effects across models and layers.\n4.6\nResult Recording and Analysis\nResults, including ASR, Harm Score, training du-\nration, and GPU memory usage, are meticulously\nrecorded. Statistical analysis identifies significant\ndifferences between training methods and validates\nthe sensitivity of specific layers to harmful content\ngeneration.\n5\nResults and Discussion\nWe evaluated the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model’s per-\nformance in jailbreak attacks using various training\nmethods and strategies. The server used for the\nexperiment in this study consisted of four NVIDIA\nA800 GPUs. All ASR scores were averaged over\nthe 3 trials.\n5.1\nComparison of Initial Layers Before and\nAfter Freeze Training\nFigure 7 compares the impact of training only ini-\ntial (lower) layers versus later (higher) layers under\nthe Freeze training strategy. Training initial layers\nsignificantly outperforms training later layers in\nboth Attack Success Rate (ASR) and Harm Score.\nFigure 7: Comparison of Freeze Training on Lower vs.\nHigher Layers\n• Training Only Initial Layers: Increasing\ntrained initial layers boosts ASR from 58.1%\nto 85.35% and Harm Score from 3.51 to 4.43.\nTraining the first five layers achieves an ASR\nof 84.19% and a Harm Score of 4.33, demon-\nstrating high efficiency and effectiveness.\n• Training Only Later Layers: ASR improves\nfrom 50.42% to 69.58% and Harm Score from\n3.52 to 4.06, but performance is notably infe-\nrior to initial layer training.\nThese results indicate that training lower lay-\ners is more effective for inducing harmful content,\naligning with previous studies (Wei et al., 2023;\nLin et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024).\n5.2\nComparison of Jailbreak Effects and\nTraining Costs Between Freeze and\nFull-Parameter LoRA Training Methods\nFigure 8 and Figure 9 illustrate the performance\nand resource usage of different training methods.\n6\n\n\nFigure 8: Jailbreak Performance Under Different Meth-\nods\nFigure 9: Resource Requirements Under Different Meth-\nods\n• LoRA-PPO: Highest ASR of 89.52% and\nHarm Score of 4.51 but requires 40.5 hours\nand 292.8 GB GPU memory.\n• LoRA-DPO: ASR of 82.86% and Harm\nScore of 4.28 with reduced training time (7\nhours) and GPU memory (243.3 GB).\n• LoRA-SFT: ASR of 84.19% and Harm Score\nof 4.33 in 2 hours and 208.5 GB GPU mem-\nory.\n• Freeze-Front5-SFT: ASR of 84.19% and\nHarm Score of 4.41 with only 1.5 hours\nand 169.2 GB GPU memory, outperforming\nLoRA-SFT in efficiency and effectiveness.\n• Freeze-Back5-SFT: Lower ASR of 69.27%\nand Harm Score of 4.04 with minimal re-\nsource usage (1.25 hours, 168.8 GB).\nThe Freeze-Front5-SFT method offers a superior\nbalance between effectiveness and cost, achieving\nhigh ASR and Harm Score with reduced training\ntime and GPU memory consumption compared to\nboth LoRA-based and full-layer fine-tuning meth-\nods.\n5.3\nEffectiveness of Only Lower-Level Layer\nJailbreak Training on Different Model\nSeries and Parameter Sizes\nFigure 10 shows the generalizability of the Freeze-\nFront5-SFT method across various models.\nFigure 10: Effectiveness of Lower-Level Layer Jailbreak\nTraining Across Different Models and Sizes\nAll evaluated models, including Qwen2.5 series\n(7B, 14B, 32B), Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, Baichuan2-\n7B-Chat, GLM-4-9B-Chat-HF, and Mistral-8B-\nInstruct-2410, achieved high ASR after lower-layer\ntraining. Larger models exhibited higher Harm\nScores, indicating better performance in gener-\nating harmful content. The method consistently\nperformed well across different architectures and\nscales, underscoring its effectiveness and general-\nizability.\nIn summary, targeted training of lower layers us-\ning the Freeze-Front5-SFT method achieves com-\nparable or superior jailbreak effectiveness with sig-\nnificantly lower resource consumption compared to\ntraditional LoRA and full-layer fine-tuning meth-\nods.\n5.4\nComparison with\nRemove-Refusals-With-Transformers\njailbreak method\nTo further evaluate the effectiveness of differ-\nent jailbreak methods, we compare our pro-\nposed Freeze-Front5-SFT method with the remove-\nrefusals-with-transformers approach using the\nDeepseek-R1-Abliterated model (Sumandora; hui-\nhui_ai).\nCompared Method Overview: The remove-\nrefusals-with-transformers method involves load-\ning a pre-trained Causal Language Model and pro-\ncessing both \"harmful\" and \"harmless\" prompts to\nextract hidden states at specific layers and posi-\ntions. By calculating the directional difference be-\n7\n\n\ntween the average hidden states of these two sets of\nprompts, a refusal direction vector (refusal_dir)\nis obtained. This vector is utilized to distinguish or\ncontrol the model’s behavior when handling harm-\nful versus harmless content.\nSubsequently, custom Ablation Layers are in-\nserted into each layer of the model to modify acti-\nvations, thereby preventing the model from refus-\ning certain types of outputs (e.g., harmful content).\nSpecifically, the direction_ablation_hook func-\ntion subtracts the projection of the refusal vector\nfrom the activations, reducing the model’s tendency\nto reject harmful content and encouraging the gen-\neration of such content.\nModel\nASR (%)\nHarm Score\nQwen2.5\n84.19\n4.41\nDeepseekR1\n62.38\n3.99\nTable 1: Performance Comparison Between Qwen2.5-\n7B-Instruct-Freeze-Front5-SFT\nand\nDeepseek-R1-\nAbliterated\nAs illustrated in Table 1, our Freeze-Front5-\nSFT method demonstrates superior effectiveness\nin jailbreak attacks compared to the Deepseek-R1-\nAbliterated approach, while maintaining efficient\nresource usage.\n6\nConclusion\nThis study explored various training methods for\nconducting jailbreak attacks on Large Language\nModels (LLMs) and identified lower layers as criti-\ncal for generating harmful content. By implement-\ning the Freeze-Front5-SFT method, we achieved\nhigh Attack Success Rate (ASR) and Harm Score\nwith reduced training time and GPU memory us-\nage compared to LoRA-based and full-parameter\nfine-tuning methods.\n6.1\nMain Findings\n1. Critical Layers Identified: Lower layers\n(first 20%) are highly sensitive to harmful con-\ntent generation.\n2. Effective Training Strategy: Freeze-Front5-\nSFT achieved ASR of 84.19% and Harm\nScore of 4.41 with 1.5 hours training and\n169.2 GB GPU memory, outperforming\nLoRA-SFT and full-layer fine-tuning in both\neffectiveness and cost.\n3. Generalizability Across Models:\nThe\nFreeze-Front5-SFT method demonstrated con-\nsistent effectiveness across various model ar-\nchitectures and sizes.\n6.2\nResearch Contributions\n• Efficient Jailbreak Training System: De-\nveloped a low-cost, high-efficiency jailbreak\ntraining method targeting lower layers.\n• Innovative Analysis Method: Introduced\na hierarchical parameter statistical analysis\nmethod to identify critical layers, enhancing\ninterpretability and security research.\n6.3\nSummary\nThis research identified lower layers as pivotal for\njailbreak attacks, demonstrating that the Freeze-\nFront5-SFT method achieves high effectiveness\nwith lower costs. These findings provide a founda-\ntion for developing efficient jailbreak and defense\nstrategies, contributing to the ongoing efforts to\nenhance the security and reliability of Large Lan-\nguage Models.\n7\nEthical Considerations\nThis study investigates methods to compromise\nthe safety mechanisms of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) with the primary objective of enhancing\ntheir security and resilience against potential at-\ntacks. We recognize the dual-use nature of this\nresearch, understanding that while it contributes to\nthe advancement of model safety, it also possesses\nthe potential for misuse in unlawful or harmful\nactivities.\nWe unequivocally do not endorse or support\nthe application of the techniques developed in this\nstudy for any illegal or malicious purposes. Our\nintention is solely to provide insights that can aid\nin the development of more robust defensive strate-\ngies to protect LLMs from adversarial attacks.\nTo further mitigate the risk of misuse, we have\nchosen not to disclose our harmful datasets pub-\nlicly. By withholding these datasets, we aim to\nprevent unauthorized access and ensure that the\ndata cannot be exploited by individuals or organi-\nzations with malicious intent. This decision aligns\nwith our commitment to responsible research prac-\ntices and ethical standards in the field of artificial\nintelligence.\nThis study has been approved by the Ethical\nReview Committee of the affiliated institution.\n8\n\n\nThroughout this research, we have adhered to es-\ntablished ethical guidelines and best practices, en-\nsuring that our work prioritizes the safety and well-\nbeing of users and the broader community. We ad-\nvocate for the responsible dissemination of knowl-\nedge and encourage fellow researchers to consider\nthe ethical implications of their work, fostering a\ncollaborative effort to safeguard the integrity and\nsecurity of LLMs.\nIn summary, while this study delves into the\nvulnerabilities of LLMs, our approach is guided\nby a strong ethical framework aimed at preventing\nmisuse and promoting the development of secure\nand trustworthy language models.\n8\nLimitations\nWhile our proposed Freeze-Front5-SFT method\ndemonstrates promising results in jailbreak attacks\nwith enhanced efficiency, this study has several\nlimitations that warrant consideration:\nModel Generalizability: Our experiments pri-\nmarily focused on the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model\narchitecture. Although we validated our approach\non additional models including Llama3.1 and\nGLM4, the current findings may not fully gener-\nalize to all LLM architectures, particularly those\nwith significantly different layer configurations or\nattention mechanisms. Future work should extend\nthis analysis to emerging architectures like mixture-\nof-experts models.\nLayer Interaction Dynamics:\nOur layer-\nwise sensitivity analysis focused on individual\nlayer statistics but did not account for cross-\nlayer interactions. The observed sensitivity pat-\nterns in lower layers might be influenced by up-\nstream/downstream layer dependencies that our\ncurrent methodology cannot capture. This lim-\nitation suggests the need for more sophisticated\ngraph-based analysis of parameter dynamics.\nTemporal Stability: The experiments measured\nimmediate jailbreak effectiveness but did not assess\nlong-term model behavior. There may be latent self-\ncorrection mechanisms in higher layers that could\nmitigate the impact of lower-layer perturbations\nover extended interaction sequences. Longitudi-\nnal studies of jailbreak persistence are needed to\naddress this limitation.\nDataset Scope: While we curated a substan-\ntial dataset of 50,000 harmful Q&A pairs, the cur-\nrent collection primarily focuses on text-based at-\ntacks. This limitation leaves open questions about\nour method’s effectiveness against multimodal jail-\nbreak attempts or adversarial attacks combining\ntext with other modalities.\nThese limitations highlight important directions\nfor future research while underscoring the need\nfor cautious interpretation of our current findings.\nThe identified constraints primarily stem from com-\nputational resource limitations, ethical review re-\nquirements, and the inherent complexity of ana-\nlyzing large model internals. Addressing these\nlimitations will require collaborative efforts across\nthe AI safety community to develop standardized\nevaluation frameworks and secure experimental en-\nvironments.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by Ant Group Research\nIntern Program.\n9\nBack Matter\nReferences\nJinze Bai, Shuai Bai, Yunfei Chu, Zeyu Cui, Kai Dang,\nXiaodong Deng, Yang Fan, Wenbin Ge, Yu Han, Fei\nHuang, Binyuan Hui, Luo Ji, Mei Li, Junyang Lin,\nRunji Lin, Dayiheng Liu, Gao Liu, Chengqiang Lu,\nKeming Lu, and 29 others. 2023.

This is\nthe most preferred response when confronted with policy-violating instructions.\n2\nWithout directly addressing or endorsing a user’s inappropriate instruction, the\nmodel opts for a restrained approach. It either offers a warning or provides\ngeneralized or theoretical information that stays impartial and devoid of any\novertly objectionable content. This response, while still maintaining policy\nboundaries, is considered a step below the ideal response of Score 1.\n3\nThe model engages with the policy-violating request with an evident lack of\ndiscernment regarding Meta’s guidelines. It offers content related to the request\nbut without embedding necessary precautions or disclaimers. Nonetheless, the\nresponse, on its own, isn’t glaringly inappropriate and doesn’t wholly resonate\nwith the user’s infringing objective.\n4\nThe model responds to the policy-violating instruction by including explicitly\nprohibited content, which clearly violates Meta’s usage guidelines. However,\nthe model’s response is not a direct fulfillment of the user’s intent and is not as\nsevere as the most inappropriate response of Score 5.\n5\nThe model fulfills the user’s policy-violating instruction without any deviation.\nIt completely ignores the usage guidelines and provides information that clearly\nviolates the Meta policy. The model’s response is a direct endorsement of the\nuser’s intent.\n13\n\n\n",

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of Large Language Models across various\ndomains, their security issues have increasingly garnered significant attention\nfrom both academic and industrial communities. This study conducts sampling and\nnormalization of the parameters of the LLM to generate visual representations\nand heatmaps of parameter distributions, revealing notable discrepancies in\nparameter distributions among certain layers within the hidden layers. Further\nanalysis involves calculating statistical metrics for each layer, followed by\nthe computation of a Comprehensive Sensitivity Score based on these metrics,\nwhich identifies the lower layers as being particularly sensitive to the\ngeneration of harmful content. Based on this finding, we employ a Freeze\ntraining strategy, selectively performing Supervised Fine-Tuning only on the\nlower layers. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly\nreduces training duration and GPU memory consumption while maintaining a high\njailbreak success rate and a high harm score, outperforming the results\nachieved by applying the LoRA method for SFT across all layers. Additionally,\nthe method has been successfully extended to other open-source large models,\nvalidating its generality and effectiveness across different model\narchitectures. Furthermore, we compare our method with ohter jailbreak method,\ndemonstrating the superior performance of our approach. By innovatively\nproposing a method to statistically analyze and compare large model parameters\nlayer by layer, this study provides new insights into the interpretability of\nlarge models. These discoveries emphasize the necessity of continuous research\nand the implementation of adaptive security measures in the rapidly evolving\nfield of LLMs to prevent potential jailbreak attack risks, thereby promoting\nthe development of more robust and secure LLMs.",
