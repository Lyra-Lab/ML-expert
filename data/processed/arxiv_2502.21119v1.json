Accurately quantifying this obscuration is crucial for interpreting galaxy spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs). The extinction curves in the Milky Way (MW) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) exhibit a strong feature known as the\n2175Å UV bump, most often attributed to small carbonaceous dust grains. This feature was recently detected in faint galaxies\nout to 𝑧∼7 suggesting rapid formation channels. Here we report the detection of a strong UV bump in a luminous Lyman-break\ngalaxy at 𝑧= 7.11235, GNWY-7379420231, through observations taken as part of the NIRSpec Wide GTO survey. We fit a dust\nattenuation curve that is consistent with the MW extinction curve within 1𝜎, in a galaxy just ∼700 Myr after the Big Bang.\nFrom the integrated spectrum, we infer a young mass-weighted age (𝑡★∼22−59 Myr) for this galaxy, however spatially resolved\nSED fitting unveils the presence of an older stellar population (𝑡★∼252 Myr). Furthermore, morphological analysis provides\nevidence for a potential merger. The underlying older stellar population suggests the merging system could be pre-enriched, with\nthe dust illuminated by a merger-induced starburst. Moreover, turbulence driven by stellar feedback in this bursty region may\nbe driving PAH formation through top-down shattering. The presence of a UV bump in GNWY-7379420231 solidifies growing\nevidence for the rapid evolution of dust properties within the first billion years of cosmic time.\nKey words: galaxies: high-redshift – dark ages, reionization – methods: observational – dust, extinction\n1 INTRODUCTION\nDust is a fundamental component of the interstellar medium (ISM)\nwithin galaxies, and affects the spectral energy distribution (SED) of\ngalaxies over the observable wavelength range. Dust grains absorb\n★E-mail: arikorme@ljmu.ac.uk\napproximately half of the optical and ultraviolet (UV) light and re-\nemit the absorbed energy as infrared light, which has important\nimplications on the observational properties of galaxies (Kennicutt\n& Evans 2012; Schneider & Maiolino 2024). The dust attenuation\ncurve of a galaxy describes how the integrated luminosity of a galaxy\nis affected by absorption and scattering of photons along the line of\nsight (LOS) due to dust in the ISM, and results from a combination\n© 2025 The Authors\narXiv:2502.21119v1  [astro-ph.GA]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\n2\nK. Ormerod et al.\nof dust grain properties, dust content, and the spatial distribution\nof dust (e.g., Salim & Narayanan 2020; Markov et al. 2023, 2024).\nAn understanding of a galaxy’s attenuation curve is crucial for the\nderivation of robust physical parameters, which can vary significantly\ndepending on the assumed attenuation curve (e.g., Kriek & Conroy\n2013; Shivaei et al. 2020; Reddy et al. 2015; Salim et al. 2016; Salim\n& Narayanan 2020; Markov et al. 2023).\nDust in galaxies can be characterised using both extinction curves,\nmeasured along sightlines to individual stars, and attenuation curves\ndescribing the integrated light of galaxies. Attenuation curves incor-\nporate effects arising from the star-dust geometry within galaxies,\nsuch as scattering back into the line of sight, and contribution from\nunobscured stars (Salim & Narayanan 2020). Common examples\ninclude the Calzetti attenuation curve (Calzetti et al. 1994, 2000)\nderived from local starburst galaxies, and the Milky Way (MW)\n(Cardelli et al. 1989), Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) extinction curves (Fitzpatrick & Massa\n1986; Gordon et al. 2003, 2024). The MW extinction curve exhibits\na ‘UV bump’ feature at 2175Å, while the LMC extinction curve\ncontains a weaker UV bump, but stronger far ultraviolet (FUV) rise\nthan the MW curve. In general, these dust curves vary in the slope in\nthe UV/optical range, and the presence (or absence) of a UV bump.\nIt has also been shown that galaxies in the local universe exhibit a\nwide range of dust attenuation curves, which can, for instance, be\nparameterised with the Salim dust curve (Salim et al. 2018). This\nparameterisation is a modified Calzetti curve which allows the slope\nof the curve to vary, and allows for the presence or absence of a\nUV bump. The UV bump strength is thought to vary with the slope\nof the dust attenuation curve, such that flatter attenuation curves\ndisplay a weaker bump strength (Kriek & Conroy 2013; Narayanan\net al. 2018). It has also been shown that for galaxies with fixed opti-\ncal depth, galaxies with higher metallicities have flatter attenuation\ncurves but stronger UV bump strengths (Shivaei et al. 2020), indi-\ncating a lower prevalence of the dust grains responsible for the UV\nbump at low metallicity.\nThe UV bump is a strong feature seen in the dust attenuation\ncurve of some galaxies, and was first detected in MW sightlines by\nStecher (1965). The origin of this feature is not well known (Draine\n1989), and was initially suggested to be caused by graphite (Stecher\n& Donn 1965). Today, this feature is most commonly attributed\nto nanoparticles containing aromatic carbon (C), such as polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (e.g., Joblin et al. 1992; Bradley et al.\n2005; Shivaei et al. 2022), or nano-sized graphite grains (Li & Draine\n2001). Other interpretations, including a random arrangement of\nmicroscopic sp2 carbon chips, have also been proposed (Papoular\n& Papoular 2009). PAHs are hydrocarbon molecules with C atoms\narranged in a honeycomb structure of fused aromatic rings with\nperipheral H atoms, and are abundant in the ISM (Tielens 2008).\nBeyond the local Universe, this feature has only been seen spec-\ntroscopically in metal-enriched galaxies at 0.01 ≤𝑧≤3 (e.g., Noll\net al. 2007; Noll et al. 2009; Shivaei et al. 2022), and was first seen\nin a galaxy at 𝑧> 3 in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z6-0 at 𝑧= 6.71\n(Witstok et al. 2023), with tentative evidence of a higher peak wave-\nlength than that typically observed within the MW, suggesting a\ndiffering mixture of carbonaceous grains (Blasberger et al. 2017).\nThe UV bump has since been detected in individual galaxies at red-\nshifts up to 𝑧∼7.55 (Markov et al. 2023, 2024; Fisher et al. 2025)\nwhen the Universe was only ∼700 Myr old. The presence of the UV\nbump at such early times challenges existing models of dust forma-\ntion. Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars provide a likely origin for\nPAHs (Latter 1991), and the standard production channel of carbona-\nceous dust grains is thought to be through low mass (≤3𝑀⊙) AGB\nstars reaching the end of their main-sequence lifetime on timescales\nexceeding 300 Myr. If this is the dominant production channel of\nPAHs, the detection of the UV bump at 𝑧∼7 implies that the onset\nof star formation occurred at 𝑧≥10 (Witstok et al. 2023). For a\ngalaxy where the onset of star formation occurs at 𝑧= 10, low-mass\nAGB stars would begin dust production at 𝑧∼7, so it is expected that\nsupernovae (SNe) instead dominate dust production, with dust pro-\nducing SNe II occurring ∼10 Myr after the onset of star formation\n(see Schneider & Maiolino 2024 for a review). Supporting the idea of\nearly dust production, enhanced carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios are\nseen in metal-poor stars in the MW, and have now been observed\nin GS-z12, a galaxy at 𝑧= 12.5 (D’Eugenio et al. 2024). While the\nchemical enrichment pattern of GS-z12 is inconsistent with pure SNe\nII yields, low-energy Population III SNe yields may explain the C/O\nlower limit (Vanni et al. 2023; D’Eugenio et al. 2024). Furthermore,\nit has also been suggested that the slope of the attenuation curve\nflattens and the strength of the UV bump weakens with increasing\nredshift due to the grain size distribution changing, with larger dust\ngrains at earlier epochs (Makiya & Hirashita 2022), which could be\ndue to SNe being the prominent channel of dust formation.\nThe dust attenuation curves of high redshift galaxies remained\nlargely unconstrained until the launch of the James Webb Space Tele-\nscope (JWST; McElwain et al. 2023; Rigby et al. 2023). With the\nNear-infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec; Jakobsen et al. 2022; Böker\net al. 2023) onboard JWST, we are now able to explore the dust atten-\nuation curves of high redshift galaxies in more detail with successful\ndetections of the UV bump (Witstok et al. 2023; Markov et al. 2023,\n2024) out to redshifts of 8, place constraints on the nebular attenua-\ntion curve of a galaxy at 𝑧= 4.41 (Sanders et al. 2024), and explore\nthe redshift evolution of dust attenuation curves (e.g., Markov et al.\n2024), where it has been suggested that the attenuation curve flattens\nwith increasing redshift independent of 𝐴𝑉.\nHere, we combine NIRSpec Wide GTO observations with data\nfrom the JWST/Near-infrared Camera (NIRCam; Rieke et al. 2023)\nto investigate the presence of a UV bump in a galaxy at 𝑧= 7.11235.\nThis system is potentially undergoing a merger, allowing us to explore\nthe implications of these findings for dust formation in the early\nUniverse. This paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we discuss\nthe observations used in this work, in Section 3 we discuss our\nmethods and analysis, and we place these into the context of galaxy\nand dust formation in Section 4. Finally, our findings are summarised\nin Section 5. Throughout this paper, we assume a standard cosmology\nof 𝐻0 = 70 kms−1Mpc−1, Ω𝑚= 0.3, and ΩΛ = 0.7 and a solar\nabundance of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.69 (Asplund et al. 2021). All\nmagnitudes are quoted in the AB magnitude system (Oke & Gunn\n1983), and galaxy sizes refer to the half-light radius.\n2 OBSERVATIONS\nGNWY-7379420231, at 𝑧= 7.11235, was observed as part of\nthe NIRSpec Wide Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) Program\n(Maseda et al. 2024, henceforth referred to as Wide). The Wide sur-\nvey covers the five extragalactic deep fields of the Cosmic Assembly\nNear-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS; Gro-\ngin et al. 2011; Koekemoer et al. 2011) with 31 pointings, covering\n≈320 arcmin2 in 105 hours. As part of the high priority targets in the\nWide survey, IRAC-excess sources from Smit et al. (2015); Roberts-\nBorsani et al. (2016) are observed, i.e. galaxies at 𝑧= 6−8 with strong\noptical emission lines determined from Spitzer/IRAC photometry. At\nthe time of writing, the sample of IRAC-excess sources is made up\nof 23 galaxies, covering a redshift range of 𝑧= 5.66 −7.65. Through\nMNRAS 000, 1–16 (2025)\n\n\nThe 2175Å UV Bump in the EoR\n3\nvisual inspection of these sources, we identify the presence of a\nstrong UV bump in GNWY-7379420231 only. We show a tentative\nUV bump detection in EGSZ-9135048459, at 𝑧= 6.74, in Appendix\nA.\nGNWY-7379420231 was originally identified as a Lyman break\ncandidate at 𝑧phot = 8.29 in Bouwens et al. (2015), and identified\nas a Spitzer/IRAC-excess source in Roberts-Borsani et al. (2016).\nSubsequent Keck/MOSFIRE observations in Roberts-Borsani et al.\n(2023) revealed Ly-𝛼emission, confirming a spectroscopic redshift\nof 𝑧Ly𝛼= 7.10813 ± 0.00019.\n2.1 Spectroscopic Observations\nThe low-resolution spectrum was obtained using PRISM/CLEAR\n(PRISM hereafter), covering a wavelength range of 0.6𝜇m −5.3𝜇m\nat a spectral resolution of 𝑅≈100 (varying from 30−300 for a uni-\nformly illuminated shutter; Jakobsen et al. 2022). High-resolution\nspectra were obtained using the G235H and G395H gratings (and\nassociated F170LP and F290LP filters), providing wavelength cov-\nerage of 1.66𝜇m −3.05𝜇m and 2.78𝜇m −5.14𝜇m, respectively, at a\nspectral resolution of 𝑅≈2700.\nFor the PRISM spectrum, 1 exposure with 55 groups was taken,\nusing the NRSIRS2RAPID read-out mode (Rauscher et al. 2017)\nwith a 3-point nodding pattern to cycle through the 3 shutter-slitlet\nper target. This results in an effective exposure time of 2451 s. The\nhigh resolution gratings were nodded between the two outer shutter\npositions to minimise source self-subtraction in the 𝑧\n=\n1 −3\ngalaxies in Wide. For the G235H grating, 1 exposure with 55 groups\nwas taken for each of the two nodding positions (1634s total) and\nfor the G395H grating 1 exposure with 60 groups was taken (1780s\ntotal).\n2.2 NIRSpec Data Reduction\nWe use the same core reduction process as other NIRSpec Multi-\nObject Spectroscopy (MOS) GTO surveys (e.g., Curtis-Lake et al.\n2023; Cameron et al. 2023; Carniani et al. 2024; Bunker et al. 2024;\nSaxena et al. 2024) developed by the ESA NIRSpec Science Oper-\nations Team (SOT) and GTO teams, as described in Carniani et al.\n(2024). Most of the pipeline uses the same algorithms as the offi-\ncial Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) pipeline (Alves de\nOliveira et al. 2018; Ferruit et al. 2022), with small survey-specific\nmodifications (Maseda et al. 2024). We use a finer grid in wavelength\nwith regular steps in the 2D rectification process. We also estimate\npath losses for each source by taking the relative intra-shutter posi-\ntion into account and assuming a point-like morphology, as in Bunker\net al. (2024); Curti et al. (2024a). The Wide reduction differs from\nother GTO reductions in the sigma-clipping algorithm used to ex-\nclude outliers when creating the 1D spectrum, which does not work\nwell with a low number of exposures as in Wide, and does not ac-\ncount for Poisson noise from bright pixels, which is typical for many\nWide targets. Therefore, the reductions used in this work skip this\nstep.\n2.3 NIRCam Imaging\nWe use NIRCam imaging of the Great Observatories Origins Deep\nSurvey (Giavalisco et al. 2004) North (GOODS-N) field, obtained\nas part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES;\nEisenstein et al. 2023) from programme 1181 (PI: Eisenstein). Nine\nfilters in total are used within these observations: F090W, F115W,\nF150W, F200W, F277W, F335M, F356W, F410M and F444W. The\nreduction of these images closely follows the method used in Rieke\net al. (2023).\n2.4 Aperture Correction\nWe use NIRCam photometry extracted within Kron apertures with\nKron parameter equal to 1.2 (𝑅Kron,s) as high signal-to-noise esti-\nmates of flux in each filter band. For a galaxy with a Sérsic index of\n𝑛= 1, 𝑅Kron,s corresponds to the half-light radius (Graham & Driver\n2005). We use the Kron photometry extracted in apertures with Kron\nparameter equal to 2.5 (𝑅Kron) to determine the ratio 𝑅Kron/𝑅Kron,s\nin the F444W band to estimate the amount of flux missed by the\nsmaller apertures. We then correct all 𝑅Kron,s fluxes by this factor to\nobtain our final flux values.\nIn order to correct the spectrum to account for flux outside the slit,\nwe first derive synthetic photometry of the NIRSpec spectrum us-\ning the NIRCam filter curves. We then multiply the spectrum by the\nmedian ratio of the scaled 𝑅Kron,s photometry to the synthetic pho-\ntometry, excluding F090W where the source is not detected. The 1D\nand 2D spectra are shown in Figure 1 with the NIRCam photometry\nand filter curves.\n3 METHODS AND ANALYSIS\n3.1 Spectroscopic Redshift\nWe estimate the spectroscopic redshift with msaexp1 (Brammer\n2023) using eazy templates (Brammer et al. 2008), as in Maseda et al.\n(2024). From this, we obtain a spectroscopic redshift of 𝑧= 7.11235.\n3.2 UV Magnitudes and Slopes\nWe convert the JWST NIRCam F150W apparent magnitude (𝑚UV) to\ngive UV absolute magnitude (𝑀UV), which is reported in Table 1. We\nmodel the UV continuum slope of the galaxy considered here with a\npower law 𝐹𝜆∝𝜆𝛽. We measure this slope within the fitting windows\ndefined in Calzetti et al. (1994), excluding the windows redwards of\n1833Å to exclude the UV bump region and the Ciii]𝜆𝜆1907, 1909\ndoublet (Ciii]). We include a fitting window at 2580 −2640Å to\nreduce the uncertainty on the fit.\nWe use a Bayesian fitting procedure to fit the rest-frame UV con-\ntinuum using a python implementation of the multinest nested\nsampling algorithm (Feroz et al. 2009), pymultinest (Buchner et al.\n2014). We use a Gaussian prior distribution for the power-law index,\ncentred on 𝜇𝛽= −2, with a standard deviation of 𝜎𝛽= 0.5, and a\nflat prior on the normalisation at 𝜆rest = 1500Å (between 0 and twice\nthe maximum flux value of the spectrum in the fitting regions). The\nbest-fit value of 𝛽is given by the 50th percentile (median) of the\nposterior distribution, with the 16th and 84th percentiles given as a\n±1𝜎confidence range. The UV slope fit is shown in Figure 2.\n3.3 UV Bump Identification\nTo determine the robustness of the UV bump feature, we follow the\nmethod defined in Witstok et al. (2023). We fit power laws in four\nadjacent wavelength windows defined by Noll et al. (2007), with\npower-law indices 𝛾1 to 𝛾4. While the 𝛾3 region begins at 1920Å in\n1 https://github.com/gbrammer/msaexp\nMNRAS 000, 1–16 (2025)\n\n\n4\nK.

The\nlocation of the 2175Å UV bump is shown by the dashed red vertical line, and the locations of key emission lines are shown by dashed grey lines. The transmission\ncurves for each photometric filter used are also shown. The inset panel shows a PSF-matched RGB image of GNWY-7379420231 (R: F444W, G: F200W, B:\nF150W) with the location of the NIRSpec slitlets outlined in solid white lines.\nNoll et al. (2007), we exclude the region 1920Å < 𝜆emit <1950Å to\nensure we avoid contamination from the Ciii] doublet. The parameter\n𝛾34 ≡𝛾3 −𝛾4 is used to identify the presence of the absorption\nfeature centred on 2175Å, where a more prominent UV bump being\npresent results in a more negative value of 𝛾34 (Noll et al. 2009).\nPrior to fitting the wavelength windows, the spectrum is smoothed\nwith a running median filter of 15 pixels. The uncertainty of the\nrunning median is estimated with a bootstrapping procedure, where\neach of the 15 pixels is randomly perturbed according to their formal\nuncertainty for 100 iterations.\nWe choose flat prior distributions for the power law indices within\nthe range −10 < 𝛾𝑖< 1, and normalise at the centre of each wave-\nlength window, between 0 and twice the maximum value of the flux\nin each fitting region. The best-fit value of 𝛾34 is given by the median\nof the posterior distribution obtained by simultaneously fitting 𝛾3\nand 𝛾4, with the 16th and 84th percentiles given as a ±1𝜎confidence\nrange.\n3.4 UV Bump Fitting\nAs in Witstok et al. (2023), we parameterise the UV bump\nprofile\nby\ndefining\nthe\nexcess\nattenuation\nas\n𝐴𝜆, bump\n=\n−2.5 log10\n\u0000𝐹𝜆/𝐹𝜆, cont\n\u0001, where 𝐹𝜆is the observed flux, and 𝐹𝜆, cont\nis the UV continuum slope, without a UV bump (Shivaei et al. 2022).\nWe use the running median and its corresponding uncertainty (see\nSection 3.3) to compute the significance of the negative flux ex-\ncess of the spectrum with respect to the power-law UV slope (𝛽UV),\ndetermined in Section 3.2.\nWe use the multinest nested sampling algorithm to fit the excess\nattenuation 𝐴𝜆, bump with a Drude profile (Fitzpatrick & Massa\n1986). Centred on rest-frame wavelength 𝜆max, this is defined as\n𝐴𝜆, bump = 𝐴𝜆,max\n𝛾2/𝜆2\n\u0010\n1/𝜆2 −1/𝜆2max\n\u00112\n+ 𝛾2/𝜆2\n(1)\nwhere the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is given by FWHM=\n𝛾𝜆2max. We fix 𝛾= 250Å/(2175Å)2 which corresponds to FWHM=\n250Å if 𝜆max = 2175Å, in agreement with findings for 𝑧∼2 star-\nforming galaxies (Noll et al. 2009; Shivaei et al. 2022). We note that\nallowing the FWHM to vary does not affect the other parameters.\nMNRAS 000, 1–16 (2025)\n\n\nThe 2175Å UV Bump in the EoR\n5\nWe carry out the fitting procedure in a region of 1950Å < 𝜆emit <\n2580Å, which includes the 𝛾3 and 𝛾4 regions, but excludes the Ciii]\ndoublet. We use a gamma distribution with shape parameter 𝑎= 1\nand scale 𝜃= 0.2 as a prior for bump amplitude, 𝐴𝜆,max. This favours\nthe lowest amplitudes, although a flat prior gives comparable results.\nWe use a flat prior for the central wavelength in the range 2100Å\n< 𝜆max < 2300Å. The UV bump fit is shown in Figure 2, with best-\nfit values listed in Table 1. We compare this model to a simple power-\nlaw using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The significantly\nlower BIC value for the UV bump model (ΔBIC = 66.7) indicates\nthat this model is preferred over a simple power-law model.\n3.5 SED Fitting\nWe model the SED of GNWY-7379420231 using bagpipes (Bayesian\nAnalysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStima-\ntion; Carnall et al. 2018, 2019), fitting both the photometry and\nspectroscopy simultaneously. We use Binary Population and Spec-\ntral Synthesis (bpass) v2.2.1 models (Stanway & Eldridge 2018),\nwith models that include binary stars. We use the default bpass initial\nmass function \"135_300\" (IMF; stellar mass from 0.1M⊙to 300M⊙\nand a slope of −2.35 for 𝑀> 0.5M⊙). We mask the region around\nLy𝛼(1200 Å < 𝜆emit < 1250 Å) to mitigate any potential effects\nfrom Lyman-𝛼damping-wing absorption. We also mask the region\n4900 Å < 𝜆emit < 5100 Å in the spectrum due to small discrepan-\ncies between the [Oiii] equivalent widths (EW) in the spectroscopy\nand photometry. While bagpipes can account for small wavelength-\ndependent variations between the spectroscopy and photometry, it is\nnot flexible enough to solve for emission line discrepancies.\nWe assume a non-parametric star formation history (SFH) from\nLeja et al. (2019), which fits the star formation rates in fixed time bins,\nwhere ΔlogSFR between bins is linked by a Student’s t-distribution.\nAs in Tacchella et al. (2022), we fit a ‘continuity’ model, with 𝜎=\n0.3 and 𝜈= 2, which is weighted against rapid transitions in star\nformation rate, and a ‘bursty continuity’ model with 𝜎= 1 and\n𝜈= 2, which allows more variation in star formation rate (SFR) (i.e.,\na more bursty star formation history). We fix the redshift of the galaxy\nto 𝑧= 7.11235, and fit the SFH in 6 bins of lookback time 𝑡, with the\nfirst bins fixed to 0 Myr < t < 3 Myr and 3 Myr < t < 10 Myr, and the\nremaining 4 bins equally log-spaced in lookback time until 𝑡(𝑧= 20).\nWe note that the inferred SFH is largely insensitive to the number\nof bins used as long as 𝑁bins ≥4 (Leja et al. 2019). We favour the\n‘bursty continuity’ model as this flexible SFH accommodates both\nstochastic star formation and underlying older stellar populations.\nIt should be noted that this model still allows smooth or declining\nSFHs if favoured during the fitting (see Harvey et al. 2025). We\nreduce the star formation timescale to 10 Myr to account for the\nincreased specific star formation rate (sSFR), compared to galaxies\nat lower redshift.\nThe allowed total stellar mass formed and stellar metallicities are\nallowed to vary uniformly between 105 M⊙< M★< 1012 M⊙, and\n0 < 𝑍∗< 0.5 Z⊙, respectively. Nebular emission is included using\na grid of cloudy (Ferland et al. 2017) models, parameterised by\nthe ionisation parameter (−3 < log10U < −0.5), which bagpipes\ncomputes self-consistently. We use the Salim et al. (2018) dust at-\ntenuation curve, which parameterises the dust curve shape with a\npower-law deviation 𝛿from the Calzetti et al. (2000) model (𝛿= 0\nfor the Calzetti curve) and includes a Drude profile to model the\n2175Å bump. The strength of the bump is given by the amplitude 𝐵,\nin units of 𝐴bump /𝐸(𝐵−𝑉) where 𝐴bump is the extra attenuation\nat 2175Å. We keep the central wavelength and width of the bump\nfixed at 2175Å and 250Å, respectively. We use uniform priors for 𝛿\n(−0.5 < 𝛿< 0.2) and 𝐵(0 < 𝐵< 10), and a Gaussian prior on the\nV-band dust attenuation with 𝜇𝐴𝑉= 0.15 mag, 𝜎𝐴𝑉= 0.15 mag and\nattenuation limited to 0 < 𝐴𝑉< 7 mag, fixing the fraction of atten-\nuation arising from stellar birth clouds to 60%, with the remaining\n40% coming from the diffuse ISM (Chevallard et al. 2019). We also\nassume a log-prior on the velocity dispersion in the range 1 −1000\nkm s−1. Finally, we assume that the spectrum follows the PRISM\nresolution curve based on a point-source morphology, using the res-\nolution curve of an idealised point source generated with msafit, as\ndescribed in de Graaff et al. (2024b, Appendix A).\nWe carry out further bagpipes fits, varying only the assumed dust\nattenuation curve. We perform fits with the Milky Way dust curve,\nthe Salim dust law with 𝐵fixed as 0 (henceforth referred to as the\nflat Salim curve), allowing only the slope (𝛿) to deviate from the\nCalzetti curve, and the Li et al. (2008) analytical expression for the\ndust attenuation law, used in Markov et al. (2023, 2024). This dust\nparameterisation has the benefit of allowing SED fitting to be carried\nout without assuming the prior shape of the dust curve, but has the\ndisadvantage of having four free parameters, thus should only be used\nwith spectroscopic data, or photometric surveys with a sufficiently\nlarge number of photometric bands (Markov et al. 2023). We modify\nthe expression to allow for a variable width of the Drude profile\ncharacterising the UV bump, and as such the dust curve, normalised\nto the attenuation at 0.55𝜇m (𝐴𝑉), is given by\n𝐴𝜆/𝐴𝑉=\n𝑐1\n(𝜆/0.08)𝑐2 + (0.08/𝜆)𝑐2 + 𝑐3\n+ 233 [1 −𝑐1/(6.88𝑐2 + 0.145𝑐2 + 𝑐3) −𝑐4/𝑥]\n(𝜆/0.046)2 + (0.046/𝜆)2 + 90\n+\n𝑐4\n(𝜆/0.2175)2 + (0.2175/𝜆)2 +\n\u0002\n(𝑤/0.2175)2 −2\n\u0003 ,\n(2)\nwhere 𝑐1, 𝑐2, 𝑐3, 𝑐4 are dimensionless parameters, 𝜆is the wave-\nlength in 𝜇m, 𝑥= (6.55 +\n\u0002\n(𝑤/0.2175)2 −2\n\u0003\n), and 𝑤is the width\nof the UV bump in 𝜇m. The three terms of equation (2) describe the\nfar-ultraviolet (FUV) rise, the optical and near-infrared (NIR) atten-\nuation, and the 2175Å UV bump. We use priors for 𝑐1 −𝑐4 adapted\nfrom those given in Markov et al. (2024), requiring 𝑐4 ≥0, and set\n𝑤= 0.0250𝜇m. We present the best-fit values obtained with each\ndust curve, along with 1𝜎errors in Table 2. The posterior spectra\nand dust curves are shown in Figure 3. We show the full posterior\nspectra with residuals in Figure B1.\nWe find that fitting the photometry or spectrum alone recovers\nsimilar parameters for the UV bump (see Figure B2).\n3.6 Morphology\nWe perform surface brightness fitting with galfit version 3.0.5 (Peng\net al. 2002, 2010) to investigate the morphology of our source. galfit\nconvolves the galaxy surface brightness profile with a point spread\nfunction (PSF), and uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to min-\nimise the 𝜒2 of the fit.\nWe create PSF matched images using aperpy 2 (Weaver et al.\n2024), which creates empirical PSFs and makes use of pypher (Bou-\ncaud et al. 2016) to create PSF matched kernels. We create a PSF\nmatched stack of the filters in the short wavelength (SW) channel\nwhere the source is detected (F115W, F150W, F200W) to determine\nthe components required for fitting.\n2 aperpy is available though Github (https://github.com/astrowhit/\naperpy) and Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8280270).\nMNRAS 000, 1–16 (2025)\n\n\n6\nK.

Spectrum of GNWY-7379420231 (grey solid line) with a power-law fit to the UV continuum (red solid line). The dark red shading represents the UV\nslope fitting windows. The zoom in panel of the region around 2175Å shows the running median, indicated by a solid black line. This represents the attenuated\nstellar continuum, and shows a localised absorption feature. The Drude profile fit is shown by the solid blue line, within the fitting window indicated by the\nvertical dashed lines. The hatched region shows the location of the Ciii doublet. The bottom right panel shows the residuals of the power-law fit (PL) and\nthe combined power-law and Drude profile fit (PL+Drude). The power-law fit alone has a 7.0𝜎negative flux excess, with the PL+Drude model showing a\nsignificantly better fit, as supported by the BIC values.\nWe fit the source using two Sérsic components and a point source.\nThe Sérsic profile has the form\n𝐼(𝑅) = 𝐼𝑒exp\n(\n−𝑏𝑛\n\"\u0012 𝑅\n𝑅𝑒\n\u00131/𝑛\n−1\n#)\n,\n(3)\nwhere 𝐼(𝑅) is the intensity at a distance 𝑅from the centre of the\ngalaxy, 𝑅𝑒is the half-light radius of galaxy, 𝐼𝑒is the intensity at\nthe half-light radius, 𝑛is the Sérsic index (Sérsic 1963; Ciotti 1991;\nCaon et al. 1993), and 𝑏𝑛can be approximated as 𝑏𝑛≈2𝑛−1\n3 +\n4\n405𝑛+\n46\n25515𝑛2 (Ciotti & Bertin 1999). We allow 𝑅𝑒, magnitude, axis\nratio (𝑏/𝑎) and position angle to vary freely, allow the Sérsic index\nto vary between 0 < 𝑛< 10, and allow the source position to vary\nwithin ±3 pixels of the input location in both the 𝑥and 𝑦direction.\nWe find that one component has a very low Sérsic index, which we\nfix as 𝑛= 0.2. The best-fit model for the SW stack is shown in\nFigure 4. We then fit each band individually, keeping all parameters\nfixed to the best-fit values while allowing only the magnitude to vary.\nThe best-fit models are shown in Figure C1, where the point source\ncomponent is particularly visible in the SW channels.\nThe best-fit model is made up of a main, brighter component\n(Sérsic 1), with a ‘tail’, made up of the secondary Sérsic component\n(Sérsic 2) and a point source. The bright region (Sérsic 1) is best-fit\nby a Sérsic profile with 𝑛= 6.04 ± 2.27, and has a half-light radius\nof 𝑅𝑒= 569 ± 170 pc. The fainter Sérsic component (Sérsic 2) is the\ncomponent that is fit with a fixed Sérsic index of 𝑛= 0.20, and has a\nhalf-light radius of 𝑅𝑒= 648±80 pc. Errors are the 1𝜎uncertainties\nderived by galfit.\nWe carry out photometric SED fitting for each of these three\ncomponents, with the magnitudes obtained from the galfit fit in\neach band. As in Section 3.5, we use bpass v2.2.1 models with the\ndefault bpass IMF. We keep the redshift of the source fixed and use a\n‘bursty continuity’ model of star formation history, with bins of 0−3\nMyr, 3−10 Myr, 10−30 Myr and 30−𝑡(𝑧= 20) Myr. The ionisation\nparameter and metallicity are fixed to the best fit values obtained with\nthe Salim dust law in Section 3.5. We use the Salim dust law where\nthe prior on 𝐵is a truncated Gaussian prior with 𝜇𝐵= 0, 𝜎𝐵= 2,\nand 0 < 𝐵< 10. The best-fit spectra and photometry are shown in\nFigure 5, along with the posterior SFHs.\nFinally, we use statmorph (Rodriguez-Gomez et al. 2019) to\nmeasure the Gini-𝑀20 statistics, which can be used to quantify galaxy\nmorphology (Lotz et al. 2004, 2008). The Gini coefficient (𝐺) is a\nstatistic that is commonly used in economics to measure wealth\ndistribution in human populations, but was first used by Abraham\net al. (2003) to provide a quantitative measure of the distribution of\nlight within a galaxy. 𝐺is determined from the distribution of the\nabsolute flux values:\n𝐺=\n1\n|𝑋|𝑛(𝑛−1)\n𝑛\n∑︁\n𝑖\n(2𝑖−𝑛−1) |𝑋𝑖| ,\n(4)\nwhere |𝑋| is the mean of the absolute values |𝑋𝑖| (Lotz et al. 2004;\nRodriguez-Gomez et al. 2019). The 𝑀20 statistic is defined as the\nMNRAS 000, 1–16 (2025)\n\n\nThe 2175Å UV Bump in the EoR\n7\n10000\n15000\n20000\n25000\n30000\nObserved Wavelength (˚A)\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1.25\n1.50\n1.75\n2.00\nFν (10−30 erg s−1 cm−2 Hz−1)\nPRISM Spectrum\nRunning Median\nMW\nSalim\nFlat\nLi\nNIRCam Photometry\nbagpipes Photometry\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\nRest-frame Wavelength (˚A)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nAλ/AV\nCalzetti\nSMC\nMW\nThis work (Flat)\nThis work (Li)\nThis work (Salim)\nFigure 3.

Ormerod et al.\net al. 2004, 2008). We show the location of GNWY-7379420231 on\nthe Gini-𝑀20 parameter space in Figure C2, adopting the classifica-\ntions from Lotz et al. (2008). Gini and 𝑀20 can be used to determine\nwhether a galaxy is a merger, if the following criterion is met:\n𝐺> −0.14𝑀20 + 0.33.\n(7)\nBased on these diagnostics, GNWY-7379420231 falls within the\nmerger region of the parameter space. The stellar mass ratio of 12:1\nbetween Sérsic 1 and the two other components, derived from bag-\npipes spectral fitting, classifies this system as a minor merger. We\nalso see evidence for a minor merger in the G395H 2D spectrum of\nthe [Oiii] doublet, with a velocity offset of ∼180 kms−1, shown in\nFigure C3.\n3.7 Resolved SED Fitting\nWe create PSF matched images following the same method used in\nSection 3.6. We choose to match to the F444W mosaic as this has the\nbroadest PSF of our filters. We create an inverse variance weighted\nstacked image of our source and use vorbin (Cappellari & Copin\n2003) to perform adaptive spatial noise binning to create bins with\na target signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 25. We extract photometry\nin each NIRCam filter for each bin, and model the SED of each bin\nusing bagpipes.\nWe apply the same bagpipes fitting procedure described in Section\n3.6. We again adopt the Salim dust law with a truncated Gaussian\nprior on 𝐵(𝜇𝐵= 0, 𝜎𝐵= 2, 0 < 𝐵< 10) to allow us to trace the\nlocation of the UV bump. Using the 50th percentile of the posterior\nbagpipes distributions, we create 2D maps of the physical properties\nof our source, as shown in Figure 6. We measure the [Oiii]+H𝛽\nrest-frame equivalent width from the 50th percentile of the posterior\nspectrum generated in the fitting process, and measure the UV 𝛽\nslopes using the same fitting windows as in Section 3.2.\n3.8 Emission Line Measurements\nWe perform emission line fitting that accounts for both the line spread\nfunction (LSF) broadening and its undersampling by the NIRSpec\ndetectors. It is important that this is accounted for, as fitting a Gaus-\nsian to an undersampled line could severely over or underestimate the\nline flux (de Graaff et al. 2024a). To address this, we create Gaussian\nmodels on an oversampled grid and convolve them with the LSF of\nan idealised point source from de Graaff et al. (2024b). We use the\nmultinest nested sampling algorithm to fit the emission lines in both\nthe PRISM and G395H spectra.\nWe fit the following emission lines in the PRISM spectrum:\n[Oii]𝜆3727, [Oii]𝜆3729, H𝛽, [Oiii]𝜆4959 and [Oiii]𝜆5007. Due\nto the resolution of the PRISM spectrum, we fit the blended\n[Oii]𝜆3727+ [Oii]𝜆3729 emission lines as a single Gaussian. To re-\nduce the number of free parameters, we fix the central wavelength of\neach Gaussian profile, and fix the flux ratio of the [Oiii]𝜆𝜆4959, 5007\ndoublet to the theoretical value of 2.98. Finally, we correct for dust\nattenuation with the Cardelli et al. (1989) curve.\nThe dust corrected emission line fluxes are reported in Table D1 as\nthe median of the posterior flux distribution, with errors given as the\nsemi-difference of the 16th-84th percentiles of the posterior distri-\nbution. Using these emission lines, we derive the oxygen abundance\n(12 + log(O/H)) from a range of emission line ratios:\nR2 = log\n\u0012 [Oii]𝜆𝜆3727, 3729\nH𝛽\n\u0013\n(8)\nO32 = log\n\u0012\n[Oiii]𝜆5007\n[Oii]𝜆𝜆3727, 3729\n\u0013\n(9)\nR3 = log\n\u0012 [Oiii]𝜆5007\nH𝛽\n\u0013\n(10)\nR23 = log\n\u0012 [Oii]𝜆𝜆3727, 3729 + [Oiii]𝜆𝜆4959, 5007\nH𝛽\n\u0013\n(11)\nˆ𝑅= 0.47 × R2 + 0.88 × R3.\n(12)\nFigure 7 shows the dust corrected O32 and R23 emission line\nratios. The dust corrected emission line ratios are reported in\nfull in Table 1, along with the rest-frame equivalent width of the\n[Oiii]𝜆𝜆4959, 5007 doublet and H𝛽line. We combine the informa-\ntion from the emission line ratios and use the calibrations from Curti\net al. (2024b) to calculate the gas-phase metallicity (𝑍neb) in units of\nsolar metallicity (𝑍⊙), which is given in Table 1.\nUsing the\n𝑅\n∼\n2700 G395H grating, we measure the\n[Oii]𝜆𝜆3727,3729 and [Oiii]𝜆𝜆4959,5007 emission lines. We first\nmeasure the [Oiii] doublet with tied line widths. We use the median\nwidth of the posterior distribution as a fixed width when fitting the\n[Oii] doublet, where we also keep the central wavelengths fixed. The\n[Oii] fit is shown in Figure D1.\n3.9 Electron Density Measurement\nElectron densities in Hii regions are crucial for characterising the\nISM, as along with ISM pressure, they govern the emission from Hii\nregions (e.g. Kewley et al. 2019b; Isobe et al. 2023; Abdurro’uf et al.\n2024). To derive the electron density, we utilise the density-sensitive\n[Oii]𝜆3726,𝜆𝜆3729 emission line ratio (Kewley et al. 2019a), mea-\nsured from the G395H grating.\nWe then use pyneb (Luridiana et al. 2015) to determine 𝑛𝑒from the\n[Oii] line ratio, assuming an electron temperature of 𝑇𝑒= 10000K.\nFrom this, we obtain a value of log10(𝑛𝑒) cm−1 = 3.12+0.83\n−0.47, in\nagreement with the median value determined in Isobe et al. (2023)\nfor 𝑧∼7 −9 galaxies.\n3.10 Dynamical Mass\nWe follow the method described in Kohandel et al. (2019) to estimate\nthe dynamical mass of our source, which we summarise here. As-\nsuming a rotating disk geometry with radius 𝑅, the dynamical mass\ncan be estimated as\n𝑀dyn = 𝑣2𝑐𝑅\n𝐺,\n(13)\nwhere 𝑣𝑐can be estimated from the FWHM of the [Oiii]𝜆5007\nemission line using\nFWHM = 𝛾𝑣𝑐sin𝜃,\n(14)\nwhere 𝛾is a factor dependent on geometry, line profile, and turbu-\nlence. As in Capak et al. (2015), we estimate 𝛾= 1.32 and addi-\ntionally include a systematic error on 𝛾of 20%. We determine the\ninclination (𝜃) from the axis ratio of Sérsic 1 measured in Section\n3.6 using the Hubble (1926) equation\ncos2(𝜃) =\n(𝑏/𝑎)2 −(𝑏/𝑎)2\nmin\n1 −(𝑏/𝑎)2\nmin\n,\n(15)\nMNRAS 000, 1–16 (2025)\n\n\nThe 2175Å UV Bump in the EoR\n9\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\nRest-frame Wavelength (˚A)\n10000\n20000\n30000\n40000\n50000\nObserved Wavelength (˚A)\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\nAB Magnitude\ngalfit Photometry\nbagpipes Photometry\ngalfit Photometry\nbagpipes Photometry\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16 1820\nRedshift (z)\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\nAge of Universe (Gyr)\n0\n2\n4\nSFR (M⊙yr−1)\nS´ersic 1 - Main source\nlog10(M⋆/M⊙) = 8.37+0.08\n−0.11\nAV = 0.18+0.09\n−0.08 mag\nt⋆= 252+20\n−46 Myr\nSFR10 = 2.21+1.14\n−0.57 M⊙yr−1\nS´ersic 2 - Tail\nlog10(M⋆/M⊙) = 7.08+0.05\n−0.06\nAV = 0.29+0.07\n−0.08 mag\nt⋆= 3+15\n−1\nMyr\nSFR10 = 1.18+0.14\n−0.14 M⊙yr−1\nPoint source - Tail\nlog10(M⋆/M⊙) = 6.84+0.43\n−0.25\nAV = 0.31+0.08\n−0.06 mag\nt⋆= 56+169\n−53\nMyr\nSFR10 = 0.41+0.15\n−0.08 M⊙yr−1\nFigure 5.

From the integrated PRISM spectrum of our\nsource, we measure a high [Oiii]+H𝛽rest-frame equivalent width\nof 1300 ± 210Å, placing GNWY-7379420231 within the extreme\nemission line galaxy (EELG) regime (e.g., Boyett et al. 2024). The\n[Oiii]+H𝛽emission is a tracer of ongoing star formation, indicating\nthe presence of a young stellar population. This is in agreement with\nthe inferred mass-weighted ages (22 −59 Myr) from the combined\nspectro-photometric SED fitting, when a UV bump is included in the\nattenuation curve (see Table 2). We also measure the dust-corrected\nemission line ratios O32 and R23, which are shown in Figure 7. Our\nsource falls within the red shaded region defined in Witten et al.\n(2025), which indicates the region in the log10(O32) −log10(R23)\nparameter space that may be populated by galaxies containing an\nolder stellar population. However, in galaxies with strong emission\nlines, the light from recent starbursts can dominate that of older stel-\nlar populations in an effect known as ‘outshining’ (Narayanan et al.\n2024b). Due to the presence of extreme emission lines in the inte-\ngrated spectrum, we investigate whether an older stellar population\nis present through both resolved SED fitting in Voronoi bins, and the\nSED fitting of the galfit components.\nThrough morphological analysis we are able to separate the source\ninto three components: the main component (Sérsic 1) which contains\nthe bulk of the stellar mass, and a tail made up of a second Sérsic\ncomponent (Sérsic 2) and a point source. The inferred mass-weighted\nages from the SED fitting of these components suggests that the\nmain component is significantly older, with 𝑡★∼252 Myr for the\nmain component, compared to 𝑡★∼56 Myr and 𝑡★∼3 Myr for\nthe components within the tail. This indicates that an older stellar\npopulation is indeed present within GNWY-7379420231, despite\nthe extreme emission lines dominating the integrated spectrum. The\nbest-fit posterior spectra are shown in Figure 5, with the UV bump\nfeature strongest in the point source component of the tail.\nWe show maps of the physical properties inferred from the re-\nsolved SED fitting in Figure 6, and UV continuum slopes measured\nfrom the median bagpipes posterior spectra. The overlaid contours\nfrom the SW stack show the clumpy nature of the galaxy, with a\nmain component and an extended tail-like feature. Although clumpy\nmorphologies are common within the EoR (Chen et al. 2024), the dis-\nsimilar star formation histories of each component suggest that this\nmay be a merger system (e.g., Hsiao et al. 2023). Furthermore, this\nhypothesis is supported by the detection of a tail-like feature (e.g. Ren\net al. 2020). The regions with the highest [Oiii]+H𝛽EWs (> 2500Å)\nare concentrated within the area where the tail and main compo-\nnent are merging, indicating that the starburst is merger-induced.\nThe mass-weighted ages inferred by the SED fitting for this region of\nextreme line emission are very young (≲20 Myr), further supporting\nthe idea of a recent burst of star formation. The stellar mass surface\ndensity (Σ★) map shows that the bulk of the stellar mass is concen-\ntrated within the main component of the source. This could suggest\nthe presence of an older stellar population in this region where stellar\nmass has built up over time. Although the Σ★and star formation rate\nsurface density (ΣSFR10) overlap significantly, there is a slight offset\nbetween the well localised peaks of the ΣSFR10 and Σ★, with the peak\nΣSFR10 slightly closer to the merger region. Through the maps of the\nUV slope and 𝐴𝑉, we can see that the dust attenuation is patchy, with\nsome significantly dustier sightlines present. The location of these\ndustier sightlines suggests that there is significant dust build up lo-\ncalised to the merger region. The bump strength (𝐵) parameter from\nthe Salim dust curve is a measure of the additional dust attenuation\nat 2175Å and peaks where the tail and main component are merging,\nwithin the region of extreme line emission where a recent burst of\nstar formation took place. Note that we aim to be conservative in our\nresolved bump fitting by adding a prior on 𝐵centred on 𝐵= 0 (see\nSections 3.6 and 3.7). While our photometric analysis provides an\ninitial insight into this spatial distribution, we note that observations\nwith the NIRSpec IFU would be valuable to explore these findings\nin greater detail.\nThere are two possible scenarios which may give rise to the vis-\nibility of the UV bump in the tail region of our galaxy. Firstly, an\nolder stellar population may have enriched this region over time. The\ntotal stellar mass formed > 300 Myr ago within the main Sérsic\ncomponent (Sérsic 1) is log10(𝑀★/𝑀⊙) = 7.96+0.12\n−0.21. It is possible\nthat AGB stars from this epoch could have contributed to the build\nup of carbonaceous dust grains, thus contributing to the presence of\nthe UV bump feature. In this case, the likely merger would illumi-\nnate existing dust. Alternatively, the merger-induced starburst could\nhave processed early-formed dust, breaking down larger dust grains\nformed in SNe, into smaller carbonaceous particles responsible for\nthe UV bump (see Section 4.4).\nWe explore the ISM properties of GNWY-7379420231 with the\nhigh-resolution G395H spectrum, dominated by emission from the\nmerger region of the galaxy, which we use to estimate the electron\ndensity. While the obtained value is high compared to estimates\nbased on the O32 emission line ratio (Reddy et al. 2023), and ele-\nvated compared to galaxies at lower redshift (e.g. 𝑛𝑒∼100cm−3,\nKaasinen et al. 2017), it is in agreement with the values obtained for\ngalaxies at a similar redshift in Isobe et al. (2023). The high electron\ndensity (log10(𝑛𝑒) cm−1 = 3.12+0.83\n−0.47) may be connected with gas\ncompression as a result of the merger, potentially inducing the recent\nburst of star formation. Finally, we estimate the dynamical mass of\nour galaxy, finding a stellar mass fraction of around ∼18%, suggest-\ning a gas dominated system. The gas supplied by the merger would\nbe required to fuel the strong burst of star formation. However, it\nmust be noted that dynamical masses may be under or overestimated\nin case of a merger (Kohandel et al. 2019; de Graaff et al. 2024b).\nFinally, GNWY-7379420231 is kinematically coincident with two\noverdensities (JADES-GN-OD-7.133, JADES-GN-OD-7.144) iden-\ntified in Helton et al. (2024), which reside in a complex environment\nwith connected filamentary structures. Furthermore, there is evi-\ndence of accelerated galaxy evolution in protocluster environments\n(Morishita et al. 2024), suggesting that the large scale environment\nin which GNWY-7379420231 resides could influence its evolution,\ncontributing to rapid dust formation.\nMNRAS 000, 1–16 (2025)\n\n\nThe 2175Å UV Bump in the EoR\n11\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1.25\n1.50\nlog10(R23)\n−0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nlog10(O32)\nHeintz+24 (z > 7)\nYang+17b Blueberries\nYang+17a Green Peas\nCameron+23\nWitten+24\nThis work\nFigure 7.

The red shading shows the region log10 O32 < 0.7\nand log10 R23 > 0.9 which may contain galaxies hosting an older stellar\npopulation (Witten et al. 2025).\n4.2 Dust Attenuation Curves\nThe dust attenuation curve assumed during SED fitting can introduce\nsystematic biases, with properties such as stellar mass, SFR, and 𝐴𝑉\nvarying significantly (Kriek & Conroy 2013; Salim & Narayanan\n2020). Previous studies have shown that stellar masses and SFRs\nmay vary by up to 0.16 dex and 0.3 dex, respectively (Reddy et al.\n2015; Narayanan et al. 2018; Tress et al. 2018; Shivaei et al. 2020),\nindicating that care must be taken when carrying out SED fitting. In\nthis section, we explore the impact of four different dust attenuation\ncurves, three of which incorporate a UV bump.\nWe find that the inferred metallicity (𝑍★) and ionisation parameter\n(log10𝑈) are consistent regardless of the dust law assumed during\nSED fitting, in agreement with Markov et al. (2023). While the\nmedian mass-weighted age, 𝑡★, varies from 22 −166 Myr, the large\nuncertainties associated with these inferred values have large overlap,\nsuggesting the ages are broadly consistent regardless of the assumed\ndust law. However, we find that the stellar mass, log10 (𝑀★/𝑀⊙),\ndoes vary depending on the assumed dust law. Adopting the flat\nSalim dust law gives rise to a higher stellar mass (log10 (𝑀∗/𝑀⊙) =\n8.84+0.13\n−0.15, compared to log10 (𝑀∗/𝑀⊙) = 8.60+0.15\n−0.13 when assuming\nthe standard Salim dust law). This contrasts with the consistent values\ninferred when adopting a dust curve which exhibits a UV bump.\nThe SFRs and V-band dust attenuation also vary, with the use of\nthe Li parameterisation resulting in higher inferred values for both\nquantities.\nThe dust attenuation curves obtained from the bagpipes fitting are\nshown in Figure 3, along with the commonly used Calzetti, MW,\nand SMC curves. We find that the dust curve obtained using the\nSalim et al. (2018) curve is similar to the MW dust curve within 1𝜎\nerrors, with a strong UV bump at 2175Å, with a bump strength of\n𝐵= 4.08+1.42\n1.08 and a power-law modification of 𝛿= −0.11+0.13\n−0.16. The\ndust curve obtained with the Li parameterisation most resembles the\nshape of the MW curve with the presence of the UV bump, compared\nto other curves such as the Calzetti and SMC curves.

We measure a central\nwavelength of 𝜆max = 2257+26\n−28Å, similar to the 𝜆max = 2263+20\n−24Å\nmeasured in Witstok et al. (2023). This is ∼2.9𝜎higher than the\nMNRAS 000, 1–16 (2025)\n\n\n12\nK. Ormerod et al.\npeak wavelength seen in the MW curve, and may be caused by dust\ngrains with larger molecular size (Blasberger et al. 2017; Li et al.\n2024; Lin et al. 2025).\nWe measure a bump amplitude (strength) of 𝐴𝜆,max = 0.46+0.06\n−0.07\nmag, which we plot against cosmic time in Figure 8, along with other\nhigh redshift detections (Witstok et al. 2023; Markov et al. 2023),\n𝑧∼2 stacks (Shivaei et al. 2022; Noll et al. 2009), and the MW, LMC\nand SMC extinction curves (Fitzpatrick & Massa 1986; Gordon et al.\n2003). While the bump amplitudes in this work and Shivaei et al.\n(2022); Witstok et al. (2023) are measured in the same way, we must\nconvert the other literature points to a consistent definition of 𝐴𝜆,max.\nWe first convert the MW, LMC and SMC curves using the Fitzpatrick\n& Massa (1986) definition 𝐴𝜆,max = 𝑐3/𝛾2𝐸(𝐵−𝑉), where we vary\n𝐸(𝐵−𝑉) = 𝐴𝑉/𝑅𝑉over a range 0.1 mag < 𝐴𝑉< 0.5 mag.\nWe convert the Noll et al. (2009) values in the same way, with the\nmeasured values of 𝐸(𝐵−𝑉). We convert the Markov et al. (2023)\nvalue by measuring the excess attenuation using their quoted values of\n𝑐1 to 𝑐4 and the Li et al. (2008) dust attenuation expression as defined\nin their Equation 6, compared to the baseline attenuation determined\nby setting 𝑐4 = 0. Finally, we download the spectra of the two sources\nidentified in Markov et al. (2024) with a bump detection from the\nDAWN JWST Archive (DJA; Heintz et al. 2024b), which are reduced\nwith msaexp (Brammer 2023; de Graaff et al. 2024a) to measure the\nbump strength and central wavelength, following the same procedure\nas in Section 2. We measure bump amplitudes for 2750_449 and\n1433_3989 of 𝐴𝜆,max = 0.44+0.07\n−0.08 mag and 𝐴𝜆,max = 0.32 ± 0.07\nmag, respectively.\nIt is expected that the strength of the UV bump decreases towards\nhigher redshift (Markov et al. 2024), however the bump amplitude\nmeasured in this work is high and in contrast to this expected trend.\nInterestingly, it is similar to the 𝑧∼6.7 detection in Witstok et al.\n(2023) and values we measure for the two galaxies from Markov\net al. (2024). Combined with the increased peak wavelength of the\nbump feature in GNWY-7379420231, this suggests that the grain\ncomposition may differ compared to that at lower redshift, or these\nyoung galaxies could have a simpler dust-star geometry, as it is\nexpected that the galaxies with the most complex young geometries\nhave weaker bump strengths (Narayanan et al. 2018).\n4.4 Dust Production in the Early Universe\nThe detection of the 2175Å UV bump in GNWY-7379420231 pro-\nvides important constraints on its dust properties and evolution. The\nUV bump is predominantly seen in metal-rich galaxies at 𝑧≲3\n(e.g., Elíasdóttir et al. 2009; Noll et al. 2009; Shivaei et al. 2022),\nsuggesting it is commonly found in evolved systems. We find that\nour source is metal-enriched compared to galaxies of a similar mass\n(Curti et al. 2024a), with 𝑍neb ∼0.28𝑍⊙. The dust evolution within\ngalaxies depends strongly on the age and metallicity of the system,\nwith dust production in low metallicity systems controlled by stel-\nlar sources (AGB stars and SNe II). When the metallicity exceeds a\ncritical metallicity (𝑍cr), dust mass growth becomes dominated by\nmetal accretion onto existing dust grains within the ISM, and dust\nmass increases rapidly. This transition may occur at 10 −20% solar\nmetallicity (e.g. Asano et al. 2013; Rémy-Ruyer et al. 2014, 2015; Li\net al. 2019; Roman-Duval et al. 2022). The metallicity of our system\nsuggests that it has entered the regime of efficient ISM dust mass\nbuild up.\nFrom our SED fitting analysis of the integrated spectrum when\nadopting the Li dust model, we infer the presence of a very young\nstellar population, with 𝑡★∼22 Myr. If we were to rely solely on\nthe stellar age inferred from the integrated spectrum in isolation, we\nmust consider alternative dust production pathways, given that AGB\nstars capable of producing carbonaceous dust require a ∼300 Myr\ntimescale to evolve off the main sequence.\nA potential mechanism is through Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, formed\nwhen massive stars with initial masses > 30 𝑀⊙lose their hydrogen\nenvelope. Carbon sequence WR stars (WC stars) are known to pro-\nduce dust, including PAHs (Lau et al. 2022), although they may need\nto be in a binary system where the companion has a high mass-loss\nrate (e.g., Cherchneff et al. 2000; Lau et al. 2021; Peatt et al. 2023;\nSchneider & Maiolino 2024). However, their contribution may be\nlimited: just 27 ± 9% of WC stars display circumstellar dust within\nthe Milky Way (Rosslowe & Crowther 2015), and WR stars are rare\n(Eldridge et al. 2017), with few WC stars found in low metallicity\nenvironments (Massey 2003). Nonetheless, the large 0.1 −1.0𝜇m\ngrains produced would be more robust to destruction from the sub-\nsequent SN shocks, and have grain lifetimes ∼3 times greater than\n100Å sized grains (Jones et al. 1996). PAHs are also known to be\nhighly stable due to their honeycomb structure (Allamandola et al.\n1989; Tielens 2008; Lau et al. 2022).\nAlternatively, early dust production could be dominated by SNe\nunless the reverse shock is very significant, even more so if the IMF is\ntop-heavy (Schneider & Maiolino 2024, and references therein). Type\nII supernovae produce dust primarily made up of silicates, amorphous\ncarbon, magnetite, and corundum (Todini & Ferrara 2001), which can\nbe processed into PAHs. Amorphous carbon ejected into the ISM\ncan react with hydrogen to form hydrogenated amorphous carbons\n(HACs), which can then form PAHs through shattering due to grain-\ngrain collisions (Jones et al. 1996). Additionally, photoprocessing\nby UV radiation can lead to the formation of aromatic bonds, with\nlarger carbonaceous particles acting as a reservoir for the formation\nof smaller particles (Duley et al. 2015). Furthermore, graphitic grains\nwith isotopic compositions that suggest an origin in SNe have been\nidentified, most consistent with an origin in Type II SNe (e.g., Zinner\n1998; Nittler & Ciesla 2016). While the SNe reverse shock may\npreferentially destroy smaller grains (Nozawa et al. 2007), Jones\net al. (1996) suggests that as much as 5−15% of the starting graphite\ngrain mass may end up in < 14Å graphitic fragments, potentially\nforming PAHs through hydrogenation.\nHowever, morphological analysis of our source reveals a more\ncomplex system than initially suggested by the integrated spectrum.\nWhen we examine the source as a three-component system, we find\nevidence for an older stellar population masked by outshining effects,\na particular problem when coverage is limited to the rest-frame UV\nand optical (Giménez-Arteaga et al. 2024). This older stellar popu-\nlation is concentrated within Sérsic 1, the most massive of the three\ncomponents, with a mass-weighted age of 𝑡★= 252+20\n−46 Myr. While\nstars across a broader mass range (0.8-8𝑀⊙) can enter the AGB, car-\nbon grains are mostly produced in AGB stars within the mass range\n2𝑀⊙< 𝑚star < 3 −3.5𝑀⊙(Schneider & Maiolino 2024). Crucially,\nthis component shows substantial stellar mass build up at ages > 300\nMyr, where stars ∼3𝑀⊙enter the AGB. This could provide sufficient\ntime for AGB driven dust production to pre-enrich the ISM before\nthe merger event, although their evolution is less well understood in\nlow-metallicity environments (e.g., Herwig 2005).\nRecent galaxy evolution simulations (Narayanan et al. 2023,\n2024a) suggest that PAH formation is enhanced in environments with\nhigh velocity dispersions (highly turbulent gas) and strong radiation\nfields. Increased shattering rates are driven by these large ISM ve-\nlocity dispersions in galaxies with high sSFRs, resulting in increased\nfeedback energy per unit mass, driving up the fraction of ultrasmall\ngrains. Furthermore, elevated global SFRs can drive aromatisation\nby UV radiation (Narayanan et al. 2023). These theoretical predic-\nMNRAS 000, 1–16 (2025)\n\n\nThe 2175Å UV Bump in the EoR\n13\ntions align with our observations of GNWY-7379420231, where the\nUV bump is localised to the merger region characterised by extreme\n[Oiii]+H𝛽equivalent widths and sSFRs. This spatial alignment, com-\nbined with the evidence for an older stellar population in the main\ncomponent, suggests that the intense UV radiation and turbulence in\nthe merger region may be driving localised PAH formation through\nboth top-down shattering, as well as increased dust growth on small\ngrains within the turbulent ISM (Narayanan et al. 2024a).\n5 SUMMARY\nIn this paper, we have presented the analysis of JWST/NIRSpec obser-\nvations, revealing one of the most distant known galaxies exhibiting\na very strong 2175Å UV bump feature at 𝑧= 7.11 when the universe\nwas only ∼700 Myr old. We have presented a detailed analysis of the\ndust properties and stellar populations within GNWY-7379420231,\nfinding evidence for both intense ongoing star formation and an older\nstellar population, suggesting a complex dust production history. The\nspatial correlation between the UV bump and the recent burst of star\nformation, combined with the system likely being a merger, provides\nnew insights into high redshift dust evolution. Our main findings are\nsummarised as follows:\n• We find a strong UV bump with 𝐴𝜆, max = 0.46+0.06\n−0.07 mag in a\ngalaxy at 𝑧= 7.11. The peak wavelength of the UV bump is shifted by\n84Å (at 2.9𝜎significance) compared to that of the bump seen in the\nMW curve, which may suggest a different dust grain size distribution\nat high redshift.\n• While the integrated spectrum suggests a young stellar popula-\ntion with 𝑡★∼22 Myr, morphological analysis reveals the presence\nof an older stellar population in the most massive component with\nsignificant stellar mass with age > 300 Myr, potentially resolving the\napparent tension in dust production timescales.\n• Through resolved SED fitting, we determine that the UV bump is\nspatially correlated with the merger region, characterised by extreme\n[Oiii]+H𝛽equivalent widths, suggesting enhanced PAH formation\nin a turbulent environment with intense UV radiation.\n• We find that our galaxy is metal enriched compared to galax-\nies of a similar mass, which could indicate rapid dust mass build\nup through dust grain growth mechanisms. The presence of metal\nenrichment could indicate that grain growth has reached an efficient\ngrowth regime, with the metal enrichment resulting from the under-\nlying older stellar population.\nIn summary, we are able to provide new insights into potential dust\nformation and processing pathways at high redshift, suggesting that\nthe ISM was pre-enriched by the older stellar population, before the\ndust was processed into PAHs through turbulence and UV radiation\nwithin the merger region. The capabilities of JWST will allow us\nto probe dust production in the early universe in more depth, fur-\nther constraining the early methods of dust production. Finding more\ngalaxies which exhibit a UV bump, and building up a sample within\nthe EoR will allow us to gain an understanding of the production\nmechanisms, the dust composition, and enable us to probe star for-\nmation and chemical evolution within the first billion years of cosmic\ntime. Furthermore, upcoming sub-mm follow up will provide us with\nmulti-wavelength dust constraints, such as providing an estimate of\nthe dust-to-gas ratio of this source.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Adam Carnall and Thomas Harvey\nfor helpful conversations.

    "abstract": "Dust is a fundamental component of the interstellar medium (ISM) within\ngalaxies, as dust grains are highly efficient absorbers of UV and optical\nphotons. Accurately quantifying this obscuration is crucial for interpreting\ngalaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The extinction curves in the Milky\nWay (MW) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) exhibit a strong feature known as the\n2175A UV bump, most often attributed to small carbonaceous dust grains. This\nfeature was recently detected in faint galaxies out to z~7 suggesting rapid\nformation channels. Here we report the detection of a strong UV bump in a\nluminous Lyman-break galaxy at z = 7.11235, GNWY-7379420231, through\nobservations taken as part of the NIRSpec Wide GTO survey. We fit a dust\nattenuation curve that is consistent with the MW extinction curve within\n1{\\sigma}, in a galaxy just ~700 Myr after the Big Bang. From the integrated\nspectrum, we infer a young mass-weighted age (t* ~ 22-59 Myr) for this galaxy,\nhowever spatially resolved SED fitting unveils the presence of an older stellar\npopulation (t* ~ 252 Myr). Furthermore, morphological analysis provides\nevidence for a potential merger. The underlying older stellar population\nsuggests the merging system could be pre-enriched, with the dust illuminated by\na merger-induced starburst. Moreover, turbulence driven by stellar feedback in\nthis bursty region may be driving PAH formation through top-down shattering.\nThe presence of a UV bump in GNWY-7379420231 solidifies growing evidence for\nthe rapid evolution of dust properties within the first billion years of cosmic\ntime.",
