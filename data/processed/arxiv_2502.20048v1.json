Recent advancements in \nsingle-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) cameras have unlocked exceptional capabilities in \nsensitivity, time resolution, and high frame-rate imaging. Despite this, the application of large-\nformat SPAD arrays in speckle contrast analysis is still relatively uncommon.

This \nwork highlights the transformative impact of large SPAD cameras on DSCA, setting the stage \nfor new breakthroughs in optical imaging. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nI. INTRODUCTION \nIn a healthy individual, proper blood flow (BF) is vital for maintaining a steady supply \noxygen and essential energy sources, such as glucose and lactate, to organs, while also ensuring \nthe  efficient removal of metabolic waste products 1. Of particular importance is cerebral blood \nflow (CBF), which is crucial for optimal brain function 2, brain metabolism 3, and the brain's \nability to respond to external stimuli 4. For adults, typical CBF is around 50 ml/(100 g min) 5, \nwhereas in newborns, it ranges between 10-30 ml/(100 g min) 6. Any disruption to CBF can \nresult in significant brain damage, including ischemic injury or stroke 7. Real-time monitoring \nof blood flow is essential for diagnosing and managing a variety of medical conditions, such \nas stroke, traumatic or hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) 8, neurological disorders, \ncardio-cerebral diseases, cancer treatments, tissue perfusion in peripheral vascular diseases 9, \nbrain health and function 10, wound healing, sepsis, shock 11, skeletal muscle injuries 12, and \ntissue viability during surgical procedures. \nSeveral optical methods have been employed for non-invasive monitoring of both \nhealthy and pathophysiological tissues, including laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) 13, \nlaser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS), and Diffuse speckle \ncontrast analysis (DSCA) – also referred to as speckle visibility spectroscopy (SVS) or speckle \ncontrast optical spectroscopy (SCOS). A key distinction between these techniques lies in their \npenetration depth: while LSCI and LDF are typically limited to superficial tissues (less than 1 \nmm) due to their reliance on single or few dynamic scattering events, DSCA/SCOS and DCS \ncan penetrate much deeper, reaching several centimeters into tissue. \nDCS relies on temporal sampling methods, where traditional avalanche photodiodes \n(APDs) or advanced single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detectors capture intensity \nfluctuations from one or a few speckle grains to reconstruct temporal dynamics. In contrast, \nDSCA uses a spatial sampling approach, which doesn't require a detector with a high frame \nrate. Instead, the camera typically operates with an exposure time longer than the speckle field’s \ndecorrelation time, utilizing a larger detection area with many pixels to capture more photons \nand speckles. Originally, Bi et al. first proposed DSCA 14–16, drew heavily from the concepts \nof LSCI, focusing on average values rather than imaging blood flow. DSCA is sometimes \nreferred to as SVS 17 or SCOS 18, and it has been extensively studied theoretically 19,20 and \nexperimentally 21,22. Notably, Kim et al. (2023) demonstrated that DSCA/SCOS outperforms \nDCS, offering more than a 10-fold improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at a comparable \ncost. Importantly, while the setup for a fiber-based DSCA system is identical to that of DCS, \nDSCA does not require model-based fitting to separate absorption and scattering effects from \nthe dynamic signal, and thus it does not provide a quantitative estimate of blood flow 18. \nConventionally, DSCA combines the deep tissue penetration capabilities of DCS with the \nrelatively low-cost CCD or CMOS detectors used in LSCI. However, despite the use of these \naffordable detectors, DSCA has not yet seen widespread commercial adoption. With the \nintroduction of faster photon-counting detectors, such as SPAD cameras, which have negligible \nreadout noise, it is now possible to apply the spatial DSCA technique with improved statistical \nreliability in speckle contrast calculations. \n\n\nIn this study, we introduce a novel, compact 512 × 512 pixel SPAD array called ATLAS \n23,24 built with industry-standard CMOS technology, for deep tissue blood flow (BF) \nmeasurements using the DSCA approach. This detector array boasts high photon efficiency, \nminimal dead time, zero readout noise, and a high frame rate (up to 27kfps), all of which are \nessential for precise BF measurements in low-light, in vivo conditions. Future advancements \ncould enable real-time BF monitoring in freely moving subjects. To evaluate our ATLAS-\nDSCA system, we conducted deep tissue BF measurements in four healthy volunteers during \narterial arm cuff occlusion and forehead BF monitoring. Additionally, vibration phantom \nexperiments were performed, and the results were compared to those from a traditional DSCA \nsystem. \nA summary of existing DSCA/SCOS systems is provided in Table I, detailing laser \nwavelength, applications, sampling rate, source-detector separation, and sensor type. This table \nhighlights the evolution of DSCA technology and contextualizes the significance of our \nproposed system in advancing the field. \nThe structure of this paper is as follows: we first present the theoretical principles of \nDSCA, followed by a description of the SPAD camera architecture and system implementation. \nNext, we compare our phantom results with those from traditional DSCA methods. Finally, we \npresent the in vivo experimental results, discuss the advantages and limitations of the SPAD-\nDSCA system, and propose potential future improvements.  \nTable I Existing DSCA/SCOS system \nLaser \nWavelength \n(nm) \nApplications \nSampling \nrate (Hz) \nFiber-\nbased/fiberless \nSource-\ndetector \nseparation \n(mm) \nSystem \nname \nYear \nSensor \nRef. \nCW \n785 \nForearm \n30 \nFiber-based \n24 \nDSCA \n2013 \nEMCCD \n14 \nCW \n785 \nForearm and \npalm \n1 \nFiber-based \n15 \ntDSCA \n2013 \nCCD \n15 \nCW \n785 \nForearm \nN.A. \nFiberless \n30 \nSCOS \n2014 \nCCD \n18 \nCW \n671 \nPhantom \nN.A. \nFiberless \n18 \nDSCA \n2017 \nCCD \n25 \nCW \n785 \nForearm & \nforehead \nN.A. \nFibreless \n20 \nSCOS \n2018 \nSPAD \n(32×2) \n26 \nCW \n785 \nForearm, & \nforehead  \n300 \nFiber-based \n25 \nDSCA \n2020 \nCCD \n16 \nCW \n785 \nForehead \nN.A. \nFiber-based \n26 \nSCOS \n2023 \nsCMOS \n27 \nVHG \nholographic \n852 \nForearm, \nforehead & \narithmetic \ntests \nN.A. \nFiber-based \n45 \nSCOS \n2023 \nsCMOS \n28 \nCW \n785 \nForehead \n80 \nCompact and \nfiberless \n50 \nSCOS \n2024 \nSony \nIMX392 \n29 \nCW \n785 \nDiabetic \n330 \nFiber-based \n12 \nDSCA \n2024 \nCCD \n30 \nCW \n785 \nForearm \nN.A. \nFiber-based \n25 \nDSCA \n2024 \nGeneric \nphotodiode \n31 \nCW \n808 \nWrist, \nexercise \n390 \nFiber-based \n4.5 \nSCOS \n2024 \nBasler \nboost \n32 \nCW \n785 \nForearm, \nforehead & \narithmetic \ntests \n> 800 \nFiber-based \n30 \nDSCA \n2025 \nSPAD \n(512×512) \nours \n \n \n \n\n\nII. METHODS  \nA. Theoretical Background \nDSCA relies on the speckle contrast (𝜅), defined as the ratio of the standard deviation \n(𝜎𝐼(𝜌, 𝑇)) of the measured intensity during a specific exposure time to its mean (〈𝐼〉) across \nvarious speckles. DSCA quantifies the statistics of the fluctuation of the speckle pattern as the \nvariance of the measured intensity (𝜎𝐼\n2) either in spatial or temporal domains 33: \n                                                 𝜅2(𝜌, 𝑇) =\n𝜎𝐼\n2(𝜌,𝑇)\n〈𝐼(𝜌,𝑇)〉2                                                                 (1)        \nhere 𝜌 denotes the source-detector separation, T is the exposure time, and 𝜅2 varies between \nzero and one, with a higher value indicating a slower scatterer fluctuation. 𝜅 is related to the \nnormalized electric field auto-correlation function (𝑔1(𝑟, 𝑇)) is given by: \n                             𝜅2(𝜌, 𝑇) =\n2𝛽\n𝑇∫(1 −\n𝜏\n𝑇)|𝑔1(𝜌, 𝜏)|2𝑑𝜏\n𝑇\n0\n.                                                     (2) \nwhere 𝑔1(𝜌, 𝜏) = 𝐺1(𝜌, 𝜏) 𝐺1(𝜌, 0)\n⁄\n and 𝐺1(𝜌, 𝜏) represents the Green’s function of Brownian \nmotion at 𝜌 in a semi-infinite geometry 34. In this equation, 𝛽 is an experimental constant that \naccounts for the collection optics.  \nB. Noise Correction  \nIn practical applications, it is crucial to adjust the speckle contrast calculation to account \nfor shot noise and other noise sources inherent in the detection system. Since speckle contrast \n(κ) is influenced by the variance from the expected theoretical behavior, deviations become \nparticularly pronounced in regions with lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is important to \nnote that the calculation in Eq. (1) does not account for these additional noise contributions, \nespecially in areas with lower SNR. To address this, we define a corrected squared speckle \ncontrast 𝜅𝑐\n2 as follows: \n                                      𝜅𝑐\n2 = 𝜅𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑\n2\n−𝜅𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑡\n2\n−𝜅𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑘\n2\n                                                      (3)          \nBefore calculating 𝜅, the raw intensity images are corrected by subtracting dark counts and \nremoving bad pixels. The dark offset, determined as the average of 1000 dark images (with the \nlaser off), is subtracted from the raw intensity to obtain the corrected intensity 𝐼𝑐= 𝐼−𝐼𝐷. \nEven though the intensity is corrected, the variance from the dark noise is included in the \nintensity’s variance, making it essential to deduct the dark variance 𝜎𝐷\n2. Another significant \nnoise source is inherent shot noise, which follows Poisson statistics, with a variance equal to \nthe mean intensity in electrons [e-], defined as 𝜎𝑠\n2 = 〈𝐼𝑐〉. Since SPAD cameras have no readout \nnoise, Eq. (3) becomes: \n                                                    𝜅𝑐\n2 =\n𝜎𝐼𝑐\n2 −𝜎𝐷\n2−𝜎𝑠2\n〈𝐼𝑐〉2\n.                                                                     (4) \nThe blood flow index (BFi) is then related to 𝜅𝑐\n2 by: \n                                                       𝐵𝐹𝑖=\n1\n𝜅𝑐2                                                                            (5) \n\n\nIn all the findings presented in this paper, we use the normalized blood flow index (normalized \nBFi) to provide standardized BF data, enhancing comparability across measurements. The BFi \nmetric reflects the total blood volume transported within a specific time frame. According to \nPoiseuille's law 35, BF is strongly influenced by factors such as blood pressure, vessel radius, \nviscosity, and vessel length. Even small changes in vessel radius can have a significant impact \non BF due to its fourth-power relationship with radius. \nC. SPAD (ATLAS) Architecture  \nThe sensor, called ATLAS hereafter, features a 512 × 512 array of deep trench isolation \n(DTI) microlensed SPADs with a 10.17 µm pitch. It offers a peak photon detection efficiency \n(PDE) of 55% (26% at 940 nm) and a median dark count rate (DCR) of 500 cps at room \ntemperature, operating at 23 V with a breakdown voltage of 17.8 V 36. The passively quenched \nSPADs are organized into 4×4 groups using an OR-tree structure to form 128 × 128 \nmacropixels, each with a 40.68 µm pitch. Each macropixel is capable of computing a 31-tap \nautocorrelation function with a minimum correlation time of 1 µs (which can be reduced to 100 \nns, depending on the clock rate). \nATLAS supports the following operating modes: \n1. A 22-bit single-photon counting mode. \n2. A time-gated 22-bit single-photon counting mode via a balanced H-tree, with time gates \ngenerated by an FPGA or on-chip DLL at 15–30 ps granularity. \n3. A multispeckle DCS mode, delivering the average of individual pixel autocorrelations \nin an on-chip, high-speed “ensemble” mode 23,24. \n4. A DCS imaging mode 23,24. \nIn ATLAS, each photon is directly converted into a 1-bit count, eliminating the readout \nnoise typically encountered in CCD or CMOS imagers. The clock frequency is adjustable (e.g., \n20 MHz, 25 MHz, 50 MHz, 75 MHz), and TBIN_CLK_PERIODS can range from 32 to \n65,535. The chip is mounted on a PCB board and connected to a field-programmable gate array \n(FPGA), such as the Opal Kelly 7310-A200. \nIn the photon counting (PC) mode, as shown in FIG. 1(a), each pixel acquires photons \nduring a single exposure (TBIN period) and photons are counted with a 5-bit ripple counter. At \nthe end of the TBIN exposure, the shift register is clocked, transferring the 5-bit count into the \nfirst element (C(τ₀)) and subsequently accumulated to the first SRAM address. This is repeated \nfor a user defined number of integration cycles (i.e., TINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS). After which \nthe accumulated 22-bit count is read out via the column bus. It is worth noting that in the PC \nmode only the first elements of the Shift Register and SRAM are utilised, and the Multiplier is \n\n\nconfigured to multiply C(τ₀) with 1 (effectively by-passing the Multiplier). The remaining 31 \nshift register and SRAM elements are utilised in other DCS related modes. FIG. 1(b) shows \nthe Global shutter timing diagram for photon counting mode. \n \nFIG. 1. (a) Block diagram showing main blocks of the pixel schematic operating in Photon Counting mode. (b) \nGlobal shutter timing diagram for photon counting mode. Integration time: Tint, Row readout time: Trr.  \nD. Implementation（Experimental Setup） \nThe experimental setup is schematically illustrated in FIG. 2(a). A long-coherence 785-\nnm laser (>5 m coherence length, DL785-100-S from CrystaLaser) serves as the light source. \nLaser light is delivered to the phantom through a multimode (MM) fiber with a 200 µm core, \nwhile scattered light is collected by another MM fiber with the same core size. One end of the \ndetection fiber is placed on the phantom’s surface, with the other end aligned to the center of \nthe SPAD camera. Zoomed-in images of the SPAD chip (front view) and the Opal Kelly FPGA \nboard (back view) are also provided.  \nFIG. 2(b) displays simulation results of scattered light propagation through a “banana-\nshaped” region in tissue, simulated using MCmatlab [19] based on the MCXYZ model \ndeveloped by Jacques and Li [20]. The simulation settings are detailed in Ref. [21]. Considering \nthe SNR and flow sensitivity for speckle imaging in biomedical applications, typical exposure \ntimes range from 1 to 10 ms 37. In our experiments, we used an exposure time of 1.64 ms \n(TINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS = 1024) with 𝜌 = 15 mm, resulting in an image acquisition rate \nof 361.7 fps.  \n\n\n \nFIG. 2. (a) The schematic of the experimental setup illustrates the optical measurement system using multimode \nfibers (MMF) and a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD).

Zoomed-in images show the SPAD chip (front view) and the \nOpal Kelly FPGA board (back view). (b)  Simulation results depict scattered light traveling through a \"banana-\nshaped\" region in tissue. These simulations were conducted using MCmatlab 38 based on the model MCXYZ \ndeveloped by Jacques and Li 39. Detailed simulation settings can be found in Ref. 40. \nE. Data Processing \nThe data processing pipeline is shown in FIG. 3. Raw speckle data, also known as \nintensity imaging data under PC mode, is initially acquired as a three-dimensional matrix. The \nfirst step involves identifying and removing bad pixels, which are detected based on irregular \nsignal characteristics or abnormally high noise levels. Next, 𝜅 is extracted to isolate the signal \nfrom noise. Shot noise reduction is then applied to minimize high-frequency fluctuations \narising from the stochastic nature of photon detection, significantly enhancing the SNR. Finally, \nfiltering is performed to smooth the signal and preserve essential features for further analysis. \nThis processing pipeline ensures that the data is reliable and of high quality for subsequent \ninterpretation and modeling.  \nThe data processing pipeline for speckle contrast analysis follows a structured approach \nto ensure high-quality and reliable data extraction, as illustrated in FIG. 3. The process begins \nwith the collection of raw speckle data, a three-dimensional matrix that records intensity \nfluctuations over time. Once the data is acquired, a pixel quality assessment is performed to \nidentify and eliminate bad pixels that could introduce artifacts or bias into the analysis. \nSpecifically, 'hot' pixels—those with significantly higher dark counts 23—are detected and \nremoved using a 3-sigma rule. Any pixel that deviates more than three standard deviations from \nthe mean is replaced with NaN to prevent its influence on subsequent calculations, \nimplemented with: \n                                               𝐼[|𝐼−𝐼̅| > 3𝜎] = 𝑁𝑎𝑁.                                                          (6) \nwhere I is the frame data, and 𝐼̅ is the mean intensity of frame data, 𝜎 is the standard \ndeviation of the frame data. \n\n\nOnce bad pixels are identified, they are excluded from further calculations. For valid \npixels, κ is computed, and the BFi is derived using the inverse squared speckle contrast \nformula: BFi = 1/κ². The resulting signal is then subjected to noise reduction algorithms to \nminimize fluctuations caused by external disturbances or system imperfections. Filtering \ntechniques, including a smoothing window of 20, are applied to refine the data and highlight \nphysiologically relevant blood flow variations. Finally, the processed data is visualized, \nenabling the interpretation of BFi dynamics over time. This pipeline ensures the extraction of \naccurate and meaningful blood flow information while minimizing the impact of noise and \nartifacts. \n \nFIG. 3. The DSCA data analysis flow. Once the raw data is acquired, bad pixels (highlighted in red circles) are \nidentified and removed, followed by 𝜅 calculation, noise reduction, and final filtering. The final processed data is \nvisualized for interpretation. The right-side images provide visual insights into raw data, bad pixel identification, \nand signal refinement at different stages.  \n \n \n \n\n\nIII. RESULTS  \nA. Simulation Results \nAs a function of 𝜌  and T, the speckle contrast (𝜅 ) is computed using Eq. (2) and \npresented in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). In FIG. 4(a), 𝜅 decreases with increasing 𝜌 for T = 1, 3, and 5 \nms with a smaller T exhibiting a higher 𝜅. This trend aligns with the expectations that a larger \n𝜌 leads to greater photon scattering and diffusion, thereby reducing 𝜅. FIG. 4(b) demonstrates \nthe nonlinear decrease of 𝜅 and T at various 𝜌 values. As T increases, 𝜅 decreases in a nonlinear \nfashion, with the rate of decrease being more pronounced at a smaller 𝜌 , indicating that a \nshorter T captures more high-frequency speckle fluctuations associated with BF. To further \nexplore this dependency, FIG. 4(c) presents a 3D visualization of 𝜅 as a function of 𝜌 and T. \nThe surface plot clearly shows that 𝜅 is highest at smaller 𝜌 and 𝑇, confirming the interplay \nbetween spatial and temporal factors in speckle contrast dynamics. Finally, FIG. 4(d) presents \nthe relationship between 1\n𝜅2\n⁄\n and 𝛼𝐷𝑏 (BFi), where it is evident that BFi increases linearly \nwith 1\n𝜅2\n⁄\n. Unlike DCS, which requires fitting the second-order correlation function g2, our \ndirect relationship (BFi = 1\n𝜅2\n⁄\n ) simplifies the calculation and improves accuracy and \ncomputational efficiency. The simulations were conducted when λ = 785 nm, 𝜇𝑎 = 0.01 mm−1, \n𝜇𝑠\n′ = 1 mm−1, and the refractive index n = 1.33, representative of a typical tissue-mimicking \nmedium. \n \nFIG. 4.

(c) 3D visualization of 𝜅 as a function of \n\n\nboth ρ and 𝑇. (d) A linear relationship between of 1 𝜅2\n⁄\n and 𝛼𝐷𝑏, showing the expected theoretical trend, with 𝑇 \n= 2 ms. Here 𝜆= 785 𝑛𝑚, 𝜇𝑎= 0.01 𝑚𝑚−1, 𝜇𝑠\n′ = 1 𝑚𝑚−1, and 𝑛= 1.33.  \nB. Measurement Flexibility  \nThe measurement flexibility of the ATLAS-DSCA was assessed by varying the \nTINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS parameter in our custom software. Table II summarizes the \nrelationship between TINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS, exposure time, frame readout time, frame \ntime, and frame rate for the global shutter mode. As the exposure time increases, the frame rate \ndecreases, highlighting the impact of a longer integration period on the data acquisition speed. \nSpecifically, increasing TINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS leads to a proportional rise in the exposure \ntime, significantly reducing the achievable frame rate. For instance, with a clock frequency of \n20 MHz and TINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS set to 32, the system achieves a frame rate of 849.2 \nfps. However, at TINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS = 65,535, the frame rate drops to 9.4 fps. \nTable II.

For example, TINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS values of 32, \n1024, and 4096 correspond to sampling rates of 849.2 Hz, 361.7 Hz, and 130.2 Hz, respectively. \nFewer iterations result in a higher temporal resolution, allowing for the capture of rapid \ndynamics, whereas more iterations produce smoother curves due to the enhanced SNR (SNR \n= 10𝑙𝑜𝑔10(\n𝑆𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟\n𝑁𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒 𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟) ), albeit with a reduced temporal resolution. Here, we obtain SNR \nvalues of 12.10 dB, 25.13 dB, and 30.32 dB for TINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS = 32, 1024, and \n4096, respectively. A lower TINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS means a shorter T, leading to a lower \nκ, which is in good agreement with the simulation results shown in FIG. 4(b). FIG. 5(b) presents \nthe raw signal amplitude for the three iteration settings, highlighting the increased signal \nintensity and noise levels associated with lower iterations. In FIG. 5(c), the power spectral \n\n\ndensity (PSD) analysis, computed using Welch’s method, further reveals the impact of iteration \nsettings on signal frequency content. Welch’s method can estimate the PSD by segmenting the \nsignal into overlapping sections, applying a window function, and averaging the periodograms. \nThe PSD estimate using Welch’s method is given by: \n                              𝑃𝑆𝐷(𝑓) =\n1\n𝑀∑\n𝑃𝑚(𝑓)\n𝑀\n𝑚=1\n, 𝑃𝑚(𝑓) =\n1\n𝑁|𝐹𝐹𝑇(𝑥𝑚)|2,                               (7) \nwhere f is the frequency at which the PSD is estimated, M is the number of overlapping \nsegments into which the signal is divided, and 𝑃𝑚(𝑓) is the periodogram (power spectrum \nfor a given segment) of the m-th segment at f. N is the length of each segment, and 𝑥𝑚 is \nthe m-th segment of the signal. FFT stands for Fast Fourier Transform. By averaging \nmultiple periodograms, Welch’s method reduces variance and provides a smoother \nrepresentation of the frequency components. The low iteration setting (red) allows for higher \nfrequency components to be preserved, whereas increasing the iterations results in a more \nattenuated high-frequency response, favoring smoother signals. These findings emphasize the \ntrade-off between the temporal resolution and signal quality, where fewer iterations improve \ntemporal tracking but introduce higher noise, whereas more iterations enhance signal stability \nat the cost of high-frequency information. These findings highlight the trade-off between the \ntemporal resolution and data quality, underscoring the system’s versatility to meet various \nexperimental needs. The measurements were conducted on the left arm of a healthy volunteer \nat ρ = 12 mm (laser power: 4 mW), with the SPAD sensor set to a clock frequency of 20 MHz \nand TBIN_CLK_PERIODS = 32. The clock frequency is also adjustable (e.g., 50 MHz, 75 \nMHz) depending on experimental requirements. \n\n\n \nFIG. 5.

Phantom and In Vivo Measurements  \n1. Phantom Measurements \nPhantom measurements were performed using a setup that simultaneously compared the \nATLAS-DSCA and a conventional CMOS-DSCA systems. We employed a home-made solid \nsilica phantom (with unmeasured optical properties, as no quantitative calculation was intended) \ncontaining a vibration motor whose intensity can be controlled externally. FIG. 6(a) shows the \nexperimental setup, where a laser illuminates the solid silica phantom through an MMF, and \nscattered light is collected via two separate MMFs: one connected to the ATLAS-DSCA system \nand the other to the CMOS-DSCA system. A vibration motor embedded in the phantom induces \ncontrolled motion, with vibration levels (0, 12, 24, 36, 52) adjusted through an external \ncontroller. FIG. 6(b) presents the time-dependent normalized BFi measured by both systems. \nThe stepwise increases in BFi correspond to different vibration levels applied to the phantom, \nillustrating the responsiveness of ATLAS-DSCA and CMOS-DSCA to dynamic changes. A \nnoticeable discrepancy between the BFi values obtained from the two systems likely reflects \n\n\ninherent differences in their measurement characteristics, such as quantum efficiency, dark \ncurrent, and other detector-specific factors, between CMOS and SPAD detectors. This \ndiscrepancy validates the feasibility of the ATLAS-DSCA method under controlled conditions, \npaving the way for its application in complex in vivo scenarios. \n \nFIG. 6. (a) Experimental setup for DSCA: A laser illuminates a solid silica phantom via an MMF, with scattered \nlight collected by two separate MMFs for ATLAS- and CMOS-DSCA detection. A vibration motor inside the \nphantom generates controlled motion at intensities 0,12,24,35,52. (b) Normalized BFi over time for ATLAS-\nDSCA (blue) and CMOS-DSCA (orange), showing responses to varying vibration levels. \n2. Arm Cuff Occlusion \nTo further demonstrate the ATLAS-DSCA system, in vivo measurements were conducted using \nan arm cuff occlusion model at 𝜌 = 10, 20, and 30 mm. As shown in FIG. 7(a), volunteers sat \ncomfortably with their left arm placed on a pad and the ATLAS-DSCA probe attached to the \nwrist. FIG. 7(b) presents relative BFi (rBFi = BFi / BFibaseline) time series data for four subjects \nat different 𝜌 values, highlighting the microvascular hemodynamic changes during occlusion \nand subsequent recovery. After a baseline period of approximately 3.5 s, a blood pressure cuff \nwas inflated to 200 mmHg for 7 s. Upon cuff release, blood flow recovery was recorded for 4 \ns. The gray-shaded regions indicate the cuff inflation period, during which a marked decrease \nin rBFi is observed. Upon cuff release, the rBFi overshoots to a hyperemic value much larger \nthan the baseline as expected, with varying recovery kinetics across subjects and measurement \ndepths. Notably, the reduction in rBFi is more pronounced at a shorter ρ (ρ = 10 mm), \nsuggesting that superficial microvascular networks exhibit a stronger response than deeper \ntissues, where SNR may be lower.  \n\n\n \nFIG. 7. (a) The schematic representation of the experimental setup, where a blood pressure cuff is placed on the \nupper arm to induce controlled vascular occlusion, with a certain 𝜌. (b) Temporal rBFi variations at 𝜌 = 10, 20, \nand 30 mm for four subjects (Subjects #1~#4). The gray-shaded regions indicate the period of cuff inflation, \nduring which blood flow is restricted. The signals show a characteristic decrease in rBFi during occlusion, \nfollowed by a recovery phase after cuff deflation.  \n3. In Vivo Forehead Measurements \nATLAS-DSCA was also applied to monitor cerebral blood flow on the adult human \nforehead, as shown in FIG. 8(a). FIG. 8(b) represents the temporal variations in normalized \nBFi (blue) and photoplethysmography (PPG, red) signals at ρ = 20 mm and ρ = 25 mm. The \nBFi reflects cerebral blood flow fluctuations, whereas the PPG indicates peripheral blood \nvolume changes. A clear phase shift between the two signals is observed, highlighting the \ndifferences in hemodynamic responses at varying tissue depths. The average intensity, which \nis similar to the PPG signal, serves as an indicator of blood volume 41. In our measurements, \nthe BF waveform exhibits sharper peaks and more detailed features within each cardiac cycle \nthan the PPG waveform, with the BF peak consistently preceding the blood volume peak – a \nphenomenon also reported in Ref. 16.  \n\n\n \nFIG. 8. (a) The schematic representation of the measurement setup. (b) Normalized BFi (in blue) and \nphotoplethysmography (PPG, in red) signals at 𝜌  = 20 and 25 mm. The signals exhibit a clear correlation, \nreflecting hemodynamic fluctuations over time.  \nTo further demonstrate the sensitivity of ATLAS-DSCA, FIG. 9 presents cerebral \nfunction monitoring during a mental arithmetic task (at ρ = 20 mm) in two subjects. FIG. 9(a) \nshows the experimental setup, where the probe was placed on the forehead, targeting the \nprefrontal cortex, which plays a key role in cognitive processes such as reading unfamiliar text, \nplanning, and working memory 42,43. In this experiment, subjects rested for 8 seconds before \nbeing presented with math questions for 30 seconds, followed by a recovery period after \nremoving the questions. FIG. 9(b) illustrates a representative BFi measurement from one \nsubject. The upper and lower envelopes of the BFi signal (denoted as up1 and lo1, respectively) \nwere calculated using MATLAB’s envelope function with the ‘peak’ method (window size = \n250). The trend of the BFi signal is defined as: \n                                                       𝐵𝐹𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑙=\n𝑢𝑝1+𝑙𝑜1\n2\n.                                                           (8)   \nTaking the first 8 seconds as the baseline, the percentage change in BFi is calculated as:  \n \n                                                      BFi changes = \n|𝐵𝐹𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑙−𝐵𝐹𝑖𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒|\n𝐵𝐹𝑖𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒\n× 100%.                     (9) \n \nAs shown in FIG. 9(c) and 9(d), we observed that blood flow significantly increased by \n3.8% to 10.1% (average over three trials per subject) during activation and returned to baseline \nvalues post-activation, consistent with expected physiological responses. The shaded area \nrepresents the standard deviation of the three trials for each subject, calculated using built-in \nMATLAB functions. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using ATLAS-DSCA to \n\n\ntrack neurovascular dynamics in response to cognitive stimuli, offering valuable insights into \ncerebral hemodynamic responses associated with mental effort. \n \nFIG. 9.

The shaded region represents the standard deviation, whereas the dashed vertical lines indicate the \nstart and end of the cognitive task. \nIV. DISCUSSION \nWe introduce the ATLAS-DSCA system, which leverages a 512×512 SPAD array for \nnon-invasive deep tissue blood flow measurement. Our findings show that the ATLAS-DSCA \noffers a comparable performance to traditional CMOS-DSCA systems, but with the added \nbenefit of a higher sampling rate. Validation studies, including arm cuff occlusion, in vivo \nforehead measurements, and cognitive task trials in healthy subjects, all confirm the robustness \nand effectiveness of our approach. \nPhantom experiments (FIG. 6(b)) conducted alongside a CMOS-DSCA system further \nvalidate the reliability of the ATLAS-DSCA. Additionally, arm cuff occlusion studies (FIG. \n7(b)) highlight the system’s ability to assess deep tissue blood flow, demonstrated by the \npronounced hyperaemic response following cuff release. Cognitive task experiments (FIG. 9(c) \nand 9(d)) also show a marked increase in blood flow during mental arithmetic, aligning with \nprevious research 28,44. \n\n\nAs presented in Table I, Kim et al.'s SCOS system achieved ρ = 40 mm with a sampling \nrate of 160 Hz 28. However, their approach involves certain trade-offs, such as the use of lower-\ncost CMOS cameras, which introduce higher readout noise, reduced bit depth, and non-linear \nor non-uniform camera gains. To improve photon flux without exceeding safety limits, they \nimplemented a pulsing strategy (10% duty cycle) with an optical chopper on a volume \nholographic laser, resulting in a more complex optical setup. Additionally, their system \nincorporates a complicated 4f structure, making it bulkier and less portable. \nIn contrast, Huang et al.'s system 29 achieved ρ = 50 mm with a sampling rate of 80 Hz, \nwhich captures low-frequency signals (< 65 Hz), unable to resolve high-frequency components, \nas shown in FIG. 5(c) (blue curve), which may result in missing critical information. However, \nour ATLAS-DSCA system is capable of resolving high-frequency signals (> 200 Hz), making \nit ideal for analyzing dynamic, rapidly changing physiological signals. They used a higher laser \npower (45 mW) to achieve ρ = 50 mm. Their detection probe is designed to place CMOS image \nsensors close to the patient’s skin, eliminating the need for detection fibers. This increases \nphoton collection and improves the SNR, making it ideal for adult stroke diagnostics. However, \nthis design is less suitable for premature or neonatal patients, who require minimal disruption. \nIn comparison, our ATLAS-DSCA system, while achieving ρ = 30 mm, distinguishes \nitself with an exceptional sampling rate exceeding 800 Hz. Not only can it detect human blood \nflow, but it is also suitable for monitoring animal health and wellbeing (for small animals, the \nheart rate typically ranges from 4 to 12.5 Hz, or 240 to 750 beats per minute 45). This high \nsampling rate also opens the door to broader applications, including ultrasound detection, \nassuming the SPAD’s bandwidth and sensitivity support higher frequencies. A major \nadvantage of our system is its flexibility: the ATLAS can incorporate multiple fibers by \ndividing the sensor into several sensing clusters, offering greater versatility. Additionally, the \nATLAS-DSCA system can operate in DCS mode, providing ρ = 50 mm (research results to be \npublished separately) using on-chip autocorrelators 24,46.  \nSeveral studies 26,47–49 have compared DCSA/SCOS and DCS technologies, employing \neither Monte Carlo simulations or separate detectors—one dedicated to DCSA/SCOS and \nanother to DCS. In contrast, our DSCA/DCS system allows switching between DCS and DSCA \nmodes, facilitating a more controlled and direct comparison.  \nFurthermore, there are two main approaches for capturing temporal dynamics: temporal \nsampling methods (such as DCS using SPAD arrays) and speckle ensemble methods (like \nSVS/DSCA and LSCI). While temporal sampling methods require extremely high frame rates \n(above 26 kfps, as highlighted in Wang et al.’s review 34) to capture fast fluctuations, speckle \nensemble methods improve SNR by integrating over multiple speckles. Our work demonstrates \nthat, although SPAD sensors may not be ideal for traditional DCS (calculating g2 using \nsequential frame data), they hold significant promise in DSCA, SCOS, and SVS applications. \nLastly, it is important to note that our SPAD array maintains a high SNR even with very \nshort exposure times (as low as 51.2 µs), thanks to its lack of readout noise and minimal dead \ntime—critical advantages that enhance the performance of the ATLAS-DSCA system.  \nWe believe, recent advancements in SPAD technology—such as the development of \nlarge-area SPAD arrays (512×512) and improved time-gated detection—suggest that SPADs \ncould play a more prominent role in next-generation DSCA/SCOS applications. Their \nunparalleled temporal resolution, high sampling rate and ability to perform time-gated \n\n\nmeasurements make them particularly attractive for deep-tissue blood flow imaging and \nfunctional neuroimaging applications. Moreover, the algorithm we developed for the fiber-\nbased ATLAS-DSCA system (see FIG. 3) may server as an effective foundation for advancing \nSPAD-based DSCA/SCOS methodologies. \nV. CONCLUSION \nIn conclusion, we present a groundbreaking fiber-based, ultra-high-speed DSCA \nsystem using a large-format SPAD camera for non-invasive deep tissue blood flow sensing. By \ncombining a custom-designed SPAD array with cutting-edge optical and signal processing \ntechniques, our system achieves an exceptional temporal resolution and sensitivity, enabling \nthe capture of rapid, dynamic blood flow variations across a broad field of view. Extensive \nexperimental validations—from phantom studies and cuff occlusion tests to in vivo \nmeasurements—demonstrate that our DSCA system reliably detects deep tissue hemodynamic \nchanges and outperforms traditional CMOS-based systems in sampling rate. \nMoreover, the system's high-speed capabilities open the door to a broad range of biomedical \napplications, from human clinical diagnostics to animal physiological monitoring, with \npotential for expanding into ultrasound detection. While this work underscores the \ntransformative potential of large SPAD array cameras in DSCA, we anticipate that future \nsensor technology and signal processing advancements will further elevate its performance and \nbroaden its clinical and research utility. \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThis work has been funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council \n(Grant No. EP/T00097X/1 and No. EP/T020997/1): the Quantum Technology Hub in Quantum \nImaging (QuantiC) and the University of Strathclyde, as well as A*STAR Biomedical \nEngineering Programme (BEP) C221318003 and A*STAR BMRC CRF fund 2024.  \n \nDATA AVAILABILITY \nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding \nauthor upon reasonable request. \n \nDECLARATIONS \nEthics Approval Statement Six healthy participants, aged between 20 and 35 years, with no \nhistory of neurological disorders, were recruited for this study.

    "abstract": "Diffuse speckle contrast analysis (DSCA), also called speckle contrast\noptical spectroscopy(SCOS), has emerged as a groundbreaking optical imaging\ntechnique for tracking dynamic biological processes, including blood flow and\ntissue perfusion. Recent advancements in single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD)\ncameras have unlocked exceptional capabilities in sensitivity, time resolution,\nand high frame rate imaging. Despite this, the application of large-format SPAD\narrays in speckle contrast analysis is still relatively uncommon. In this\nstudy, we introduce a pioneering use of a large format SPAD camera for DSCA. By\nharnessing the camera's high temporal resolution and photon detection\nefficiency, we significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of speckle\ncontrast measurements. Our experimental results demonstrate the system's\nremarkable ability to capture rapid temporal variations over a broad field of\nview, enabling detailed spatiotemporal analysis. Through simulations, phantom\nexperiments, and in vivo studies, we validate the approach's potential for a\nwide range of biomedical applications, such as cuff occlusion tests and\nfunctional tissue monitoring. This work highlights the transformative impact of\nlarge SPAD cameras on DSCA, paving the way for new breakthroughs in optical\nimaging.",
