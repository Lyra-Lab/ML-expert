The synergy \nbetween natural gas networks (NGN) and electric power \nsystems (EPS) significantly enhances energy efficiency and \nreduces emissions [2], yet their complex interdependencies \npose operational risks that demand rigorous analysis. The \nemergence of power-to-gas (P2G) technology is transforming \nNGN-EPS interactions from unidirectional to bidirectional \nexchanges [3], further adding complexity to integrated \nelectricity and gas system (IEGS) operations. \nThe dynamic energy flow (DEF) analysis is a critical \nfoundation for evaluating the operational security of IEGS, \nrequiring large-scale nonlinear partial differential algebraic \nequations (PDAEs). While numerical approaches like finite \ndifference methods (FDMs) [3, 4] and characteristic line \nmethods [5] have been explored for the DEF analysis, they face \ncomputational bottlenecks, including intensive computational \ncost and convergence issues because of the nonlinear NGN and \nEPS equations. In light of this, we develop a semi-analytical \n(SA) algorithm that features high accuracy and low \ncomputational cost for the DEF analysis of IEGS, offering an \nefficient tool for the operational analysis of IEGS. \nB. \nLiterature Review \nThe energy flow analysis of IEGS can be divided into the \nsteady one and the dynamic one based on the energy flow \ntransport models it uses. The steady energy flow analysis uses \nalgebraic equations (AEs) to describe the gas flows in the \npipelines by ignoring the dynamic evolution process, focusing \non the long-term (usually above hours) operational conditions \nof the systems [6]. Comparatively, the DEF analysis uses partial \ndifferential equations (PDEs) to describe the gas flow dynamics \nalong the pipelines, focusing on the short-term (from seconds \nto minutes) operational conditions of the systems [7].  \nThis work focuses on the DEF analysis problem of IEGS, \nwhich is typically large-scale nonlinear PDAEs because of the \noccurrence of the nonlinear gas dynamics in NGN and the \nnonlinear power flow in EPS. To solve the DEF model, the \ntraditional numerical methods consist of two steps: 1) \nDiscretizing the PDEs into AEs using methods such as FDMs \nand finite volume methods; 2) Solving the nonlinear AEs using \niterative methods, typically including Newton’s method, Quasi-\nNewton method, and Levenberg-Marquardt Method. For \nexample, in [8], the implicit Euler difference schemes are used \nto discretize the PDEs of gas flow, and in [4], the centered-\ndifference form in space and the fully implicit algorithm in time \nare proposed for the gas flow equations and then compared with \nother difference schemes under Newton’s method. Although \nthe numerical methods are easy to use, they have some inherent \ndrawbacks. First, in the discretization step, to ensure stability \nand accuracy, the temporal and spatial steps cannot be too large \nand need to satisfy some specific constraints, which usually \nintroduce many variables and equations, greatly increasing the \nproblem scale. Second, in solving the nonlinear AEs, it is very \nchallenging to select a starting point that is guaranteed to be in \nthe convergence region [9], which is still an open problem in \nthe field of nonlinear system computation. \nConsidering the shortcomings of the numerical methods, the \nSA approaches have received some attention in recent years, \nsuch as the differential transformation (DT) and the \nholomorphic embedded (HE) methods [10-12], featuring the \nrigorousness of analytical methods and the flexibility of \nnumerical methods. Particularly, the SA approaches do not \nrequire iterative calculation to solve nonlinear problems and \nthus outperform in calculation accuracy and convergence. In the \nfield of energy systems, the SA approach was first utilized to \nsolve the power flow model with AEs and electromechanical \ntransient simulation with ordinary differential algebraic \nequations (ODAEs) [13, 14]. By contrast, designing an efficient \nSA-based algorithm for the DEF model of IEGS is more \nchallenging since it is a nonlinear PDAE model. \nRecently, the SA approaches have also been explored in the \nfield of integrated energy systems. Yu et al. [15] first \ninvestigate the DT-based SA approach for solving the DEF \nI\n\n\nHuang, et al. Dynamic Energy Flow Analysis of Integrated Electricity and Gas Systems: A Semi-Analytical Approach \n2\nmodel of integrated heat and electricity systems. Zhang et al. \n[16] and Huang et al. [17] explore the HE-based SA approach \nfor solving the DEF model of IEGS, in which the treatment of \ndifference schemes and boundary conditions may cause some \nproblems. Specifically, their approach encounters singularities \nin the coefficient matrix of the equations when addressing loop \nnetworks or multiple gas source problems in NGN due to \ninconsistent pressures at pipeline tail converging on the same \nnode. In [16], an assumption of equal pressures at the head and \ntail of the last segment of these pipelines is made, which may \nintroduce computational errors. Overall, the SA approach for \nthe DEF models is still in the initial stage. The research gaps \ninclude: 1) How to efficiently deal with the PDAE model of \nNGN in the SA approach is still unsolved; 2) it remains unclear \nhow to exploit the special structure of the DEF model in IEGS \nto improve the computing performance. \nC. \nContributions \nTo bridge the aforementioned research gaps, we propose a \nnovel SA algorithm for the DEF model of IEGS, which features \nhigher \ncomputation \nefficiency \nand \nrobustness \nwhile \nmaintaining \nhigh \naccuracy. \nCase \nstudies \nverify \nthe \neffectiveness of the proposed method. The main contributions \nare summarized as follows. \n(1) We propose a novel non-iterative DT-based algorithm for \nthe DEF model of IEGS. Compared with the numerical method, \nit avoids the iterative calculation of the equation and greatly \nreduces the number of matrix inversions. \n(2) We propose a spatial difference scheme and a numerical \nboundary construction method to convert the PDE of gas \ndynamics into ODAEs to resort to the SA approach, solving the \ncoefficient matrix singularity problem in the SA approach and \nfeaturing the 2nd-order spatial precision. \n(3) We propose an adaptive window control technique for the \nDT-based DEF calculation, which uses estimated truncation \nerrors to adjust the size of each time window for higher \nrobustness. \nII. \nPROBLEM DESCRIPTION \nIn this section, we first present the DEF model of IEGS. \nSecond, the initial and boundary conditions for solving the DEF \nmodel are formulated. Finally, the classical FDM-based \nnumerical algorithm for the DEF model is briefly introduced. \nA. \nDynamic Energy Flow Model \nThe DEF model of IEGS includes the NGN model, the EPS \nmodel, and the coupling components model, which are \nintroduced separately in the following.  \n1) \nNatural gas network \nThe NGN transports natural gas from source nodes to load \nnodes through pipelines. The NGN model describes the gas \ndynamics in the pipelines and the mass conservation and \npressure consistency at the nodes. The schematic of the NGN \nmodel is given in Fig. 1. \nThe gas dynamics in the pipeline can be described by the \nmass conservation and momentum conservation equations [18]. \nIn this work, we adopt the following assumptions widely used \nin existing work [3, 19] to model the gas dynamics including: \n1) The pipeline is horizontal; 2) The gas transmission in \npipelines is a constant temperature process; 3) The convection \nin the pipeline is negligible. Under these assumptions, the gas \ndynamics in the pipeline can be described by the continuity \nequation (1a) and momentum equation (1b), as: \n \n2\n0\npl\npl\nj\nj\nj\nm\nc\nt\nS\nl\n\n\n\n+\n=\n\n\n, \n(1a) \n \n0\n2\npl\npl\npl\npl\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\npl\nj\nj\nj\nc m\nm\nm\n+ S\n+\n=\nt\nl\n2D S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, \n(1b) \nwherein 𝑗= 1,2, ⋯, 𝐽 is the index of the pipeline; 𝐽 is the \nnumber of pipelines in NGN; 𝑆𝑗 is the cross-sectional area of \npipeline 𝑗, m2; 𝜆𝑗 is the friction factor of pipeline 𝑗; 𝐷𝑗 is the \ndiameter of pipeline 𝑗, m; 𝑐 is the sound velocity in gas, m s\n⁄ ; \n𝜋𝑗\n𝑝𝑙 is the gas pressure of pipeline 𝑗, Pa; 𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙 is mass flow of \npipeline 𝑗, kg s\n⁄ . \nHere, since 𝜋𝑗\n𝑝𝑙 and 𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙 are spatially distributed along the \npipeline 𝑗, as indicated in Fig. 1, in the following, we use \n𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙(𝑙, 𝑡)  and 𝜋𝑗\n𝑝𝑙(𝑙, 𝑡) , 𝑙∈[0, 𝐿𝑗], 𝑡∈[0, 𝑇]  to denote their \nvalues in the location 𝑙 and time 𝑡 to facilitate the modeling of \nnodes, wherein 𝐿𝑗 is the length of pipeline 𝑗 and 𝑇 is the \nsimulation duration, respectively. Especially we use 𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙(0, 𝑡) \nand 𝜋𝑗\n𝑝𝑙(0, 𝑡)  (or 𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙(𝐿𝑗, 𝑡)  and 𝜋𝑗\n𝑝𝑙(𝐿𝑗, 𝑡) ) to denote the \nvalues at the head (or tail) of pipeline 𝑗 at time 𝑡. \nNext, we introduce three matrixes to describe the mass \nconservation and pressure consistency at the nodes, including \n𝐾𝑖𝑛∈ℝ𝐼×𝐽, 𝐾𝑜𝑢𝑡∈ℝ𝐼×𝐽, and 𝐾𝑐𝑚𝑝∈ℝ𝐼, wherein 𝐼 is the \nnumber of nodes in NGN. Their elements are defined as: \n \nIf the gas in pipeline  flows into node \n,\nOtherw\n1,\ni\n0\nse\nin\nij\nK\nj\ni\n\n= \n\n, \n \n \nIf the gas in pipeline  flows out of node \n,\nOtherw\n,\ns\n1\ni\n0\ne\nout\nij\nK\nj\ni\n\n= \n\n, \n \nIf node  has the\ni\n,\ncompr\n \n,\nOtherw se\ns\ne sor\n1\ncmp\ncmp\nik\nK\ni\n\n= \n, \nwherein 𝐾𝑖𝑛 and 𝐾𝑜𝑢𝑡 describe the connection relationship \nbetween pipelines and nodes, respectively; 𝐾𝑐𝑚𝑝 denotes the \nexistence of compressors at nodes; 𝑘𝑖\n𝑐𝑚𝑝 is the pressure ratio of \nthe compressor at node 𝑖. \nThen, the nodal mass conservation equations are as: \n \n( )\n(\n)\n(\n)\n0,\n,\nou\ni\nnd\np\nt\nn\nl\npl\nm\nt\n= K\nm\nt\nm\nK\nt\nL\n−\n, \n(1c) \nwherein 𝑚𝑛𝑑(𝑡) ∈ℝ𝐼 is the vectors of injection mass flow of \nnodes at time 𝑡; 𝑚𝑝𝑙(0, 𝑡) = [𝑚1\n𝑝𝑙(0, 𝑡)   𝑚2\n𝑝𝑙(0, 𝑡) ⋯ \nFig. 1.

For the electricity-driven compressor with \nknown pressure ratios at node 𝑖 in NGN and bus 𝑏 in EPS, we \nuse the linear model to calculate the power consumption [20], \nas: \n \n(\n)\n(\n)\n,\n,\n0,\ntan\nout\nC\ni\nb\nb\nC\npl\nb i\nb\nb\nK\nK\nS\nm\ni\nt\nq\np\np\nb\n\n\n\n= −\n=\n, \n(1i) \nwherein 𝐾𝑏,𝑖\n𝐶 is the efficiency of the gas compressor; 𝜃𝑏 is the \nphase difference angle of the compressor; 𝑝𝑏 and 𝑞𝑏 are the \nactive and reactive power injection for the bus where the \ncompressor is located, respectively; vector 𝐾𝑖\n𝑜𝑢𝑡 is the 𝑖th row \nof the matrix 𝐾𝑜𝑢𝑡; 𝑆𝐶 is the set of NGN nodes and EPS bus \nlabels where all compressors are located. \nFor the GT that is located at node 𝑖 in NGN and supplies \npower at bus 𝑏 in EPS, the generated power is calculated as [3]: \n \n(\n)\n,\n,\nGFU\ni\ni\nGT\nnd\nb\nb\np =\nK\ni b\nm\nS\n−\n\n\n, \n(1j) \nwherein 𝐾𝑏,𝑖\n𝐺𝑇 is the conversion efficiency of gas into electricity; \n𝑝𝑏 is the active power injection for the bus where the GT is \nlocated; 𝑚𝑖\n𝑛𝑑 is the gas injection for the node where the GT is \nlocated; 𝑆𝐺𝑇 is the set of NGN nodes and EPS bus labels where \nall GTs are located. \nFor the P2G that is located as bus 𝑏 in EPS and supplies gas \nat node 𝑖 in NGN, the gas output can be calculated as [16]: \n \n(\n)\n2\n,\n2\n,\ntan\nP G\ni\ni\nb\nb\nnd\nP G\nb\nb\nb\n=\nK\nm\np\nS\ni b\np\nq\n\n\n=\n−\n\n, \n(1k) \nwherein 𝐾𝑏,𝑖\n𝑃2𝐺 is the conversion efficiency of electricity into gas; \n𝜃𝑏 is the phase difference angle of the P2G; 𝑝𝑏 and 𝑞𝑏 are the \nactive and reactive power injection for the bus where the \ncompressor is located, respectively; 𝑚𝑖\n𝑛𝑑 is the gas injection for \nthe node where the P2G is located; 𝑆𝑃2𝐺 is the set of NGN \nnodes and EPS bus where the P2Gs are located. \nB. \nInitial and Boundary Conditions \nFor the DEF model, the initial and boundary conditions are \nthe prerequisites for the uniqueness of the solution. The initial \nconditions provide the initial values of states for solving the \n(partial) differential equations, while the boundary conditions \noffer state constraints at the boundaries of the systems. In the \ncontext of IEGS, the initial conditions define the initial states of \nthe gas pressure and mass flow of the gas pipelines at the \nbeginning of the simulation, as: \n \n(\n)\n( )\n0,\n,\n1,2,\n,\nini\npl\nj\nj\nt\nj\nl,0 =\nl\nL\nj\nJ\nl\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n, \n(1l) \n \n(\n)\n( )\n0,\n,\n1,2,\n,\ninit\npl\nj\nj\nj\nl,0 = m\nl\nl\nL\nj\nJ\nm\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n, \n(1m) \nwherein 𝜋𝑗\n𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 and 𝑚𝑗\n𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 are the initial values of pipeline \npressure and mass flow, respectively. \nThe boundary conditions include the ones of NGN, EPS, and \ncoupling components. For NGN, the boundary conditions \ninclude the gas pressure of gas source nodes and the mass flow \nof load nodes, as: \n \n( )\n( )\nc\nnd\nsrc\nsr\ni\n=\nt\ni\nS\nt\n\n\n\n, \n(1n) \n \n( )\n( )\nd\nnd\nld\nl\ni\nm\n=\nt\nt\ni\nm\nS\n\n, \n(1o) \nwherein 𝜋𝑠𝑟𝑐∈ℝ𝑁𝑠𝑟𝑐 is the known vector of pressure of source \nnodes; 𝑚𝑙𝑜𝑎𝑑∈ℝ𝑁𝑙𝑑 is the known vector of the mass flow of \nload nodes; 𝑁𝑠𝑟𝑐 and 𝑁𝑙𝑑 are the number of source and load \nnodes in NGN, respectively; 𝑆𝑠𝑟𝑐 and 𝑆𝑙𝑑 are the set of source \nand load nodes in NGN, respectively. \nFor EPS, the boundary conditions include the injected active \npower 𝑝𝑃𝑉(𝑡) and voltage amplitude 𝑈𝑃𝑉(𝑡) of PV buses, the \ninjected active power 𝑝𝑃𝑉(𝑡) and reactive power 𝑞𝑃𝑉(𝑡) of PQ \nbuses, and the real parts 𝑒𝑠𝑙𝑘(𝑡) and imaginary 𝑓𝑠𝑙𝑘(𝑡) of the \nvoltage of the slack bus, as: \n \n( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\n,\nb\nPV\nPV\nPV\nb t\nt\np\n= p\nt U\n=U\nt\nb\nS\n\n, \n(1p) \n \n( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\n,\nb\nP\nP\nQ\nQ\nQ\nP\nb t\nt\np\n= p\nt\nq\n= q\nt\nb\nS\n\n, \n(1q) \n \n( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\n,\nb\nslk\nlk\nsl\nb\ns\nk\ne\n=\nt\nt\n= e\nt\nf\nf\nt\nb\nS\n\n, \n(1r) \nwherein 𝑆𝑃𝑉, 𝑆𝑃𝑄, and 𝑆𝑠𝑙𝑘 are the sets of labels for PV, PQ, \nand slack bus, respectively.  \nFurthermore, the boundary conditions for coupling \ncomponents hinge on their respective control strategies. \nElectricity-driven compressors, serving as PQ buses in EPS, \nhave their active and reactive power determined by the mass \nflow through them in NGN via the equation (1i), which remains \nunknown prior to calculation. GTs serving as the slack bus in \nEPS and the load node in NGN have known real and imaginary \nvoltage components. However, their unknown power must be \nderived through power flow calculations, while the mass flow \nof consumed gas is solved using the equation (1j) based on their \n\n\nHuang, et al.

GTs serving as PV buses in EPS and load nodes \nin NGN have known active power and voltage amplitude. The \nmass flow of consumed gas is calculated using the equation (1j) \nbased on their active power, and other unknowns are resolved \nthrough power flow calculations. P2Gs serving as PQ buses in \nEPS and negative load nodes in NGN have known active and \nreactive power. The mass flow of output gas is determined by \nthe equation (1k) based on their active power, with other \nunknowns resolved via power flow calculations. \nC. \nFDM-Based Numerical Algorithm \nThe FDM-based numerical algorithm for the DEF model \nincludes two steps: choosing a difference scheme to discretize \nthe PDEs into AEs and using the iterative method to solve the \nsystem of AEs. In existing work, the commonly-used FDMs for \nthe PDEs of gas flow include the implicit Euler [8] and implicit \ncentral method [21], separately as follows: \n \n,\n1,\n1\n, ,\n1\n,\n1,\n1\n,\n1,\n,\n1,\n1\nj\nj n\nj n\nj\nj n\nj n\nj\nj n\nx\nx\nx\nl\nl\nx\nx\nx\nt\nt\nx\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n, \n(2a) \n \n(\n)\n,\n1,\n1\n, ,\n1\n,\n1,\n, ,\n,\n1,\n1\n,\n1,\n, ,\n1\n, ,\n,\n1,\n1\n, ,\n1\n,\n1,\n, ,\n2\n2\n1\n4\nj\nj n\nj n\nj n\nj n\nj\nj n\nj n\nj n\nj n\nj\nj n\nj n\nj n\nj n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nl\nl\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nt\nt\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n\n−\n+\n−\n\n\n\n\n−\n+\n−\n\n\n\n\n+\n+\n+\n. \n(2b) \nwherein Δ𝑡 and Δ𝑙 indicate the temporal and spatial steps, \nrespectively; 𝜏= 0,1, ⋯, 𝑁𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 and 𝑛= 0,1, ⋯, 𝑁𝑗\n𝑠𝑒𝑔 are the \nindexes of the temporal and spatial segments, respectively; \n𝑁𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 is the number of moments to be simulated; 𝑁𝑗\n𝑠𝑒𝑔 is the \nnumber of differential segments of pipeline 𝑗. \nThe implicit Euler method has 1st order precision with the \ntruncation error 𝑂(𝛥𝑡+ 𝛥𝑥). The implicit central method has \n2nd order precision with the truncation error 𝑂(𝛥𝑡2 + 𝛥𝑥2), \nwhile it has large oscillations. \nUsing the FDM for (1a) and (1b), we can convert the PDEs \ninto AEs. Then, by combining them with the equations (1c)-(1r), \nwe can get the AEs system for the DEF analysis. Next, we need \nto solve the nonlinear AEs, for which the classical method is \nNewton’s method.  \nIII. DIFFERENTIAL TRANSFORMATION OF DEF MODEL \nIn this section, we first introduce the principles and rules of \nDT. Second, we propose the semi-discrete method to transform \nthe PDEs of gas dynamics into ordinary differential equations \n(ODEs), based on which the PDAE system of the DEF model \nis converted into nonlinear ODAEs. Finally, we propose the \nDT-based SA approach for the DEF model. \nA. \nIntroduction of Differential Transformation \nThe DT method converts the nonlinear ODAEs to linear AEs. \nThen, the semi-analytical solutions (SASs) are obtained by \ncalculating the DT coefficients of the unknown variables in the \nnonlinear ODAEs [11]. We start from the generic ODAEs, as: \n \n( )\nMx\nf x\n=\n, \n(3a) \nwherein 𝑥∈ℝ𝑁 are the variables; 𝑓(𝑥): ℝ𝑁→ℝ𝑁 are \n(nonlinear) AEs; 𝑀 is the mass matrix. \nIn this paper, for the variable (⋅), we use (⋅)\n̂[𝑘] to denote its \n𝑘th order DT coefficient.

Hence, we propose to use the semi-\ndiscrete method to transform the PDEs into ODEs. \n1) \nSemi-discrete differences \nWe employ the semi-discrete method [22, 23], also called the \nmethod of lines, to transform PDEs into ODEs. Specifically, for \nthe nonlinear PDEs presented in the equations (1a) and (1b), we \ncan reformulate them into a generalized form as follows: \n \n(\n)\n1,2,\n,\npl\npl\nj\nj\npl\nj\nj\nj\nu\nu\n+V\n= Z\nu\nj\nJ\nt\nl\n\n\n=\n\n\n, \n(4a) \nwherein 𝑢𝑗\n𝑝𝑙= [𝜋𝑗\n𝑝𝑙   𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙]\n⊤; 𝑍𝑗(𝑢𝑗) = [0   −𝜆𝑗𝑐2𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙|𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙| ∕\n(2𝐷𝑗𝑆𝑗𝜋𝑗\n𝑝𝑙)]\n⊤, and \n \n2\n0\n0\nj\nj\nj\nc\nS\nV\nS\n\n\n= \n\n\n\n\n\n. \nThen, we keep the time derivative and only discretize the \nspace derivative term using a central difference scheme [24], as: \n \n,\n1\n,\n1\n1,2,\n,\n1\nj n\nj n\nseg\nj\npl\npl\npl\nju\nu\nu\nn\nN\nl\nl\n+\n−\n\n−\n=\n=\n−\n\n\n. \n(4b) \nBy substituting (4b) into (4a), we have \n \n(\n)\n,\n,\n1\n,\n1\n,\n1,2,\n,\n1\npl\npl\np\nj n\nj n\nj n\nseg\nj\nj\nj\nl\np\nn\nj\nl\ndu\nu\nu\nV\nZ\nu\nn\nN\ndt\nl\n+\n−\n−\n=\n+\n=\n−\n\n.

For pipeline 𝑗 comprising 𝑁𝑗\n𝑠𝑒𝑔 segments, the \n\n\nSubmitted to IEEE Transactions on Power Systems \n \n5\nequations (4b) encompass a total of 2𝑁𝑗\n𝑠𝑒𝑔−2  equations. \nHowever, there are 2𝑁𝑗\n𝑠𝑒𝑔+ 2 variables in these equations. \nEven after accounting for the two boundary conditions at the \nhead and tail of the pipeline, the system remains \nunderdetermined, with fewer equations than unknowns. This \ndiscrepancy arises because the adopted spatial discretization \nscheme utilizes points on both sides to approximate the spatial \npartial derivative of the intermediate point state. To address this \nissue, we propose the numerical boundary conditions. \n2) \nNumerical boundary conditions \nFirst, we perform the eigendecomposition of 𝑉𝑗 in (4a) as \n𝑉𝑗= 𝑣𝑗Λ𝑗𝑣𝑗\n−1, wherein 𝑣𝑗= [𝑐𝑆𝑗\n⁄\n   −𝑐𝑆𝑗\n⁄\n; 1   1].

By Integrating both sides of (4g), \nalong the characteristic line, we have \n \n(\n)\n(\n)\n,1\n,1\n2\n,\n,\n0,1,2,\n4\npl\npl\nj\nj\npl\nj\nj\npl\npl\nj\nj\nj\nj\nt n t\nj\nt\nj\nw\nL t\nn t\nw\nL\nn l t\nm\nm\nc\ndt\nn\nD S\n\n\n+ \n−\n+ \n−\n\n= −\n=\n\n. \n(4h) \nGiven that 𝑤𝑗\n𝑝𝑙,1 is continuous, according to the mean value \ntheorems for integrals, the integral on the right-hand side in (4h) \ncan be expressed as \n \n(\n)\n*\n*\n,\npl\npl\nj\nj\nn\nn\npl\nj\nt\nt n\nt\nm\nm\ndt\nh\nn t\nl t\n\n+ \n=\n\n\n, \n(4i) \nwherein 𝐿𝑗−𝑛∆𝑙≤𝑙𝑛\n∗≤𝐿𝑗; 𝑡≤𝑡𝑛\n∗≤𝑡+ 𝑛∆𝑡; ℎ(𝑙𝑛\n∗, 𝑡𝑛\n∗) ≜\n𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙(𝑙𝑛\n∗, 𝑡𝑛\n∗)|𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙(𝑙𝑛\n∗, 𝑡𝑛\n∗)| 𝜋𝑗\n𝑝𝑙(𝑙𝑛\n∗, 𝑡𝑛\n∗)\n⁄\n. \nHence, (4h) can be written as: \n \n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n2\n,\n*\n1\n,1\n*\n,\n,\n4\n,\nj\npl\npl\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nn\nj\nn\nc\nw\nL t\nn t\nw\nL\nl\nt\nn\nt\nt\nh\nn\nD S\nl\n\n−\n+ \n−\n\n= −\n. (4j) \nSecond, by using the linear interpolation is considered at \n(𝐿𝑗, 𝑡+ 2𝐿(𝑐𝑁𝑖\n𝑠𝑒𝑔)\n⁄\n), we have: \n \n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n,1\n,1\n2\n,1\n,\n2\n2\n,\n,\npl\npl\nj\nj\nj\nj\npl\nj\nj\nw\nL t\nt\nw\nL t\nt\nw\nL t\nO\nt\n+ \n=\n+ \n−\n+\n\n. \n(4k) \nBased on (4j), we get \n \n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n,1\n,1\n,1\n,1\n2\n*\n*\n*\n2\n2\n1\n*\n1\n,\n2\n2\n2\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n2\npl\npl\nj\nj\nj\nj\npl\npl\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nw\nL t\nt\nw\nL\nl t\nw\nL t\nt\nw\nL\nl t\nc\nh l\nh l\nt\nt\nD S\nt\n\n+ \n−\n\n−\n+ \n−\n\n=\n−\n−\n−\n−\n\n. \n(4l) \nTherefore, by combining (4k) and (4l), we have: \n \n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n,1\n,1\n,1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1\n*\n*\n*\n*\n,\n2\n,\n2\n,\n,\n2\n,\npl\npl\npl\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nw\nt\nL\nl t\nw\nL\nl t\nw\nL t\nc\nh l\nh l\nt\nO\nt\nD S\nt\n\n\n−\n\n+\n=\n−\n+\n\n−\n−\n. \n(4m) \nBy expanding ℎ(𝑙2\n∗, 𝑡2\n∗) in a Taylor series at (𝑙1\n∗, 𝑡1\n∗), we have: \n \n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n2\n2\n1\n1\n2\n1\n2\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n1\n*\n,\n,\nh l\nh l\no l\nl\no t\nt\no\nl\no\nt\nt\nt\n−\n−\n+\n=\n−\n=\n\n+\n\n.

Now, the original DEF model of IEGS, (1a)-(1r), \nis transformed into 𝑘-domain system, as given in (5a)-(8c). It \ncan be found that the 𝑘-domain system defines the linear \nrecursive equations of 𝑘th order DT coefficients, i.e., the 𝑘th \norder DT coefficients can be obtained by solving a linear system \nonce the 0th order to (𝑘−1)th order DT coefficients are known. \nTherefore, through the DT-based SA algorithm, once the order \n𝐾 is selected, we can obtain the values of the 𝑘th order DT \ncoefficients from 𝑘= 1 to 𝑘= 𝐾 sequentially by solving the \nlinear equations, and then get the time-domain analytical \nsolutions of unknows based on (3c). \nRemark 3. Note that, if the semi-discrete difference scheme \n(4b) becomes 𝜕𝑢𝑗\n𝑝𝑙𝜕𝑥\n⁄\n= (𝑢𝑗,𝑛\n𝑝𝑙−𝑢𝑗,𝑛−1\n𝑝𝑙\n) Δ𝑥\n⁄\n, the number of \nequations equals the number of unknown variables. However, \nDT of the ODE (4c) in NGN will decouple the pressure and \nmass flow of the gas in these equations, where the only variable \nin each equation is pressure or mass flow, resulting in the \nsingularity of the coefficient matrix of the equation after DT in \nNGN with loop network. \nIV.

We consider the \ncoefficient matrix 𝑊22  for 𝑥̂2[𝑘]  here. To simplify the \ncalculation, only one of the nodes, 𝑖, is considered here. \nConsidering that the pressures are equal at the nodes, we first \nuse 𝜋̂𝑖\n𝑛𝑑,1[𝑘] to eliminate all unknown 𝜋̂ 𝑝𝑙[𝑘] in the equation, \nas: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2,\n2\n,\n,\n11\n,2\n,\n22\n,1\n,1\n1,\n1,\n43\n44\n,\nˆ\nˆ\n1\n,\nˆ\n1\nˆ\nˆ\n,\npl\nout i\npl\nin i\nnd\ni\nnd\ni\nk\ni\ni\ni\nm\nk\nV\nK\nb\nm\nk\nk\nV\nk\nV\nV\nW\nm\nk\nx\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n=\n=\n1\n1\n1\n1\n, \n(9f) \nwherein 𝑉11 is a diagonal matrix whose elements are −𝑐𝑆𝑜𝑖\n⁄\n; \n𝑉22 is a diagonal matrix with elements 𝑐𝑆𝑖𝑖\n⁄\n; 𝑜𝑖 and 𝑖𝑖 denote \nthe labels for all outgoing and incoming pipelines connected to \nnode 𝑖, respectively; 𝑚̂𝑜𝑢𝑡,𝑖\n𝑝𝑙,2 [𝑘] and 𝑚̂𝑖𝑛,𝑖\n𝑝𝑙,2[𝑘] are the unknown \nvectors of the DT coefficients about the mass flow at the head \nor tail of all outgoing and incoming pipelines connected to \nnode 𝑖, respectively; the value of one for 𝑉43 or 𝑉44 indicates \nthat the node serves as a source or load node. \nIf the node has the GT serving as a PV bus in EPS or P2G, \nand its active power is known, its coupling components \nequations (8b) and (8c) are in the same form as the boundary \nconditions of NGN, which can also be written as the fourth row \nin the matrix 𝑊22. Then, we show that 𝑊22 is of full rank. We \nuse the first and second rows in the matrix 𝑊22 to eliminate the \nfirst two row vectors in the left hand of the third row so that \nthe newly formed 𝑉33  is non-zero. Therefore, whether this \nnode is a source node or a load node, the coefficient matrix \n𝑊22 is full rank. \nIn addition, we find that 𝑊22  is only related to the \nparameters given in NGN, and there is no need to update \nduring simulation. \n3) \nStep 3: Calculate the states of coupling nodes and EPS \nby non-iterative method \nNext, the equations 𝐹2,2, 𝐹3,2, 𝐹4 and 𝐹5,2 for EPS and the \nnode with the GT serving as the slack bus in EPS can be written \nas: \n \n\n\n\n31 1\n32\n2\n33\n3\n3\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nk\nk\nW x k\nW x k\nW x k\nb\n+\n+\n=\n \n(9g) \nwhere 𝑥̂1[𝑘] and 𝑥̂2[𝑘] is already solved in the previous steps. \nWe consider the coefficient matrix 𝑊33\n𝑘 for 𝑥̂3[𝑘] here. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n,3\n,3\n,\n2,2\n3,2\n3,2\n4\n4\n2\n4\n5,2\n5,\n3\n3\n2\n1 1\n,3\n,\n,\n32\n2\n2\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n,\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n1,\n,\no\npl\npl\nnd\npl\nd\nC u\nd\ncp\nCou\nn\nk\nn\nu\nk\nu\nk\nu\nk\nu\nk\nu\nk\ne k\nf\nK\nk\nx\ne k\nf\nf\nf\nf\nf\nf\np\np\nf\nf\np\nb\nk\nf k\nk\nu\nk\nk\nW\nk\nW x\nk\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n−\n−\n=\n=\n \n(9h) \n\n\nHuang, et al. Dynamic Energy Flow Analysis of Integrated Electricity and Gas Systems: A Semi-Analytical Approach \n8\nThe first two rows and the last row of 𝑊33\n𝑘 are similar to \nthose of 𝑊22, except that the original boundary conditions are \nchanged into the coupling equations. For the GT serving as the \nslack bus in EPS, its mass flow is calculated by the injected \npower of the bus. For electricity-driven compressors, the \ninjected power of the corresponding bus is calculated from the \npreviously calculated mass flow through the compressor by \n(8a). The third row of 𝑊33\n𝑘 represents the power flow equations \nof EPS. As described in the review, in step 3, the EPS \nequations and NGN nodal equations with the GT serving as the \nslack bus in EPS are integrated through the coupling \ncomponents equations. We increase the equations about the \nactive power flow of the slack bus and the energy flow \nconversion equations of the electricity-driven compressors by \nthe same amount as the number of unknowns for the injected \nactive power of the slack bus and buses with electricity-driven \ncompressors. \nFurthermore, in this step, we find that 𝑊33 is related to the \n0th DT coefficient about EPS, independent of the order 𝑘, and \nonly needs to be updated once in each time window. \nBased on the above matrix partition, we use the non-iterative \ntechnique to solve the problem according to the characteristics \nof IEGS and DT. The simulation process of IEGS DEF by DT \nmethod is shown in Algorithm 1. \nB. \nAdaptive Time Window Control Technique \nTo compute the 0th order DT coefficient for the subsequent \ntime window, we employ the adaptive window control \ntechnique [15], which is an evolution of the stepsize control \nstrategy utilized in the Runge-Kutta method [25]. This \ntechnique dynamically adjusts the time window for each \ncalculation based on the error tolerance we set, thereby \nmitigating the risk of result divergence during significant \nsystem state changes and enhancing simulation robustness. \nAlgorithm 2 outlines the procedure for implementing the \nadaptive time window control technique. Initially, we estimate \nthe truncation error 𝑦̃ of the (𝐾−1)th order DT coefficient \nusing the 𝐾th DT coefficients obtained. Subsequently, we \ndetermine the error tolerance 𝜀 by considering the absolute \ntolerance Atol, relative tolerance Rtol, and the variable values \nwithin the time window. The root mean square error 𝑒𝑟𝑟 is \nthen calculated using 𝑦̃ and 𝜀, and the size of the time window \nis adjusted under the constraint of the change rate. Wherein \n𝑓𝑎𝑐 represents a conservative factor less than one; 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑚𝑎𝑥 \nand 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑚𝑖𝑛 serve as upper and lower bounds to prevent abrupt \nchanges in temporal steps; 𝑦̂[𝐾] denotes the vector containing \nall 𝑁 DT coefficients of the 𝐾th order. \nRemark 4. When calculating the DT coefficients of each \norder for the states between nodes in NGN during step 2, we \nobserve that these coefficients are decoupled by the pipeline \nand do not mutually influence each other. This decoupling \narises because the DT coefficients of the internal state of the \npipeline have already been computed in step 1, thus preventing \nthe nodes from interacting through the pipeline. However, it is \nimportant to note that this decoupling is specific to the \ncalculation of a particular order of the DT coefficient. The \nchanges in the node state variables remain coupled within the \ntime window. This coupling occurs because the computation \nof subsequent order DT coefficients involves the DT \ncoefficient of the internal state of the pipeline, which is \ninfluenced by the DT coefficient at the boundary of pipelines, \nwhich in turn is related to the node state. \nV. CASE STUDIES \nIn this section, the proposed non-iterative method is tested \non two systems: 1) a 50 km single gas pipeline; 2) a 133-node-\n118-bus system. For comparative analysis, the following \nmethods are employed: 1) M1: Characteristic line method \nsolved using Newton’s method, serving as the benchmark for \naccuracy analysis; 2) M2: Implicit Euler difference scheme \nsolved using Newton’s method; M3: Implicit central \ndifference scheme solved using Newton’s method; M4: DT \nmethod with 5th order.  \nIn the first system, we demonstrate the superior accuracy of \nthe proposed method compared to the numerical methods. In \nthe second system, we validate the increased computational \nefficiency of the proposed method over the numerical methods. \nAll tests are conducted using Python 3.11.9 on a computer with \nan Intel i9-13900K CPU and 96 GB of RAM. \n\n\nSubmitted to IEEE Transactions on Power Systems \n \n9\nA. \nA 50km Single Gas Pipeline System \nThe single gas pipeline system comprises a pipeline linking \nthe source and load nodes [3]. The source node pressure is \nfixed at 300 kPa, whereas the load mass flow varies: it \ndecreases from 1.2 kg/s to 0.8 kg/s when time reaches 0.5 \nhours, then increases to 2 kg/s at 1.5 hours, and decreases \ngradually after 2 hours.  \nThe results obtained from M1 are utilized as reference data \nto assess the accuracy of M2-M4. A uniform spatial step of 1 \nkm is adopted for all simulations. For M2 and M3, the tests are \nperformed at temporal steps of 180 seconds and 9 seconds. The \nadaptive time window control technique is employed in M4 to \nensure that the temporal step yields the results within the \nacceptable error tolerance, thereby enhancing the robustness of \nthe proposed method against significant disturbances. \nAs we can see from Fig. 2, the results obtained by M2 and \nM3 with a small temporal step and M4 are close to the \nreference data generated by M1, indicating the high accuracy \nachieved by these methods. In contrast, M2 and M3 with a \nlarger temporal step exhibit a more significant error. Table I \npresents    h m th  ’s    t m    sq          s (RM Es) \ncompared to the reference data to quantify the accuracy \ndifferences. This quantitative assessment yields a notable \nobservation: Numerical methods require considerably smaller \ntemporal steps to attain accuracy levels comparable to M4. \nAlthough refining the temporal discretization enhances \naccuracy, it substantially increases computational costs and \nexecution time, rendering it challenging for real-time \napplications or large-scale simulations. Consequently, M4 \nstands out as an effective and practical choice for addressing \ncomplex integrated energy network problems, owing to its \ninherent ability to maintain high accuracy. \nB. \nA 133-node & 118-bus System \nThe effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are \nvalidated in a large-scale system, which is an improved system \nof the 133-node NGN and IEEE 118-bus EPS from [26, 27]. \nThe coupling components in the system consist of 5 GTs, a \nP2G, and an electricity-driven compressor. Specifically, the \nGT serving as the slack bus at bus 69 in EPS is supported by \nNGN at node 89. The remaining 4 GTs, serving as PV buses at \nbuses 10, 12, 49, and 61 in EPS, are supported by NGN at \nnodes 133, 130, 90, and 98, respectively. The P2G at node 79 \nin NGN is supplied by EPS at bus 59, and the electricity-driven \ncompressor at node 84 in NGN is powered by EPS at bus 114. \nUtilizing the results obtained from M1 with a spatial step of \n500 m as a baseline, the calculation accuracy and speed of \nmethods M2-M4 are evaluated under the same spatial step of \n1000 m.  \nAs shown in Fig. 3, M2-M4 effectively capture the dynamic \nchanges in mass flow and pressure in NGN, and voltage \n(a) \n(b) \nFig. 2.

Dynamic Energy Flow Analysis of Integrated Electricity and Gas Systems: A Semi-Analytical Approach \n10 \ndistribution in EPS. Particularly for the mass flow and pressure \nstates in NGN, the results of M2 and M3 with smaller temporal \nsteps and M4 exhibit good agreement with the reference results. \nHowever, M2 and M3 with a large temporal step deviate \nsubstantially when the system boundary changes significantly. \nWe can find from Table II that the calculation accuracy of M4 \nin EPS is comparable to that of M2 and M3. Notably, the \naccuracy of M4 in NGN surpasses that of M2 and M3 with \nsimilar temporal steps. Furthermore, despite M3 with 2nd \norder precision in the difference scheme, numerical \noscillations occur during the simulation process, leading to \nlower mass flow calculation accuracy than M2 with 1st order \nprecision. \nAs presented in Table III, a comparative analysis of the \ncomputational cost among multiple methods reveals further \nadvantages of M4 over numerical methods such as M2 and M3. \nThe advantage of M4 lies in its utilization of recursive \ncalculations and linear equation solving, eliminating the \nrequirement for iterative solutions. As a result, when using \ncomparable temporal steps, M2 and M3 demonstrate longer \ntotal calculation times than the proposed M4. Previous \nfindings show that M2 and M3 require considerably smaller \ntemporal steps to achieve an accuracy level comparable to M4. \nFurthermore, it is well-established that, for the given method, \ncalculation time is directly proportional to the number of \ncalculation steps and inversely proportional to the size of the \ntemporal step. This relationship further confirms the superior \ncomputational efficiency of the proposed M4 method.  \nVI. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we have addressed the challenges associated \nwith DEF simulation in IEGS by proposing a novel non-\niterative SA method based on DT. Our method achieves high \naccuracy with a small computational cost by leveraging the \nrecursive properties of DT. Simulation results demonstrate the \neffectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. \nREFERENCES \n[1] J. Wu, J.

    "abstract": "Ensuring the safe and reliable operation of integrated electricity and gas\nsystems (IEGS) requires dynamic energy flow (DEF) simulation tools that achieve\nhigh accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the inherent strong\nnonlinearity of gas dynamics and its bidirectional coupling with power grids\nimpose significant challenges on conventional numerical algorithms,\nparticularly in computational efficiency and accuracy. Considering this, we\npropose a novel non-iterative semi-analytical algorithm based on differential\ntransformation (DT) for DEF simulation of IEGS. First, we introduce a\nsemi-discrete difference method to convert the partial differential algebraic\nequations of the DEF model into ordinary differential algebraic equations to\nresort to the DT. Particularly, by employing spatial central difference and\nnumerical boundary extrapolation, we effectively avoid the singularity issue of\nthe DT coefficient matrix. Second, we propose a DT-based semi-analytical\nsolution method, which can yield the solution of the DEF model by recursion.\nFinally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.",
