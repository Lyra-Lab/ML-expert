Given an axially-symmetric, (n + 1)-dimensional convex cone Ω⊂Rn+1, we study\nthe stability of the free-boundary minimal surface Σ obtained by intersecting Ωwith a n-plane\nthat contains the axis of Ω.\nIn the case n = 2, Σ is always unstable, as a special case of\nthe vertex-skipping property recently proved in [16]. Conversely, as soon as n ≥3 and Ωhas a\nsuﬃciently large aperture (depending on the dimension n), we show that Σ is strictly stable. For\nour stability analysis, we introduce a Lipschitz ﬂow Σt[f] of deformations of Σ associated with a\ncompactly-supported, scalar deformation ﬁeld f, which satisﬁes the key property ∂Σt[f] ⊂∂Ω\nfor all t ∈R. Then, we compute the lower-right second variation of the area of Σ along the ﬂow,\nand ultimately show that it is positive by exploiting its connection with a functional inequality\nstudied in the context of reaction-diﬀusion problems.\n1. Introduction\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of the theory of free-boundary minimal surfaces, and more\ngenerally of capillary surfaces, is their behaviour near the boundary of their container. A well-\nestablished regularity theory is known to hold when the free boundary of a minimal surface Σ\nmeets a regular point of the boundary of its container Ω(see [4, 8]); in this case the 90-degree\ncontact-angle law (or, more generally, Young’s law for capillary surfaces [19]) holds true in a\nclassical sense. Conversely, the behaviour of Σ near a generic point of ∂Σ ∩∂sΩ, where ∂sΩ\ndenotes the set of singular points of ∂Ω, is much less known. Few exceptions are represented by\nthe studies on free-boundary minimal surfaces in 3-dimensional wedge domains, mainly due to\nHildebrandt-Sauvigny [10–13], and by the analogous studies pursued in the context of capillary\nsurfaces, see e.g. [7,14] and the references therein).\nA few years ago, Edelen-Li [5] extended the existing regularity theory by proving a very general\nε-regularity theorem for free-boundary integral varifolds with bounded mean curvature in locally-\nalmost-polyhedral domains. Subsequently, with the aim of pushing the regularity theory forward\nand beyond the locally almost-polyhedral class, in a couple of recent works we have shown some\nsort of complementary results in the context of sets of ﬁnite perimeter. The ﬁrst result is a\nfree-boundary monotonicity formula for perimeter almost-minimizers in a non-smooth domain\n2020 Mathematics Subject Classiﬁcation. Primary: 49Q05.

The second is a vertex-skipping property for\nalmost-minimal boundaries in convex sets [16], which can be coupled with [5] and lead to a full,\nfree-boundary regularity result for 2-dimensional integral varifolds with bounded mean curvature\nin locally almost-polyhedral 3d-domains.\nBlow-up techniques are among the main tools used to retrieve information on the (boundary)\nproperties of Σ at various levels (local structure, density properties, and ultimately regular-\nity). Relying on boundary monotonicity formulas (see [15]) one can blow-up an almost-minimal\n(almost-minimizing) surface at one of its free-boundary points, obtaining free-boundary minimal\n(area-minimizing) cones inside conical domains (like, e.g., wedges). This is the ﬁrst step of the\nprocedure we have followed in [16] to show via a contradiction argument the vertex-skipping\nproperty, i.e., that the internal boundary Σ of a perimeter almost-minimizer in a convex set\nΩ⊂R3 avoids all vertices of ∂Ω1.\nIt is then natural to ask whether the vertex-skipping property is a special feature of the 3-\ndimensional setting, or if instead it holds true in any dimension. To answer this question we\nconsider here a n-plane in Rn+1 containing the axis of a convex circular (n + 1)-cone, and study\nthe stability of the free-boundary minimal surface obtained intersecting the plane with the cone.\nMore precisely, we take 0 < λ < ∞and n ≥2, then let x′ = (x1, . . . , xn−1) and set\nΩλ :=\n\b\n(x1, ..., xn−1, xn, xn+1) ∈Rn+1 : xn > ωλ(x′, xn+1)\n\t\n,\nwhere ωλ(x′, xn+1) = λ\nq\n|x′|2 + x2\nn+1. Then, we deﬁne\nΣ = {x ∈Ωλ : xn+1 = 0} .\nIn Section 3 we prove the core result of the paper, namely, that when n ≥4 there exists a\nthreshold aperture parameter 0 < λ∗< 1 depending on the dimension n, such that, for all\n0 < λ ≤λ∗, the n-plane Σ is a strictly stable free-boundary minimal surface in Ωλ. Conversely,\nin the case n = 2 one can check the instability of Σ for all 0 < λ < 1, as a consequence of either\na direct computation (that we present for completeness) or of the more general vertex-skipping\ntheorem proved in [16]. The diﬀerent (and, at ﬁrst sight, quite unexpected) stability properties\nof Σ have a correspondence in some literature on minimal surfaces within cones. In particular,\na result of Morgan [17] implies that the free-boundary ∂Σ is an area-minimizing (n −1)-surface\nin ∂Ωλ as soon as n ≥4 and λ is small enough. Similar results are also available for some\nfree-boundary problems of Alt-Caﬀarelli type [1], where the dimension n = 3 is critical for the\nfree-boundary to either avoid or contain the tip of a circular cone domain, again according to\nthe aperture of the cone.\nGoing back to [17], its main result is based on a calibration argument that holds precisely\nwhen n ≥4. For this reason, we expect that our strict stability result can be improved to a full\narea-minimizing result at least when n ≥4. However, the same kind of analysis in the case n = 3\nseems harder, as it is not fully clear whether ∂Σ is unstable, or at least not area-minimizing,\nin ∂Ωλ. We limit to notice that our result seems to support the conjecture that Σ is locally\narea-minimizing also when n = 3. We thus plan to focus on the area-minimization property of\nthe free-boundary plane Σ in Ωλ in a forthcoming work.\n1A point x ∈∂Ωis called vertex if the tangent cone to Ωat x does not contain full lines.\n\n\nSTABILITY OF AXIAL FREE-BOUNDARY HYPERPLANES...\n3\n1.1. Organization of the paper. In Section 2 we introduce some essential notation and con-\nstruct a one-parameter family Σt of free-boundary perturbations of the plane Σ generated by a\nscalar ﬁeld f deﬁned on Σ. Instead of assuming that the support of f does not contain the origin\n(i.e., the tip of Σ) and then couple a standard one-parameter normal ﬂow construction with\nsuitable capacitary considerations, we consider for possible later uses an alternative construction\nof a local ﬂow of bi-Lipschitz omomorphisms in a generic domain Ωwith Lipschitz boundary,\nwhich sends ∂Ωinto itself. In particular, if applied to the circular cone Ωλ, this ﬂow is allowed\nto move the tip of Σ. Consequently, ﬁrst and second lower-right variations of the area of Σ are\nintroduced for being used in the next section.\nSection 3 contains the main computations and results of the paper. In Lemma 3.1 we expand\nthe Jacobian appearing in the deﬁnition of the area of Σt, in terms of an explicit expression\ndepending on f and its (tangential) gradient ∇f, up to a remainder term that we need to control\nwith suitably uniform estimates. Then, after observing the nullity of the ﬁrst right-lower variation\nof the area, we compute the second lower-right variation and observe that its positivity depends\non a functional relation called Kato inequality, that is known in the context of reaction-diﬀusion\nproblems and allows us to complete the proof of our main result, Theorem 3.4.\nFinally, in the Appendix we prove the technical lemma used in the computation of the Jacobian\nexpansion of Lemma 3.1.\n2. Notations and basic constructions\nLet n ≥2 be a given integer. Given x ∈Rn and t ∈R, we deﬁne ˜x = (x, t) ∈Rn+1 and\nx′ ∈Rn−1 such that x = (x′, xn), with a slight abuse of notation. We identify x with (x, 0) ∈Rn+1\nand x′ with (x′, 0, 0) ∈Rn+1, whenever this does not create confusion. We denote by ˜Br(˜x) the\nopen ball of radius r > 0 centered at ˜x, and we set ˜Br := ˜Br(0). For any 1 ≤i ≤n+1, we denote\nby pi the hyperplane of Rn+1 of equation xi = 0, and use the same notation for the orthogonal\nprojection of Rn+1 onto this hyperplane. Given a diﬀerentiable function f : Rn+1 →R, we\ndenote the partial derivative of f with respect to xi as ∂if.\nWe now construct one-parameter families of compact deformations of a ﬁxed, n-dimensional\nhyperplane Σ restricted to a Lipschitz epigraph Ω. The deformations are deﬁned on Ωand are\n“tangential”, in the sense that they send ∂Ωinto itself.\nSpeciﬁcally, given a Lipschitz function ω = ω(x′, t) : Rn →R, we let\nΩ= {˜x = (x′, xn, t) ∈Rn+1 : xn > ω(x′, t)} .\n(2.1)\nWe also let Σ := Ω∩pn+1 and set ∂Σ = Σ ∩∂Ω. Given x = (x′, xn) ∈Σ, we consider the\nparametric curve Γx : R →Rn+1 deﬁned as\nΓx(t) := (x′, xn + ω(x′, t) −ω(x′, 0), t)\n(2.2)\nand, with a slight abuse of notation, we identify Γx with Γx(R).\nThe next lemma collects some key properties of the family {Γx : x ∈Σ}.\nLemma 2.1. The family of parametric curves {Γx :\nx ∈Σ} deﬁnes a foliation of Ω. More\nprecisely, the following properties hold:\n(i) Γx(0) = x and Γx ⊂Ω, for all x ∈Σ;\n(ii) if x ̸= y ∈Σ then Γx ∩Γy = ∅;\n(iii) Γx(t) ∈∂Ωfor some t ∈R if and only if Γx ⊂∂Ω.\n\n\n4\nGIAN PAOLO LEONARDI AND GIACOMO VIANELLO\n(iv) the map (x, t) 7→Γx(t) is Lipschitz.\nProof. Property (i) directly follows from the deﬁnition of Γx and by observing that x ∈Σ implies\nxn ≥ω(x′, 0), hence\nxn + ω(x′, t) −ω(x′, 0) ≥ω(x′, t) .\nThen, concerning property (ii), if Γx(t) = Γy(u) for some x, y ∈Σ and some t, u ∈R, by deﬁnition\nwe must have t = u, x′ = y′, and\nxn + (ω(x′, t) −ω(x′, 0)) = yn + (ω(y′, u) −ω(y′, 0)) ,\nwhich implies xn = yn and hence x = y, which proves (ii). The less obvious implication of (iii)\nis the only if part: if Γx(t) ∈∂Ωfor some t ∈R, then\nxn + ω(x′, t)) −ω(x′, 0)) = ω(x′, t) ,\ni.e., xn = ω(x′, 0). Consequently,\nΓx(u) = (x′, ω(x′, 0) + ω(x′, u) −ω(x′, 0), u) = (x′, ω(x′, u), u) ∈∂Ω\nfor all u ∈R. Finally, the proof of (iv) easily follows from the estimate\n|Γx(t) −Γy(u)| ≤|x′ −y′| + |xn −yn| + |ω(x′, t) −ω(y′, u)| + |ω(x′, 0) + ω(y′, 0)| + |t −u|\n≤(1 + 2Lip(ω))(|x′ −y′| + |xn −yn| + |t −u|).\n□\nLet now f : Σ →R be a Lipschitz function with compact support in Σ. We deﬁne the ﬂow\nassociated to f as\nΦ[f](x, t) := Γx(tf(x))\n(2.3)\nfor all (x, t) ∈Σ × R. The map Φ[f] satisﬁes Φ[f](x, t) = x and, thanks to Lemma 2.1, it\nis Lipschitz and one-to-one. When Φ[f](·, t) is diﬀerentiable at x (which is true for almost all\nx ∈Σ), we denote by\nDΦ[f](x, t) = (∂1Φ[f](x, t), . . . , ∂nΦ[f](x, t))\nthe Jacobian matrix of Φ[f](·, t) at x, and by DΦ[f](x, t)T its transpose. We also deﬁne\nS[f](x, t) := DΦ[f](x, t)T · DΦ[f](x, t)\nand\nJ[f](x, t) :=\np\ndet(S[f](x, t)) ,\nand note for future reference that\nJ[f](x, 0) = 1\n∀x ∈Σ .\n(2.4)\nThen, we deﬁne\nΣt[f] = Φ[f](Σ, t)\nand\nA[f](t) := Hn(Φ[f](Σ ∩spt f, t)) =\nZ\nspt f\nJ[f](x, t) dx ,\nwhere the second identity follows from the Area Formula (see, e.g., [2, Theorem 2.91]). The\nfunction A[f](t) represents the area of the compact portion of the hyperplane Σ deformed via\nthe ﬂow map Φ[f](·, t). The minimality/stability of Σ is related to the asymptotic properties of\nA[f](t) when t →0. In general, we cannot expect that A[f](t) is (twice) diﬀerentiable at t = 0,\n\n\nSTABILITY OF AXIAL FREE-BOUNDARY HYPERPLANES...\n5\nhence it will not be possible to compute the ﬁrst and second variations of the area in a classical\nsense. However, we can test the local minimality of Σ by taking lower right variations, i.e.,\n∂tA[f](0+) := lim inf\nt→0+\nA[f](t) −A[f](0)\nt\nand, assuming ∂tA[f](0+) = 0,\n∂2\nt A[f](0+) := 2 lim inf\nt→0+\nA[f](t) −A[f](0)\nt2\n.\nTherefore, a ﬁrst-order necessary condition for local minimality is\n∂tA[f](0+) ≥0 ,\n∀f ∈C0,1\nc (Σ) ,\n(2.5)\nwith strict inequality only if the local minimality is strict.\nThen, a second-order necessary\ncondition is\n∂tA[f](0+) = 0\n=⇒\n∂2\nt A[f](0+) ≥0 ,\n(2.6)\nfor all f ∈C0,1\nc (Σ).\n3. Stability of Σ in Ωλ\nWe recall that Ωλ is the (n + 1)-dimensional circular cone deﬁned as the epigraph of the\nfunction\nωλ(x′, xn+1) := λ\nq\n|x′|2 + x2\nn+1 ,\nwith λ > 0 a ﬁxed parameter deﬁning the aperture of the cone. In this case, for all f ∈C0,1\nc (Σ),\nthe one-parameter ﬂow associated with f is given by\nΦ[f](x, t) :=\n\u0000x′ , ωλ(x′, tf(x)) + xn −ωλ(x′, 0) , t f(x)\n\u0001\n=\n\u0010\nx′ , λ\np\n|x′|2 + t2f(x)2 + xn −λ|x′| , t f(x)\n\u0011\n.\nIt is immediate to check that Φ[f](x, t) is diﬀerentiable on the set\n∆f := {x ∈spt f : x ̸= 0 , f is diﬀerentiable at x} ∪(Σ \\ spt f) .\nIn particular, since f is Lipschitz, we infer that\nHn(Σ \\ ∆f) = 0 .\nFor almost all x ∈∆f and for 1 ≤i ≤n −1, we have\n∂iΦ[f](x, t) = ei +\n\u0002\nt ∂if(x) ∂n+1ωλ(x′, tf(x)) + ∂iωλ(x′, tf(x)) −∂iωλ(x′, 0)\n\u0003\nen + t ∂if(x)en+1\n= ei + λ\n \nt2f(x) ∂if(x)\np\n|x′|2 + t2f(x)2 +\nxi\np\n|x′|2 + t2f(x)2 −xi\n|x|\n!\nen + t ∂if(x)en+1\n(3.1)\nwhile, if i = n,\n∂nΦ[f](x, t) =\n\u0000t ∂nf(x) ∂n+1ωλ(x′, tf(x)) + 1\n\u0001\nen + t ∂nf(x)en+1\n=\n \nλ t2f(x) ∂nf(x)\np\n|x′|2 + t2f(x)2 + 1\n!\nen + t ∂nf(x)en+1 .\n(3.2)\n\n\n6\nGIAN PAOLO LEONARDI AND GIACOMO VIANELLO\nWe introduce the following notations:\nαi(x, t) :=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nλ\n \nt2f(x) ∂if(x)\np\n|x′|2 + t2f(x)2 +\nxi\np\n|x′|2 + t2f(x)2 −xi\n|x|\n!\nif i = 1, ..., n −1\nλ\nt2f(x)∂nf(x)\np\n|x′|2 + t2f(x)2\nif i = n ,\n(3.3)\nβi(x, t) := t ∂if(x) ,\n∀i = 1, ..., n .\n(3.4)\nWe thus have\n∂iΦ[f](x, t) = ei + αi(x, t) en + βi(x, t) en+1 ,\n∀i = 1, ..., n .\n(3.5)\nLemma 3.1.

Indeed, we\ncan prove that there exists a threshold aperture parameter λ∗> 0, such that for larger apertures\n(i.e., for 0 < λ ≤λ∗), the hyperplane Σ becomes strictly stable.\nTheorem 3.4. Let n ≥3. Then there exists λ∗= λ∗(n) > 0 such that, if 0 < λ ≤λ∗, we have\n∂sA[f](0+) ≥0\nfor all f ∈C0,1\nc (Σ)\n(3.15)\nand the inequality is strict whenever f is not identically zero, which means that Σ is strictly\nstable.\nTo prove Theorem 3.4, we need the following result.\nLemma 3.5. Let n ≥3. Then\nZ\nΣ\n|∇f(x)|2 dx ≥\nKn\n(1 + λ)2\nZ\nRn−1\nf(x′, λ|x′|)2\n|x′|\ndx′ ,\nfor all f ∈H1(Σ),\n(3.16)\nwhere Kn = 2Γ2(n/4)Γ−2((n −2)/4) and Γ(u) is Euler’s Gamma function.\nInequality (3.16) is known as Kato’s Inequality. A proof of a stronger version of (3.16), valid\nwhen Σ is a half-space (i.e. for λ = 0), is provided in [3, Theorem 1.4]. Although our domain\nΣ is not a half-space, our version directly follows from inequality (9) in the same work. We also\nmention that a former proof of Kato’s Inequality was given by Herbst in [9].\nProof of Lemma 3.5. Let us denote by Rn\n+ the half-space of points x ∈Rn with xn > 0. Inequal-\nity (9) of [3] states that\nZ\nRn\n+\n|∇g(x)|2 dx ≥Kn\nZ\nRn−1\ng(x′, 0)2\n|x′|\ndx′ ,\nfor all g ∈H1(Rn\n+).\n(3.17)\nGiven f ∈H1(Σ), let us set\nT(x) := (x′, xn + λ|x′|),\ng(x) := f(T(x)) .\n\n\n10\nGIAN PAOLO LEONARDI AND GIACOMO VIANELLO\nWe have g ∈H1(Rn\n+). Since g(x′, 0) = f(x′, λ|x′|), we get\nZ\nRn−1\ng(x′, 0)2\n|x′|\ndx′ =\nZ\nRn−1\nf(x′, λ|x′|)2\n|x′|\ndx′ .\n(3.18)\nWe observe that\n∇g(x) = ∇f(T(x)) + λ∂nf(T(x))\n\u0012 x′\n|x′|, 0\n\u0013\n,\nand thus\n|∇g(x)|2 ≤(1 + λ)2|∇f(T(x))|2 .\n(3.19)\nCombining (3.17), (3.18) and (3.19), and noting that det DT ≡1, by the change of variable\nformula we get\n(1 + λ)2\nZ\nΣ\n|∇f(x)|2dx = (1 + λ)2\nZ\nRn\n+\n|∇f(T(x))|2dx\n≥\nZ\nRn\n+\n|∇g(x)|2dx\n≥Kn\nZ\nRn−1\nf(x′, λ|x′|)2\n|x′|\ndx′\nand conclude the proof.\n□\nProof of Theorem 3.4. By Lemma 3.5, the validity of (3.13), for all f ∈C0,1\nc (Σ), is guaranteed\nby the condition\n0 < λ ≤\nKn\n(1 + λ)2 .\n(3.20)\nSince the function λ 7→λ(1+λ)2 is monotonically increasing from 0 to +∞, there exists a unique\nλ∗> 0 such that\nλ∗(1 + λ∗)2 = Kn\nand, consequently, (3.20) is satisﬁed if and only if 0 < λ ≤λ∗, as wanted.\n□\nAppendix A.\nLet v1, ..., vk ∈Rn+1 and denote by S[v1, ..., vk] the k × k symmetric matrix which elements\nare the scalar products ⟨vi, vj⟩, for 1 ≤i, j ≤k. By applying the deﬁnition of determinant and\nthe Cauchy-Binet Formula (see, e.g., [18, Chapter 2]) it is immediate to show that\ndet(S[v1, ..., vk]) = |v1 ∧... ∧vk|2 ,\n(A.1)\nwhere ∧denotes the wedge-product of v1, ..., vk (we refer to [6] for a formal deﬁnition of ∧\nand its main properties). We limit to mention that ∧is alternating, i.e. v1 ∧... ∧vk vanishes\nwhenever vi = vj, for some i ̸= j. Moreover, the wedge products v1 ∧... ∧vk form a linear vector\nspace, usually denoted by Vk Rn+1. If e1, ..., en+1 denote the canonical basis of Rn+1, then the\nwedge products ei1 ∧... ∧eik, for all 1 ≤i1 < ... < ik ≤n + 1, form a basis of Vk Rn+1. We\nassume that Vk Rn+1 is endowed with the unique scalar product such that ei1 ∧... ∧eik, for\n1 ≤i1 < ... < ik ≤n + 1, are orthonormal. The norm associated with this scalar product is\ndenoted by | · |.\n\n\nSTABILITY OF AXIAL FREE-BOUNDARY HYPERPLANES...\n11\nLet us introduce some convenient notation. We let α = (α1, . . . , αk) be a multi-index with αℓ∈\n{1, . . . , n+1}. Then, we set eα = eα1 ∧· · · ∧eαk and, given i ∈{1, . . . , k} and j ∈{1, . . . , n+1},\nwe deﬁne\nej\nα,i = eα1 ∧· · · ∧eαi−1 ∧ej ∧eαi+1 ∧· · · ∧eαk\nLemma A.1. For i = 1, ..., n, let vi = ei +Ai en +Bi en+1, where Ai, Bi are real numbers. Then\ndet(S[v1, ..., vn]) = (1 + An)2\n \n1 +\nn−1\nX\ni=1\nB2\ni\n!\n+B2\nn\n \n1 +\nn−1\nX\ni=1\nA2\ni\n!\n−2 (1+An)Bn\nn−1\nX\ni=1\nAiBi . (A.2)\nProof. Let us set α = (1, 2, . . . , n −1). By deﬁnition of vn, using the alternating property of the\nwedge product and the fact that en\nα,i ∧en+1 = −en+1\nα,i ∧en, we get\nv1 ∧... ∧vn = (1 + An) eα ∧en + Bn eα ∧en+1 +\n(A.3)\n+ Bn\nn−1\nX\ni=1\nAi en\nα,i ∧en+1 + (1 + An)\nn−1\nX\ni=1\nBi en+1\nα,i ∧en\n= (1 + An) eα ∧en + Bn eα ∧en+1 +\nn−1\nX\ni=1\n[BnAi −(1 + An) Bi] en\nα,i ∧en+1 .\nBy the orthonormality of the wedge products eα∧en, eα∧en+1, and en\nα,i∧en+1 for i = 1, . . . , n−1,\nwe obtain\n|v1 ∧... ∧vn|2 = (1 + An)2\n \n1 +\nn−1\nX\ni=1\nB2\ni\n!\n+ B2\nn\n \n1 +\nn−1\nX\ni=1\nA2\ni\n!\n−2 (1 + An)Bn\nn−1\nX\ni=1\nAiBi .\nThen (A.2) immediately follows from (A.1).\n□\nReferences\n[1] Mark Allen.

    "abstract": "Given an axially-symmetric, $(n+1)$-dimensional convex cone $\\Omega\\subset\n\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, we study the stability of the free-boundary minimal surface\n$\\Sigma$ obtained by intersecting $\\Omega$ with a $n$-plane that contains the\naxis of $\\Omega$. In the case $n=2$, $\\Sigma$ is always unstable, as a special\ncase of the vertex-skipping property recently proved in a paper by the same\nauthors. Conversely, as soon as $n \\ge 3$ and $\\Omega$ has a sufficiently large\naperture (depending on the dimension $n$), we show that $\\Sigma$ is strictly\nstable. For our stability analysis, we introduce a Lipschitz flow\n$\\Sigma_{t}[f]$ of deformations of $\\Sigma$ associated with a\ncompactly-supported, scalar deformation field $f$, which satisfies the key\nproperty $\\partial \\Sigma_{t}[f] \\subset \\partial \\Omega$ for all $t\\in\n\\mathbb{R}$. Then, we compute the lower-right second variation of the area of\n$\\Sigma$ along the flow, and ultimately show that it is positive by exploiting\nits connection with a functional inequality studied in the context of\nreaction-diffusion problems.",
