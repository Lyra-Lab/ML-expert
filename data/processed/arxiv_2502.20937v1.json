Making these collections robust\nand reusable is not trivial, partly because of the inherent subjec-\ntivity of relevance [45]. Assessing the reliability of relevance judg-\nments involves assessing inter-annotator agreement and is com-\nparably expensive [4, 23, 46]. Consequently, only a few studies\nhave investigated how the variability of relevance judgments af-\nfects the evaluation of retrieval systems. However, those findings\nwere highly important for the design of retrieval test collections as\nthey showed that even when relevance is subjective and therefore\nannotators disagree [38, 42], subsequent aggregated effectiveness\nevaluations [4, 23] and system rankings [46] are stable, ensuring\nthe reusability of test collections.\nContrasting older collections, topics in modern test collections\noften do not have descriptions or narratives, which is known to\naffect agreement [33], documents are often shorter, and relevance\nis assessed on a graded scale, which has not been investigated in\nre-annotation studies. Table 1 contrasts previous studies and the\nproperties of the corresponding test collections with the TREC Deep\nLearning 2019 [8] (DL‚Äô19) test collection we use in our reproducibil-\nity work. The changes in modern collections potentially increase\nassessment variability because an assessor can freely interpret the\nquery intent and context that may be missing from the document to\nassess its relevance on a fine-grained scale. In this reproducibility\nstudy, we investigate if the robustness of classical test collections\nstill holds for modern test collections under these new conditions.\nThese shifts in test collection design coincide with advances\nin retrieval methodologies; retrieval pipelines increasingly com-\nprise components where neural language models estimate rele-\nvance. These systems have continuously improved over multiple\narXiv:2502.20937v1  [cs.IR]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\nSIGIR ‚Äô25, July 13‚Äì18, 2024, Padua, Italy\nA. Parry et al.\niterations through improved training processes [31], through dis-\ntillation from large language models [32, 40], or by directly using\nlarge language models for ranking [43]. We hypothesize that iter-\native model improvements on static benchmarks may overfit to\nthe specific opinions expressed in static relevance judgements, in-\ntroducing systemic bias, which can be characterized as ‚Äúbias by\nresearch design‚Äù in which the influence of previous works can bias\nnew findings implicitly towards a common benchmark [18]. The\nTREC DL‚Äô19 track remains a commonly used standard for bench-\nmarking systems, being cited and most likely evaluated hundreds\nof times (Cited 32 times at ECIR‚Äô24 and SIGIR‚Äô24 alone). Craswell\net al. [9] alluded to this point, warning against the iterative design\nprocesses employed in ad-hoc neural ranking.\nThus, we look to replicate the classic setting for evaluating the\nrobustness of collections proposed by Voorhees [46] for modern\ncollections, with the additional hypothesis that bias in the system\norderings may be introduced through model iteration instead of\nhuman disagreement. Since a single expert human assessor‚Äôs rele-\nvance grades on a given topic are subjective and ‚Äúequally plausible‚Äù\nas another assessor‚Äôs, we can compare the effectiveness of systems\nusing multiple ‚Äúequally correct‚Äù sets of relevance judgments. If\na system‚Äôs relative effectiveness degrades when evaluated using\nalternative judgments, it may indicate that models overfit the pref-\nerences expressed by the collection‚Äôs official judgments.\nIn this paper, we conduct a re-annotation of TREC DL‚Äô19 using\ntwo ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù annotators for every topic. Based on our new rel-\nevance judgments, we first provide a qualitative analysis of this\nprocess and validate the findings of previous work in a modern\nsetting. That is, we observe low agreement among assessors but sys-\ntem rankings remain stable. Secondly, treating human annotators\nas manual TREC runs, we find that one can no longer meaning-\nfully discriminate between the state-of-the-art and human judges\non this collection. A reasonable ‚Äúupper bound‚Äù effectiveness is\naround nDCG@10 of 0.81 (due to the assessment ambiguity). We\nsuggest that reported results that are higher than this bound on\nDL‚Äô19 might already overfit to the relevance labels. Note that we\nare not aware of any existing system reporting results exceeding\nthis bound.1 However, the leading systems today are very close,\nwith RankZephyr [32] and RankGPT [43] reaching between 0.78‚Äì\n0.80 nDCG@10 with a sufficiently strong first stage. We additionally\nfind that closed-sourced large language models and systems dis-\ntilled from them can fluctuate greatly in relative effectiveness, often\ndegrading system rank on our new relevance judgments.\nOur reproducibility effort spawned from the ECIR 2024 Collab-\na-thon on Neural IR [24]. A subset of the IR community discussed\nthat the current generation of retrieval models may have reached\na practical upper bound on existing test collections, but we were\nunsure when to consider a test collection to be saturated or expired.\nOur study reproduced prior findings on the inherent subjectivity\nand variability of relevance judgments (especially in the absence\nof a well-defined narrative), and it established an empirical upper\nbound on TREC DL‚Äô19. Therefore, we encourage caution when\nattempting to maximize a given metric as we approach and exceed\nhuman bounds on relevance estimation. Exceeding human effec-\ntiveness, given the subjectivity of relevance, may not lead to an\n1We do not consider large ensemble systems, given their risks [2].\noptimal system but instead stagnation of progress in the field. We\npublish our code and relevance judgments for reproducibility and\nto encourage future studies.2\n2\nRelated Work\nThis section outlines evaluation frameworks in retrieval, previous\nefforts to assess collection reliability, and judgement stability.\nOffline Evaluation. The Cranfield experiments introduced the\nmodern offline test collection in ad-hoc ranking; experts curated\na set of queries, and texts were retrieved from a static collection\nand exhaustively annotated, allowing for offline relevance judg-\nments [6]. Completeness of relevance judgments, i.e., the exhaustive\nannotation of corpora, is a key factor in the reliability of an offline\ntest collection [48]; however, the scale of modern corpora makes\nsuch a task infeasible. As such, TREC-style collections are collated\nby pooling the runs of multiple diverse systems to create a set of\nquery‚Äìdocument pairs to be annotated under the assumption that\nunpooled documents are not relevant [47]. Assessors then label\nthese pairs and assign a grade of relevance. A single annotator is\noften assigned to each topic; this decision generally reduces costs\nand has been validated by several studies measuring agreement\nbetween annotators as an effect on the reliability of a collection.\nRelevance judgments are subjective and, therefore, can vary\namong annotators [25], with low inter-annotator agreement [37],\nwhich can indicate low collection reliability. As such, narratives\nand training are usually provided to annotators describing the\ninformation need underlying a query [15]. We consider that these\nhomogenized judgments may be a weak point for ongoing collection\nreliability as we learn from them in a semi-supervised fashion\nthrough effective systems acting as teachers.\nNotions of Relevance. The reliability of offline test collections is\ncontested due to the intrinsic subjectivity of relevance under differ-\nent human annotators [34, 45], annotation settings [33], relevance\ngrading [10] and, more recently, the process of collecting candidate\ndocuments via pooling [54]. As these concerns have been raised, one\nmethod to validate offline test collections is to re-annotate judge-\nments. Lesk and Salton [23] and Burgin [4] empirically validated\nthe collection reliability under annotator disagreement, observing\nthat system order is maintained under different annotators by mea-\nsuring variance in precision and recall. When web-scale corpora\nrendered exhaustive annotation impossible, depth pooling became\npopularized to provide a minimal set of documents that should\nbe annotated to discriminate system effectiveness. Concerns were\ntwo-fold: that systems that contributed to the pool would have an\nadvantage over new systems and that the reduced annotations may\ndisrupt the stability of system orderings. Voorhees [46] found that\nsystem order stability could be maintained under the re-annotation\nof test collection pools from TREC-4 [14] and -6 [50].\nCollection Retirement. Previous work has discussed the retire-\nment of a test collection in recent years, though not retired before\ndissemination the use of TREC 2021 Deep Learning test collec-\ntion [9] is discouraged by NIST due to the large increase in corpora\nsize leading to pooling bias; both NIST [49] and participants in the\n2https://github.com/Parry-Parry/sigir25-annotation\n\n\nVariations in Relevance Judgments and the Shelf Life of Test Collections\nSIGIR ‚Äô25, July 13‚Äì18, 2024, Padua, Italy\ntrack [20] had concerns regarding the ability to measure recall due\nto incomplete labeling. However, we are not aware of any work\nthat considers the effect of collection popularity and subsequent\nbias induced by fitting to relevance judgments over time; our focus\non precision is in line with the philosophy of neural systems and\nthe Deep Learning track.\nCraswell et al. [9] warns against using TREC Deep Learning test\ncollections for experimental iteration to reduce the chance of overfit-\nting to judgments. Though this guidance is generally followed with\nthe MSMARCO-dev set acting as a suitable alternative, the broad\nuse of existing strong systems validated on TREC Deep Learning\n2019 [17, 32, 52] may lead to overfitting via semi-supervision. We\ndraw a parallel with the work of Armstrong et al. [3], which warned\nthat progress might stagnate due to poor practice in evaluation.\nSimilarly, we note that the continued comparison to a dataset that\nguides our architecture and training pipeline may lead to stagnation\nin system development.\nWithin a modern ranker training pipeline, several components\ndepend on existing models for effectiveness. Hard negative min-\ning is a process in which, instead of random negative examples\nin a contrastive loss, samples are taken from the top most rele-\nvant documents to a query with the assumption that the majority\nwill be non-relevant [21]. It is common to employ one or several\nmodels‚Äô pooled rankings to sample negatives [41, 53], with these\nmodels often chosen based on their in-domain effectiveness. More\nexplicitly, pipelines are frequently composed of multiple stages of\ndistillation [39, 51, 53], which is a semi-supervised process in which\na student model is optimized to approximate the output of a teacher\nmodel [16]. Again, these models will be chosen based on in-domain\neffectiveness and coupled with hard negatives.\n3\nEvaluating Reliability through Re-Annotation\nThe reliability of a test collection, given the subjectivity of relevance,\nis often validated by re-annotation [4, 23, 46]. Modern IR models\nare often optimized to mimic previously effective systems through\ndata-driven processes. We examine how these models, designed\nafter a collection‚Äôs release, perform on new judgments following\nthe process of Voorhees [46].\n3.1\nReproduction Source\nWe describe the original annotation process applied by Voorhees\n[46]. This work was carried out as a component of the curation of\nthe TREC-4 [14] and TREC-6 [50] corpora. As is standard in the cura-\ntion of pooled TREC corpora, one ‚Äúprimary\" annotator was assigned\nto each topic, subsequently judging each document in the pool. Two\nadditional annotators were assigned to each topic to validate the\neffect of re-annotation on depth-pooled corpora. A sub-sample of\njudgements was taken from the pool and re-annotated. In TREC-4,\na maximum of 200 relevant documents per topic were taken as a\nsecondary pool for re-annotation. Additionally, 200 non-relevant\ndocuments were sampled per topic. A binary judgement was as-\nsigned to each query‚Äìdocument pair, relevant or non-relevant. The\ntexts constituting the primary annotation pool, left unjudged in the\nsecondary pool, are included in all system evaluations, maintaining\nidentical pooling biases. The comparison of ‚Äúsecondary\" annota-\ntions was carried out to assess hypotheses that resurface frequently\nin IR literature. This work focuses on the subjectivity of relevance\nand how pooling affects this subjectivity. Thus, experiments were\nconducted over a depth-pooled corpus under construction at the\ntime. This process produces a subset of judgements where each\nquery‚Äìdocument pair was re-annotated twice.\nWhere possible, we follow the evaluation process of Voorhees\n[46], including analysis of the probability of two systems swapping\nin effectiveness under different annotators. We define an annota-\ntion ùëéas a tuple {ùëû,ùëë,ùëü} composed of query ùëû, document ùëë, and\njudgement ùëü‚àà[0, 1, 2, 3]. For a given annotator pair and a primary\nannotator, assigned ùëõquery-document pairs, we have three anno-\ntation sets ùê¥1,ùê¥2,ùê¥3 where ùê¥ùëñ= {ùëéùëó}ùëõ\nùëó=0. For ùëöqueries, as noted\nby Voorhees [46], there are 3ùëöpossible permutations. Thus, these\npermutations allow for the greater exploration of judgements that\ncould have been produced from a given annotation process. From\nthe 3 annotation sets, a permutation ùê¥‚àóis sampled ùë†times, and\nsystems are evaluated against each permutation. The probability\nof a swap between systems ùëñand ùëócan be evaluated under a given\nmeasure ùëìgiven judgements ùê¥‚àó. For systems ùëÜ, we produce a ma-\ntrix ùêµ‚ààZ|ùëÜ|√ó|ùëÜ| where ùêµ[ùëñ, ùëó] is the number of annotation samples\nwhich caused systems ùëÜùëñto have higher effectiveness than ùëÜùëó. The\nswap probability between these systems can then be computed as\nmin(ùêµ[ùëñ,ùëó],ùêµ[ùëó,ùëñ])\nùë†\n. Due to the symmetric treatment of system com-\nparisons, this computation is bounded between 0 and 0.5.\n3.2\nRe-Annotation of a Modern Collection\nWhile the original study focused on binary judgments, our work\nadapts this methodology to graded relevance and neural systems\nunder a modern evaluation setting. Our reproduction is conducted\non the TREC Deep Learning 2019 track (DL‚Äô19) [8]. Specifically,\nwe use the passage collection, which is generally more popular.\nThe proposal of more granular measures that explicitly consider\nthe ordering of a ranking, such as discounted cumulative gain, as\nopposed to set-based measures, such as Precision@ùëò, generally re-\nquires graded relevance as opposed to the binary relevance grades of\nolder collections. DL‚Äô19 was annotated under this setting with four\ngrades of relevance: ‚Äòperfectly relevant,‚Äô ‚Äòhighly relevant,‚Äô ‚Äòrelated‚Äô,\nand ‚Äònon-relevant.‚Äô This distinction leads to some key differences\nin our process and analysis.\nWe treat the original judgements of DL‚Äô19 as those of the ‚Äúpri-\nmary‚Äù annotator. In our study, two annotators from a pool of 8\nretrieval academics are assigned to each topic and act as ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù\nannotators aligning with the original study in that each topic is an-\nnotated by 2 new annotators; however, the original study does not\nspecify the number of total annotators. The size of the annotator\npool used in this work is similar to that of TREC collections [42],\nalbeit with a reduced total annotation budget due to cost and follow-\ning in the sampling setting of Voorhees [46]. We create a secondary\npool composed of all documents in the pool with a grade of 1\nor more and sample 100 documents per annotator from the non-\nrelevant documents of the primary pool. We reduce the number of\nnon-relevant judgments from the pool motivated by the hypoth-\nesis that agreement is far greater over what is non-relevant; for\nset-based measures, this choice leads to a balance between relevant\nand non-relevant texts and has minimal effect on nDCG.\nOur process for pool creation uses all judged documents at least\nrelated to a topic and assigns topics to annotators in a round-robin\n\n\nSIGIR ‚Äô25, July 13‚Äì18, 2024, Padua, Italy\nA. Parry et al.\nfashion to balance annotation load while maintaining two annota-\ntors per topic. A priority queue of annotator pairs ordered by their\ncurrent annotation load is produced and assigned the next topic\nwith the greatest number of judgements. The load on each annota-\ntor is then balanced by swapping large topics to annotators with\nminimal load in a second round-robin. We then assign non-relevant\ntexts to each annotator pair with a total mean annotation load of\n1125 pairs per annotator.\nAnnotator Instruction. Each annotator was provided with annota-\ntion guidelines, including the original relevance grade descriptions\nfrom DL‚Äô19. Annotators were made aware that instances had been\npreviously annotated for DL‚Äô19; however, they were not provided\nwith relevance grades or a grade distribution. Due to the specialist\nknowledge required to assess relevance in, for example, medical\ntopics, annotators were allowed to familiarise themselves with\ntopics at their discretion. To facilitate reproducibility and prevent\nexposure to discussion and instances of DL‚Äô19 relevance judgments,\nwhich may be indexed on common search engines, we instead en-\nforce the use of the ChatNoir search endpoint [30], which indexes\nClueWeb22 [28] and retrieves using BM25.\n3.3\nFurther Investigation\nBeyond our reproduction setting, we utilise re-annotated query-\ndocument pairs to investigate other aspects of collection reliability.\nJudgement Aggregation. Voorhees [46] apply several aggregation\noperations including permutation as described in Section 3.1 and\naggregate operators. We perform maximum, minimum, and mean\npooling over judgments. In the case of mean pooling, we do not\nperform further quantization; for example, three texts of grades 1,\n1.5, and 2 where the second text was annotated 1 and 2 by different\nannotators would be compared in that order.\nAbsent Narratives. The absence of narratives or larger descrip-\ntions for the TREC Deep Learning collections allows an additional\nfocus for our investigation: Annotators were prompted to note cases\nof ambiguity and, more generally, their difficulties in annotation.\nFurthermore, annotators were asked to create their narratives for\neach query so that agreement among annotators could be investi-\ngated with more granularity in the presence of a natural language\ndescription of their thought process during annotation. In doing so,\nwe measure query intent as a factor in agreement.\nTo ablate this factor, we fix narratives after the curation of judge-\nments to assess how narrative interpretation can affect agreement\nand downstream measures of effectiveness. We take three topics of\nlow, median, and high agreement measured via Fleiss ùúÖbetween the\nprimary and secondary annotators; half of the annotators reference\none narrative, and half reference the other. We can then further iso-\nlate sources of disagreement to query intent and intrinsic ambiguity\nof a query title both qualitatively and quantitatively.\nAnnotators as Oracles. User models underly many common IR\nmeasures such as discounted cumulative gain [19] and mean re-\nciprocal rank (@ùëò) [5]. In performing offline evaluations of search\nsystems using these measures, we aim to model effectiveness via\nuser behavior approximated by relevance judgments. In principle,\nan optimal system would approach a score of 1 for a normalized\nTable 2: Modern systems included in our analysis.

However, given the\nsubjective and variable nature of relevance under different query\nintents, such effectiveness, though possible, may not be indicative\nof a truly effective system. Human annotators outside the original\nannotation setting may represent strong search systems as they\nhave exhaustively annotated available documents to some cutoff ùëò.\nAs such, we measure the performance of each annotator under\noriginal relevance judgments as an indicator of how non-pooled\nmodern systems are performing relative to a more realistic ora-\ncle. Similarly to idealized discounted cumulative gain, we sort by\nrelevance grade post-aggregation. Though graded relevance lacks\ngranularity in contrast to scalar relevance scores, through in-grade\npermutations (shuffling), we validate that variations in downstream\nmeasures of effectiveness are minimal (SD < 0.0001).\n4\nEvaluation\nIn this section, we outline our investigation and analyze findings\nwhen evaluating using secondary annotations.\n4.1\nExperiment Design\nFollowing the re-annotation process of Voorhees [46], we observe\nthe impact of re-annotation on the DL‚Äô19 test collection, using\npermutations to assess modern system bias.\nDataset. The MSMARCO passage corpus is a collection of around\n8.8 million segmented documents covering a broad range of ad-hoc\nsearch topics [26]; this collection and accompanying training topics\nwere mined and annotated from Bing query logs. We re-annotate the\nTREC Deep Learning 2019 test collection [8], composed of 43 topics.\nUnlike the development split released originally with MSMARCO,\nthe DL‚Äô19 test set uses densely annotated depth-pooled topics taken\nfrom the associated TREC track that year.\nPool Description. The DL‚Äô19 track primarily focused on the com-\nparison of neural systems in ad-hoc ranking. For equivalence to\nthe re-ranking task, the top 100 texts of all submitted systems from\nboth re-ranking and retrieval tasks were included in our annotation\npool. The top 10 texts from each of the 75 systems (44% Neural LM,\n27% Neural, 29% lexical/traditional) were added to our pool, and\nwe use HiCal [1] to collect an additional 100 texts per topic.\n\n\nVariations in Relevance Judgments and the Shelf Life of Test Collections\nSIGIR ‚Äô25, July 13‚Äì18, 2024, Padua, Italy\nModels. We compare several neural architectures and training\nsettings. In addition to models that contributed to the original anno-\ntation pool, we include systems that use other models for either data\naugmentation or semi-supervised training via distillation. Table 2\nillustrates the degree of teacher distillation used in each architec-\nture; ColBERT and SPLADE act as end-to-end retrieval or first-stage\nretrievers, whereas all others re-rank BM25 [35] or ColBERT as\nnoted. For monoT5, monoELECTRA, and SetEncoder, we include\nmultiple model sizes, base and large for BERT/ELECTRA variants\nand base and 3B for T5. For monoELECTRA, we do not use the\noriginal checkpoints released by Pradeep et al. [31]; we instead use\ndistilled checkpoints released by Schlatt et al. [40] as we are inter-\nested in systems that use modern processes. When using RankGPT,\nwe employ GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o.\nMeasures. Voorhees [46] measure inter-annotator agreement in\na pair-wise setting using the overlap of judgements defined as\nthe number of common judgements divided by the total number\nof judgements. We additionally use Cohen‚Äôs ùúÖover both 4-grade\nand binarized relevance and Fleiss‚Äô ùúÖ, allowing for comparisons\nbetween 3 annotators (1 primary, 2 secondary) simultaneously. In\nthe TREC-4 and 6 test collections, macro-averaged precision was\nthe primary measure of effectiveness, and therefore, the previous\nstudy measured systems by MAP. The TREC DL tracks with four\ngrades of relevance instead primarily measure nDCG@10, and thus,\nour study is conducted over this metric. Aligned with Voorhees\n[46], we measure downstream system order correlation between\njudgement sets using measure Kendall‚Äôs ùúè; additionally, we measure\nSpearman‚Äôs ùúåand RBO.\nSystem Order Robustness. As we have multiple annotators per\nquery, we can observe pooled judgments across several hypothetical\nsets; we take all possible combinations of annotators and evaluate\nboth pooled and new models to observe the stability of system order\nunder new judgments. For a given judgment set, we produce a rank-\ning of systems by a target metric (i.e., nDCG@10) and compare this\nsystem order to the system ordering under the original judgments.\nWe aggregate rank Œî for all possible natural combinations over each\nsystem to observe how frequently a system degrades over other\nassessed systems. We measure significant differences in retrieval\neffectiveness via a paired t-test with Bonferroni correction for dif-\nferent annotator combinations. We measure significant changes\nin system rank by a Wilcoxon signed test comparing annotator\ncombinations with the system order by official TREC judgements.\n4.2\nPilot Study Findings\nWe conducted a pilot study over the top 10 pooled texts for 10 ran-\ndomly sampled topics. Table 3 summarizes the results. We observe\nthat the prevalence of grades 1 and 3 is inflated in these annotations\ncompared to the original annotations. In discussions with anno-\ntators, there was ambiguity about what separates a relevant text\nfrom a highly relevant text. Additionally, cultural context leads to\nambiguity in interpreting a query; for example, a query ‚Äúdog day af-\nternoon meaning‚Äù was difficult to interpret without broader context\nas a film exists with that name. The query could be interpreted as\nthe meaning of the phrase or the film. From these ambiguities, we\nallowed annotators to use a controlled search engine to familiarise\nthemselves with the topic. Annotators not from the USA generally\nnoted the difficulty in USA-centric topics.\nTable 3: Comparing the ration of annotation grades between\nthe primary annotators and secondary annotators in a pilot\nstudy of 10 topics.\nGrade Ratio\nAnnotators\n0\n1\n2\n3\n|ùê¥|\nPrimary\n0.487\n0.190\n0.308\n0.015\n1143\nSecondary\n0.560\n0.213\n0.108\n0.118\n600\nTable 4: Inter-Annotator agreement over combinations of\nannotators.

Voorhees [46] report overlap among\nannotators as a measure of agreement observing values around 0.4.\nIn Table 4, we present agreement measurements over both 4 grade\nand binarized relevance. We observe that under 4-grade relevance,\nall agreement values degrade relative to numbers stated in previous\nstudies. Fleiss‚Äô ùúÖmeasured over primary and secondary annota-\ntors indicates near-random agreement but generally improves by\naround 10 points in all cases over binary judgments. Overlap values\nover binary judgments generally correspond to those observed by\nVoorhees [46], and over solely secondary annotators, we observe\nhigh overlap values, suggesting that while disagreement stems from\nthe subjectivity of relevance and the annotation setting, the process\nof annotating over 4 grades is generally more variable regardless\nof topic granularity. In the third group, we find the lowest values\nin both 4 grade and binary relevance, which is again reflected in\nlow overlap and Cohen‚Äôs ùúÖvalues, potentially suggesting diverging\nquery intents or that this allocation of queries was particularly\nambiguous. However, we see increases in overlap values when mea-\nsured solely over secondary annotators, again suggesting that the\nannotation setting under which judgments are collected contributes\nto the improved agreement, as noted by Cuadra and Katter [10] and\nRegazzi [34] in previous annotation studies. Values of ùúÖare low in\nall cases, suggesting that generally quantifying relevance over 4\n\n\nSIGIR ‚Äô25, July 13‚Äì18, 2024, Padua, Italy\nA. Parry et al.\nFigure 1: Transitions in relevance grades from primary to\nsecondary annotations.\ngrades is more challenging for annotators than the re-annotation\nsetting of Voorhees [46]. The lack of pre-defined narratives clarify-\ning intent means annotators could interpret a query as they please,\npotentially resulting in three diverging topic interpretations.\nIn Figure 1, observe a Sankey flow diagram between the origi-\nnal relevance grade assigned by primary annotators and the new\ngrades by secondary annotators. Like previous work, a secondary\nannotation setting often leads to the reduction of relevance grades,\ne.g., 1 to 0 or 2 to 1. Validating our decision to sample a subset of\nnon-relevant judgements, 13% of 800 non-relevant texts change\ngrade, with 77% being a change to a grade of 1; we analyse outlier\ncases (providing a grade of 2 or more) in Section 4.4. Measuring\nfrequencies agnostic of previous judgments, grades 1 and 2 are\nannotated similarly across annotators, while grades 0 and 3 were\nannotated with greater variance. This variance in the case of grade\n0 is generally consistent across annotators, and we provide a deeper\nanalysis of grade 3 due to varying notions of relevance below.\n4.4\nNarratives, Intent, and Relevance\nThe observations of grade transitions in our work and generally low\nagreement noted by prior work, even in a binary setting, may be\nattributed to several factors noted in Section 2. Though we cannot\nfully isolate factors in the subjectivity of relevance, we choose to\ninvestigate the effect of narratives on inter-annotator agreement,\ngiven that recent corpora often do not have fixed narratives [7, 8],\nunlike those used in prior re-annotation studies [14]. We select\ntopics by median, minimum and max Fleiss‚Äô ùúÖvalues from the\nannotation pool and consider where disagreement occurs and how\nnarratives differ. Chosen examples illustrate different aspects of\nagreement, differing query intents, and a narrative‚Äôs specificity.\nThe first, taken from Group 1, is a technical query in the med-\nical domain with a Fleiss ùúÖof 0.06, indicating disagreement near\nrandom guessing. The query ‚Äútypes of dysarthria from cerebral\npalsy‚Äù was described by one annotator as a query from a sibling\nof someone with cerebral palsy looking to understand how their\nsibling would be affected by their condition in the future. The other\nannotator described a medical context in which the definition of all\nconditions is known, and therefore, solely the connection between\ndysarthria and cerebral palsy was required. The second annotator\nstated a requirement that relevance was determined by the types\nand specificity of provided types of dysarthria connected to cere-\nbral palsy, with all other documents being non-relevant. Though\nboth are valid information needs, they represent vastly different\nquery intents, with one annotator‚Äôs grade frequency matching the\noverall annotation pool and the other stricter narrative leading to\nnear-total non-relevance.\nThe second, taken from Group 4, is a more general query, ‚Äúis cdg\nairport in main paris‚Äù with a Fleiss ùúÖof 0.08, again indicating low\nagreement. However, both annotators described a need for exact\ndistances from the airport to either the center of Paris or, more\ngenerally, the city of Paris. Both annotators required a succinct\ndescription of the distance or travel times to the airport from Paris\nto be considered perfectly relevant. To be highly relevant, both con-\nsidered any mention of either travel time or distance measurements.\nIntents then diverged for partially relevant documents, with one an-\nnotator allowing for the mention of costs and other aspects of travel\nto and from the airport. In contrast, the other annotator required\nthe airport‚Äôs position, at minimum, mentioning that it is situated\nwith respect to Paris. Non-relevance was denoted by any other\nmention of the airport or mentions of distances to destinations near\nParis. We find larger differences in lower relevance grades, with\none annotator considering the majority of pooled documents to be\nnon-relevant when there is no mention of travel details. In contrast,\nthe other considers them to be relevant because they mention that\nthe airport is situated near Paris in a generic manner. The specificity\nof a query generally leads to lower agreement in our observations.\nWhile queries in domains such as law or medicine have a lower\noverall agreement, we still find cases where generic queries have\nlow agreement due to the interpretations of information needs.\nWe analyze outlier cases of texts initially labeled non-relevant\nthat, when evaluated under an alternative query intent, were\ndeemed perfectly relevant. In the 9 cases of this, there are cases\nwhere a reference is made to the entity of focus, for example ‚Äúgold-\nfish‚Äù in the query, ‚Äúdo goldfish grow‚Äù but only implicitly, for exam-\nple ‚Äúit‚Äù or ‚Äúthey‚Äù. The query was satisfied by a given document if\nthe context is inferred by the surrounding spans of text or from\nknowing that the document has been retrieved by some system\n(this is inevitable under pooling), but the information is not self-\ncontained. In some cases, annotators explicitly stated that they\nconsidered a document relevant, but when the information is not\nself-contained, it cannot be annotated as relevant; others took this\napproach without note.\nOverall, many annotation disagreements can occur not only in\nthe high-level query intent of the narrative but also in descriptions\nof relevance. A diagnostic tool and query-specific grade specifica-\ntions could be helpful in future work.\n4.5\nNarrative and Intent Ambiguity\nGiven the lack of public narratives provided in the release of TREC\nDeep Learning 2019, it is infeasible to isolate query intent as a factor\nin reliability without first collecting narratives. In fixing narratives,\nwe produce an additional set of relevance judgements for queries of\nlow, median, and high agreement by Fleiss ùúÖ, including the primary\nannotator. In Figure 2, We classify these queries as difficult, median\nand easy with respect to query intent determination and measure\n\n\nVariations in Relevance Judgments and the Shelf Life of Test Collections\nSIGIR ‚Äô25, July 13‚Äì18, 2024, Padua, Italy\nAnnotator 2 (1)\nAnnotator 3 (1)\nAnnotator 6 (1)\nAnnotator 8 (1)\nAnnotator 1 (2)\nAnnotator 4 (2)\nAnnotator 5 (2)\nAnnotator 7 (2)\nAnnotator 2 (1)\nAnnotator 3 (1)\nAnnotator 6 (1)\nAnnotator 8 (1)\nAnnotator 1 (2)\nAnnotator 4 (2)\nAnnotator 5 (2)\nAnnotator 7 (2)\n0.2\n0.3 0.0\n0.2 0.5 0.0\n0.1 0.0 0.1 0.1\n0.2 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.3\n0.0 0.1 -0.1 0.1 0.3 0.2\n0.2 0.3 0.1 0.4 0.1 0.1 0.1\nDifficult Query\nAnnotator 2 (1)\nAnnotator 3 (1)\nAnnotator 6 (1)\nAnnotator 8 (1)\nAnnotator 1 (2)\nAnnotator 4 (2)\nAnnotator 5 (2)\nAnnotator 7 (2)\nAnnotator 2 (1)\nAnnotator 3 (1)\nAnnotator 6 (1)\nAnnotator 8 (1)\nAnnotator 1 (2)\nAnnotator 4 (2)\nAnnotator 5 (2)\nAnnotator 7 (2)\n0.3\n0.3 0.2\n0.4 0.6 0.1\n0.4 0.5 0.3 0.4\n0.2 0.4 0.2 0.4 0.3\n0.4 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.5 0.3\n0.3 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.5 0.2 0.6\nMedian Query\nAnnotator 2 (1)\nAnnotator 3 (1)\nAnnotator 6 (1)\nAnnotator 8 (1)\nAnnotator 1 (2)\nAnnotator 4 (2)\nAnnotator 5 (2)\nAnnotator 7 (2)\nAnnotator 2 (1)\nAnnotator 3 (1)\nAnnotator 6 (1)\nAnnotator 8 (1)\nAnnotator 1 (2)\nAnnotator 4 (2)\nAnnotator 5 (2)\nAnnotator 7 (2)\n0.5\n0.3 0.1\n0.2 0.3 0.3\n0.1 0.2 0.5 0.3\n0.3 0.2 0.6 0.4 0.4\n0.3 0.4 0.5 0.4 0.6 0.7\n0.1 0.2 0.4 0.4 0.7 0.3 0.6\nEasy Query\n1.00\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\nCohen's \nFigure 2: Comparing 3 queries of varying difficulty by inter-annotator agreement under fixed narratives (2 narratives (1) and (2)).\nAnnotators were divided into two groups and were assigned identical document pools.

It\nis clear that a fixed narrative reduces ambiguity with Cohen‚Äôs ùúÖ,\nimproving by 24% and 46% for each annotation group between the\ndifficult and median query; however, between the median and easy\nquery, a decrease of 8% and an increase of 19% is observed.\nIn several cases, high agreement across different narrative groups\noccurs; in each case, narratives are of similar detail, defining what\nintent the user had in searching as well as what should be labelled\nrelevant; we consider that one factor in relevance annotation be-\nyond random noise may therefore be interpretation of a narrative\nwhich in the case of a primary annotator is of minimal concern but\nin human-in-the-loop annotation with generative systems may lead\nto implications for control as ultimately we can only express our\nneed or a demonstration to the system in natural language. When\ncomputing global improvements in agreement, we measure a 79%\nincrease in agreement between the difficult and median query and\nan additional 1% increase comparing the median and easy query.\nFrom these observations, we propose that the greatest factor in\ndisagreement is simply the ambiguity of the natural language used\nto express a query regardless of the narrative applied. Whether or\nnot this is only inherent in pooled corpora would require further\ninvestigation as in a setting such as that of TREC DL‚Äô19, the ad-hoc\nrealisation of a query intent will be biased by the top-ùëòtexts chosen\nby pooled systems.\n4.6\nCore Assessment of System Order\nThe core objective in re-annotation studies is to validate that down-\nstream evaluation is not compromised by human bias in subjective\nrelevance judgements. By measuring the stability of system order\nand the correlation of system order by target metrics, we can assess\ncollection reliability. Following Voorhees [46] and as described in\nSection 3.1, we sample permutations of relevance judgements and\nobserve the stability of pair-wise system comparisons in Figure 3.\nComparisons closest to the top right of the figure represent those\nwhere nDCG differences are large; however, they frequently swap\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n nDCG@10\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nProbability of Swap\nNeural\nLLM-Neural\nLLM\nFigure 3: Comparing the stability of judgements through\nnDCG@10 and system swap probabilities over 10000 judge-\nment permutations.

A clear pareto-frontier is composed of compar-\nisons between LLM and neural systems under judgement permuta-\ntions. Lexical-neural comparisons generally lie in the main body\nof neural-neural and llm-llm comparisons, suggesting similar sta-\nbility as was noted by Voorhees [46] over TREC-6. However, more\ngenerally, we replicate the findings of previous works that despite\nlow annotator agreement, under re-annotation, system ordering is\nhighly correlated with the original DL‚Äô19 annotations even under\n4-grade relevance. In Table 5, observe aggregate correlation values\nusing both natural combinations of annotators and the in-sample\napproach described by Voorhees [46].\nAs the In-Sample approach includes primary judgements, a\nmarginally higher correlation compared to combinations of solely\n\n\nSIGIR ‚Äô25, July 13‚Äì18, 2024, Padua, Italy\nA.

To investigate where system order\ndiverges, we analyse ranking changes at a system level. In Figure 4\nsee that generally, new annotations led to a reduction in absolute\nnDCG@10 values relative to the original annotations, effectiveness\nmeasures on original annotations order systems, and that system\norder is not fully stable but LLM-based or distilled systems ap-\npear to be outliers, as such we explicitly measure the changes in\nsystem order concentrated around these systems. In Figure 5, we\ncombine all possible permutations of annotators across annotation\npairs. We measure changes in system order under these combina-\ntions and aggregate by system. Many lexical systems remain stable\nin ordering (Œî ‚âà0). Older neural approaches in the original sys-\ntem pool display higher variance but can improve or degrade in\nrank without significant difference. When considering only modern\nsystems, we observe that smaller models trained with supervised\nand semi-supervised approaches consistently improve system rank.\nWithin this group, however, larger semi-supervised models are\nmore robust than their smaller counterparts under new judgments.\nList-wise encoders generally degrade in rank.

Changes in effectiveness are\nmore pronounced and are significant in smaller distilled language\nmodels. This is notable as though we see continuing improvement\nin smaller models out-of-domain through distillation. One should\nbe cautious that in-domain effectiveness may be less robust than\nbenchmarks indicate, which for many applications may be more\nimportant than robust effectiveness across heterogeneous corpora.\nRuns that are either zero-shot or distilled from LLM re-rankers\nshow the highest variance in relative effectiveness even within a\nsub-group such as those based on GPT 4 endpoints. GPT-4o-based\nruns significantly degrade in system rank when re-ranking BM25\nbut are more stable under a neural first-stage ColBERT. This is most\nlikely caused by positional bias found in list-wise ranking towards\nalready precise first-stage rankings [29, 44]. This hypothesis is\nvalidated by the frequent rank improvement of RankZephyr (the\nleft-most model in Figure 4), which was trained explicitly to reduce\nthis bias [32]. Overall, we consider that though high-quality data\n(i.e., granular training data from strong models) is important in\nimproving the robustness of neural models, these findings would\nsuggest that smaller models in our current training strategies may\nnot have the capacity to robustly generalize even in-domain.\n4.7\nSystems versus Humans\nRecall our argument that a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù score on a normalized metric\nmay not be a feasible or desirable goal in ranking evaluation; as\nsuch, we measure the effectiveness of human annotators aggre-\ngated in multiple forms outlined in Section 3.3.

Negative Œî indicates a system frequently improves in rank.\nthe retrieval effectiveness [13, 36]), annotator performance mea-\nsured by precision can be exceeded by neural systems across nDCG,\nP, and MRR; however, recall remains lower in all settings. Given\nour findings in Figure 4, an observation that systems are better\nthan humans should be considered cautiously. However, the robust-\nness of the LLM-based RankZephyr observed both by system order\nrobustness over new judgments and its parity with human anno-\ntators suggests that with sufficient capacity, a smaller system can\nbe distilled from larger systems while remaining robust. Observing\nsimilar effectiveness to humans and confidence intervals providing\nno way to discriminate systems, we consider that achieving signifi-\ncant improvements would suggest far exceeding humans, which\nmay not be possible in a way conducive to improving information\naccess and may solely serve to improve precision on specific topics\nand intents. The ability of distilled systems to reach parity with\nhuman effectiveness across multiple annotator combinations while\nobtaining largely reduced recall in a judged setting, even when\nre-ranking a neural first-stage retriever, is undesirable for several\ndownstream tasks. Although precision is approaching or overtaking\nthe effectiveness of an oracle, recall remains a challenge in densely\nannotated collections.\n5\nConclusion\nWe considered important studies on the impact of the annotator\nagreement on retrieval evaluations in light of modern neural evalu-\nation scenarios. In reproducing re-annotation processes and evalu-\nations by Voorhees [46] on a modern test collection, we validate\nthe stability system ordering under re-annotation under 4-grade\nrelevance and ambiguous query intent. We raised concerns that\nthe broad and frequent use of test collections to ‚Äútune‚Äù learned\nsystems implicitly through influences from published works may\nreduce the reliability of a collection over time. We identified that\nthe subjectivity of relevance through query intent may be a factor\nin determining ‚Äúoverfitting‚Äù in ranking tasks. As a query may have\nseveral interpretations, we re-annotate the popular TREC DL‚Äô19\ncollection. We found that system order varies when evaluating large\nlanguage models and systems distilled from them. Furthermore,\nwe observed that the current state-of-the-art can outperform com-\nbinations of human annotators on original relevance judgments,\nsuggesting we may have reached a realistic bound on precision for\nthis collection. We posit that further improvement on this collection\nmay not indicate that a system is better than another in a meaning-\nful way. Our process has limitations‚Äîmost notably, re-annotation is\nincredibly costly. Future work will investigate how to draw similar\nconclusions about a collection‚Äôs expiration without the need for\nextensive human effort.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Sean MacAvaney and others involved in making the\nsessions of the Collab-a-thon at ECIR‚Äò24 [24] an engaging space for\ncollaboration.\nReferences\n[1] Mustafa Abualsaud, Nimesh Ghelani, Haotian Zhang, Mark D Smucker,\nGordon V Cormack, and Maura R Grossman. 2018.

    "abstract": "The fundamental property of Cranfield-style evaluations, that system rankings\nare stable even when assessors disagree on individual relevance decisions, was\nvalidated on traditional test collections. However, the paradigm shift towards\nneural retrieval models affected the characteristics of modern test\ncollections, e.g., documents are short, judged with four grades of relevance,\nand information needs have no descriptions or narratives. Under these changes,\nit is unclear whether assessor disagreement remains negligible for system\ncomparisons. We investigate this aspect under the additional condition that the\nfew modern test collections are heavily re-used. Given more possible query\ninterpretations due to less formalized information needs, an ''expiration\ndate'' for test collections might be needed if top-effectiveness requires\noverfitting to a single interpretation of relevance. We run a reproducibility\nstudy and re-annotate the relevance judgments of the 2019 TREC Deep Learning\ntrack. We can reproduce prior work in the neural retrieval setting, showing\nthat assessor disagreement does not affect system rankings. However, we observe\nthat some models substantially degrade with our new relevance judgments, and\nsome have already reached the effectiveness of humans as rankers, providing\nevidence that test collections can expire.",
