However, their\nrelationship remains unexplored. This study theoretically examines the solutions of these two meth-\nods, and reveals that they are not generally equivalent, despite coinciding at the collocation points.\nStrictly speaking, Stenger’s method assumes that the kernel of the integral is a function of a single\nvariable, but this study theoretically justiﬁes the use of his method in general cases, i.e., the kernel is a\nfunction of two variables. Then, this study rigorously proves that both methods can attain the same,\nroot-exponential convergence. In addition to the contribution, this study improves Stenger’s method\nto attain signiﬁcantly higher, almost exponential convergence. Numerical examples supporting the\ntheoretical results are also provided.\nKey words.

This paper is concerned with numerical solu-\ntions via Sinc numerical methods [14, 15] for Volterra integral equations of the second\nkind of the form\n(1.1)\nu(t) −\nZ t\na\nk(t, s)u(s) ds = g(t),\na ≤t ≤b.\nHere, k(t, s) and g(t) are given continuous functions, and u(t) is the solution to be\ndetermined.\nThe equations are often expressed symbolically as (I −V)u = g by\nintroducing Volterra integral operator V : C([a, b]) →C([a, b]) as\nV[f](t) =\nZ t\na\nk(t, s)f(s) ds.\nOne of powerful tools in the Sinc numerical methods, especially for the target equa-\ntions (1.1), is the Sinc indeﬁnite integration [2, 4]. This provides an approximation\nformula for indeﬁnite integral in the following form\nZ t\na\nF(s) ds ≈\nN\nX\nj=−N\nF(sj)ωj(t),\nwhere the weight ωj is a function depending on t, whereas the sampling point sj is\nﬁxed, independent of t, even though the interval of the integral (a, t) depends on t.\nThis is quite a unique feature, because not only ωj but also sj should depend on t if\na standard quadrature rule is used for approximating the indeﬁnite integral. As an-\nother beautiful feature, the Sinc indeﬁnite integration can attain exponential order of\nconvergence, which signiﬁcantly exceeds polynomial order of convergence.

OKAYAMA\nthese features, Muhammad et al. [5] considered the Sinc indeﬁnite integration of V,\nsay VN, and numerical solution uN that satisﬁes the following equation\n(I −VN)uN = g.\nThe procedure to obtain the solution uN is called the Sinc-Nystr¨om method, which is\ndescribed in section 3. Theoretical analysis has established that the method achieves\na convergence rate of O(exp(−\n√\nπdN)) [10], where d indicates the size of the domain\nin which the solution u is analytic.\nAnother numerical solution for (1.1) via Sinc numerical methods was developed by\nRashidinia and Zarebnia [12]. They derived their method following quite a standard\ncollocation procedure based on the Sinc approximation (a function approximation\nformula), which also attains an exponential order of convergence. Let PNf denote\nthe Sinc approximation of f. Then, as shown in this paper, the equation to be solved\nis written symbolically as\n(I −PNVN)wN = PNg.\nThe procedure to obtain the solution wN is called the Sinc-collocation method, which\nis described in section 4. Although a theoretical error analysis of the method was\ngiven [17], its convergence was not strictly proved.\nYet another numerical solution for (1.1) via Sinc numerical methods was developed\nby Stenger [13]. Although his method was introduced more than a decade before the\nabove methods, it has received considerably less attention. This may be because the\ntarget equation of his method is not exactly (1.1). The interest of his method is in\ninitial value problems\nu′(t) = ˜k(t)u(t) + ˜g(t),\nu(a) = ua,\nwhich can be reduced to a form of Volterra integral equations of the second kind as\n(1.2)\nu(t) −\nZ t\na\n˜k(s)u(s) ds = g(t),\nwhere g(t) = ua +\nR t\na ˜g(s) ds. Because the kernel here (˜k) is a function of a single\nvariable, Stenger’s method does not appear to cover the general case as (1.1). However,\naside from theoretical justiﬁcation, it is relatively evident that his method remains\nimplementable even when the kernel is a function of two variables.\nIts numerical\nsolution, say vN, is determined in the following two steps: (i) obtain the Sinc-Nystr¨om\nsolution uN, and (ii) apply the Sinc approximation to uN. The step (i) implies that\nStenger’s method is based on the Sinc-Nystr¨om method, but vN is not equal to uN\nbecause of the step (ii). The detailed procedure is described in section 4 (strictly\nspeaking, it is the ﬁrst time that the explicit procedure for the general case (1.1) is\npresented). Its convergence has been stated [13] assuming that the kernel is a function\nof a single variable.\nAs seen above, three numerical methods have been proposed based on the Sinc\nnumerical methods: Sinc-Nystr¨om method, Sinc-collocation method, and Stenger’s\nmethod. Therefore, a question may naturally arise: what is the diﬀerence (or similar-\nity), and which method is the best? The ﬁrst objective of this study is to investigate\nthis question from both theoretical and practical perspectives. This study ﬁrst reveals\nthat Stenger’s method can be regarded as another Sinc-collocation method. Then, it\n\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO SINC-COLLOCATION METHODS\n3\nis shown that Stenger’s method and Rashidinia–Zarebnia’s method coincide at the col-\nlocation points, but they are not generally equivalent. Furthermore, this study shows\nthat the convergence rate of the two Sinc-collocation methods is exactly the same:\nO(\n√\nN exp(−\n√\nπdαN)), where α is the order of H¨older continuous with 0 < α ≤1.\nFrom an implementation perspective, Stenger’s method is preferable, because it is\nsimpler and easier to implement than the method by Rashidinia and Zarebnia.\nThus, we only have to compare two methods: Sinc-Nystr¨om method and Stenger’s\nSinc-collocation method. Even when α = 1, the convergence rate of Stenger’s method\nis slightly lower than that of the Sinc-Nystr¨om method. However, numerical exper-\niments indicate that the Sinc-Nystr¨om method requires much computation time to\nobtain the same accuracy as Stenger’s method. This is primarily because the basis\nfunctions of the Sinc-Nystr¨om method include the sine integral (a special function),\nwhich requires a high computational cost. Based on this ﬁnding, we conclude that\nStenger’s method is preferable among the three methods described above.\nThe second objective of this study is to improve Stenger’s method. In the afore-\nmentioned three methods, the tanh transformation\n(1.3)\nt = ψ\nSE(x) = b −a\n2\ntanh\n\u0010x\n2\n\u0011\n+ b + a\n2\nis employed in common to map R onto the target interval (a, b). This is because Sinc\nnumerical methods are originally deﬁned over the entire real axis R. Therefore, for\nthe ﬁnite interval, a variable transformation such as (1.3) is required. This study aims\nto improve Stenger’s method by replacing the tanh transformation with\n(1.4)\nt = ψ\nDE(x) = b −a\n2\ntanh\n\u0010π\n2 sinh x\n\u0011\n+ b + a\n2\n,\nwhich is called the double-exponential (DE) transformation. The convergence rates of\nvarious methods via Sinc numerical methods have been improved by replacing the tanh\ntransformation with the DE transformation [3, 15]. Speciﬁcally, the convergence rate\nof the Sinc-Nystr¨om method was enhanced to O(log(2dN) exp(−πdN/ log(2dN))/N)\nthrough the replacement [10]. On the basis of the observation, this study develops\na new Sinc-collocation method combined with the DE transformation. Furthermore,\nthis study performs theoretical analysis of the proposed method and shows that its\nconvergence rate is O(exp(−πdN/ log(2dN/α))), which signiﬁcantly exceeds that of\nStenger’s method. Although the rate is slightly lower than that of the Sinc-Nystr¨om\nmethod combined with the DE transformation, numerical experiments indicate that\nthe Sinc-Nystr¨om method requires much computation time to obtain the same accu-\nracy as the proposed method. This is similarly observed when comparing the Sinc-\nNystr¨om and Sinc-collocation methods combined with the tanh transformation.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, as a preliminary,\nconvergence theorems of the Sinc approximation and the Sinc indeﬁnite integration\nare described. In section 3, the Sinc-Nystr¨om methods developed by Muhammad et\nal. [5] are described, and their convergence theorems are stated. In section 4, the\nSinc-collocation methods developed by Stenger [13] and Rashidinia–Zarebnia [12] are\ndescribed. Subsequently, new theoretical results from this study are stated: (i) the two\nnumerical solutions coincide at the collocation points but are not generally equivalent,\nand (ii) the two methods attain the same convergence rate O(\n√\nN exp(−\n√\nπdαN)).\nIn section 5, a new Sinc-collocation method combined with the DE transformation\nis developed. Subsequently, its convergence theorem is stated claiming that the con-\nvergence rate is O(exp(−πdN/ log(2dN/α))).\nIn section 6, numerical experiments\n\n\n4\nT. OKAYAMA\nare presented, where the DE-Sinc-collocation method demonstrates the best perfor-\nmance. In section 7, proofs for the new theorems presented in section 4 are provided.\nIn section 8, proofs for the new theorems presented in section 5 are provided.\n2. Preliminaries. This section summarizesthe Sinc approximation and Sinc in-\ndeﬁnite integration and their application with the aid of the tanh or DE transforma-\ntion.\n2.1. Sinc approximation and Sinc indeﬁnite integration. The Sinc nu-\nmerical methods are generic names of numerical methods based on the Sinc approxi-\nmation, expressed as\n(2.1)\nF(x) ≈\nN\nX\nj=−N\nF(jh)S(j, h)(x),\nx ∈R,\nwhere h is a mesh size appropriately chosen depending on N, and the basis function\nS(j, h) is the so-called Sinc function deﬁned by\nS(j, h)(x) =\n\n\n\nsin(π(x −jh)/h)\nπ(x −jh)/h\n(x ̸= jh),\n1\n(x = jh).\nIntegrating both sides of (2.1), we obtain an approximation formula called the Sinc\nindeﬁnite integration as\nZ ξ\n−∞\nF(x) dx ≈\nN\nX\nj=−N\nF(jh)\nZ ξ\n−∞\nS(j, h)(x) dx =\nN\nX\nj=−N\nF(jh)J(j, h)(ξ),\nξ ∈R,\n(2.2)\nwhere J(j, h) is deﬁned by\nJ(j, h)(x) = h\n\u001a1\n2 + 1\nπ Si\n\u0014π(x −jh)\nh\n\u0015\u001b\n,\nwhere Si(x) is the sine integral deﬁned by Si(x) =\nR x\n0 {(sin t)/t} dt.\n2.2. SE-Sinc approximation and SE-Sinc indeﬁnite integration. To use\nthe approximation formulas (2.1) and (2.2), the function F(x) must be deﬁned over\nthe entire real line R. When the function f(t) is deﬁned over the ﬁnite interval (a, b),\na variable transformation is required to map R onto (a, b). For the purpose, the tanh\ntransformation t = ψSE(x) deﬁned in (1.3) is widely employed. The change of variable\n(t = ψSE(x)) enables us to apply (2.1) by setting F(x) = f(ψSE(x)). Introducing\ntSE\nj\n= ψSE(jh) and φSE(t) = {ψSE}−1(t), we express the obtained formula as\nf(t) ≈\nN\nX\nj=−N\nf(t\nSE\nj )S(j, h)(φ\nSE(t)),\nt ∈(a, b).\n(2.3)\nThis approximation is referred to as the SE-Sinc approximation in this paper. Simi-\nlarly, applying s = ψSE(x) and setting F(x) = f(ψSE(x)) in (2.2), we obtain\nZ t\na\nf(s) ds =\nZ φSE(t)\n−∞\nf(ψ\nSE(x)){ψ\nSE}′(x) dx\n(2.4)\n≈\nN\nX\nj=−N\nf(t\nSE\nj ){ψ\nSE}′(jh)J(j, h)(φ\nSE(t)),\nt ∈(a, b),\n\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO SINC-COLLOCATION METHODS\n5\nwhich is referred to as the SE-Sinc indeﬁnite integration in this paper. If F(x) =\nf(ψ(x)) is analytic on the strip complex domain\nDd = {ζ ∈C : | Im ζ| < d}\nfor a positive constant d, then both approximations performs highly accurately. In\nother words, f(t) should be analytic on the transformed domain\nψ\nSE(Dd) = {z = ψ\nSE(ζ) : ζ ∈Dd} ,\nwhich is a simply-connected domain. Convergence theorems of the two approxima-\ntions were provided as follows.\nTheorem 2.1 (Stenger [13, Theorem 4.2.5]).\nAssume that f is analytic on\nψSE(Dd) for d with 0 < d < π, and there exists constants K and α such that\n(2.5)\n|f(z)| ≤K|z −a|α|b −z|α\nholds for all z ∈ψSE(Dd). Let N be a positive integer, and let h be selected by the\nformula\n(2.6)\nh =\nr\nπd\nαN .\nThen, there exists a constant C independent of N such that\nmax\nt∈[a,b]\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\nf(t) −\nN\nX\nj=−N\nf(t\nSE\nj )S(j, h)(φ\nSE(t))\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\n≤C\n√\nN e−\n√\nπdαN .\nTheorem 2.2 (Okayama et al. [9, Theorem 2.9]). Assume that f is analytic on\nψSE(Dd) for d with 0 < d < π, and there exists constants K and α such that\n(2.7)\n|f(z)| ≤K|z −a|α−1|b −z|α−1\nholds for all z ∈ψSE(Dd). Let N be a positive integer, and let h be selected by the\nformula (2.6). Then, there exists a constant C independent of N such that\nmax\nt∈[a,b]\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\nZ t\na\nf(s) ds −\nN\nX\nj=−N\nf(t\nSE\nj ){ψ\nSE}′(jh)J(j, h)(φ\nSE(t))\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\n≤C e−\n√\nπdαN .\n2.3. DE-Sinc approximation and DE-Sinc indeﬁnite integration. The\nSE-Sinc approximation (2.3) and SE-Sinc indeﬁnite integration (2.4) employ the tanh\ntransformation (1.3) to map R onto the ﬁnite interval (a, b). The DE transforma-\ntion (1.4) also plays the same role, and allows for the replacement of ψSE with\nψDE in both formulas.\nOn the basis of this idea, introducing tDE\nj\n= ψDE(jh) and\nφDE(t) = {ψDE}−1(t), we can derive the following formulas\nf(t) ≈\nN\nX\nj=−N\nf(t\nDE\nj )S(j, h)(φ\nDE(t)),\nt ∈(a, b),\n(2.8)\nZ t\na\nf(s) ds ≈\nN\nX\nj=−N\nf(t\nDE\nj ){ψ\nDE}′(jh)J(j, h)(φ\nDE(t)),\nt ∈(a, b),\n(2.9)\n\n\n6\nT. OKAYAMA\nwhich are referred to as the DE-Sinc approximation and DE-Sinc indeﬁnite integra-\ntion, respectively. For the formulas (2.8) and (2.9), f(t) should be analytic on the\ntransformed domain\nψ\nDE(Dd) = {z = ψ\nDE(ζ) : ζ ∈Dd} ,\nwhich forms a Riemann surface. Convergence theorems of the two approximations\nwere provided as follows.\nTheorem 2.3 (Tanaka et al. [16, Theorem 3.1]). Assume that f is analytic on\nψDE(Dd) for d with 0 < d < π/2, and there exists constants K and α such that (2.5)\nholds for all z ∈ψDE(Dd). Let N be a positive integer, and let h be selected by the\nformula\n(2.10)\nh = log(2dN/α)\nN\n.\nThen, there exists a constant C independent of N such that\nmax\nt∈[a,b]\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\nf(t) −\nN\nX\nj=−N\nf(t\nDE\nj )S(j, h)(φ\nDE(t))\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\n≤C e−πdN/ log(2dN/α) .\nTheorem 2.4 (Okayama et al. [9, Theorem 2.16]). Assume that f is analytic on\nψDE(Dd) for d with 0 < d < π/2, and there exists constants K and α such that (2.7)\nholds for all z ∈ψDE(Dd). Let N be a positive integer, and let h be selected by the\nformula (2.10). Then, there exists a constant C independent of N such that\nmax\nt∈[a,b]\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\nZ t\na\nf(s) ds −\nN\nX\nj=−N\nf(t\nDE\nj ){ψ\nDE}′(jh)J(j, h)(φ\nDE(t))\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\n≤C log(2dN/α)\nN\ne−πdN/ log(2dN/α) .\n2.4. Generalized SE/DE-Sinc approximation. In the convergence theorems\nof the SE/DE-Sinc approximation, the condition (2.5) is assumed. This condition\nrequires f(t) to be zero at the endpoints t = a and t = b, which seems an impractical\ncondition. To address this issue, using auxiliary functions\nωa(t) = b −t\nb −a,\nωb(t) = t −a\nb −a,\nand setting ˜f SE\nN (t) = f(t) −f(tSE\n−N)ωa(t) −f(tSE\nN )ωb(t), Stenger [13, 14] proposed to\napply the SE-Sinc approximation to ˜f SE\nN .\nIf we deﬁne an approximation operator\nP SE\nN : C([a, b]) →C([a, b]) as\n(P\nSE\nN f)(t) = f(t\nSE\n−N)ωa(t) + f(t\nSE\nN )ωb(t) +\nN\nX\nj=−N\n˜f\nSE\nN (t\nSE\nj )S(j, h)(φ\nSE(t)),\n(2.11)\nthen the approximation is expressed as f ≈P SE\nN f. This approximation is referred to\nas the generalized SE-Sinc approximation in this paper. Notably, P SE\nN satisﬁes the\ninterpolation property, that is, f(tSE\ni ) = (P SE\nN f)(tSE\ni ) (i = −N, . . . , N).\n\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO SINC-COLLOCATION METHODS\n7\nSimilarly, setting ˜f DE\nN (t) = f(t)−f(tDE\n−N)ωa(t)−f(tDE\nN )ωb(t), we may apply the DE-\nSinc approximation to ˜f DE\nN . If we deﬁne an approximation operator P DE\nN : C([a, b]) →\nC([a, b]) as\n(P\nDE\nN f)(t) = f(t\nDE\n−N)ωa(t) + f(t\nDE\nN )ωb(t) +\nN\nX\nj=−N\n˜f\nSE\nN (t\nDE\nj )S(j, h)(φ\nDE(t)),\n(2.12)\nthen the approximation is expressed as f ≈P DE\nN f. This approximation is referred\nto as the generalized DE-Sinc approximation in this paper. P DE\nN\nalso satisﬁes the\ninterpolation property, that is, f(tDE\ni ) = (P DE\nN f)(tDE\ni ) (i = −N, . . . , N).\nThe convergence theorems of the two approximations are described using the\nfollowing function spaces.\nDefinition 2.5. Let D be a bounded and simply-connected domain (or Riemann\nsurface). Then, H∞(D) denotes the family of functions f analytic on D such that\nthe norm ∥f∥H∞(D) is ﬁnite, where\n∥f∥H∞(D) = sup\nz∈D\n|f(z)|.\nDefinition 2.6. Let α be a positive constant, and let D be a bounded and simply-\nconnected domain (or Riemann surface) that satisﬁes (a, b) ⊂D.\nThen, Mα(D)\ndenotes the family of functions f ∈H∞(D) for which there exists a constant L such\nthat for all z ∈D,\n|f(z) −f(a)| ≤L|z −a|α,\n|f(b) −f(z)| ≤L|b −z|α.\nThis function space Mα(D) only requires the H¨older continuity at the endpoints\ninstead of the zero-boundary condition by (2.5). Convergence theorems of the two\napproximations were provided as follows. Here, ∥· ∥C([a,b]) denotes the usual uniform\nnorm over [a, b].\nTheorem 2.7 (Okayama [6, Theorem 3]). Assume that f ∈Mα(ψSE(Dd)) for d\nwith 0 < d < π. Let N be a positive integer, and let h be selected by the formula (2.6).\nThen, there exists a constant C independent of N such that\n∥f −P\nSE\nN f∥C([a,b]) ≤C\n√\nN e−\n√\nπdαN .\nTheorem 2.8 (Okayama [6, Theorem 6]).\nAssume that f ∈Mα(ψDE(Dd)) for\nd with 0 < d < π /2.\nLet N be a positive integer, and let h be selected by the\nformula (2.10). Then, there exists a constant C independent of N such that\n∥f −P\nDE\nN f∥C([a,b]) ≤C e−πdN/ log(2dN/α) .\n3. Sinc-Nystr¨om methods. This section describes the Sinc-Nystr¨om methods\ndeveloped by Muhammad et al. [5]. The ﬁrst method employs the tanh transfor-\nmation (1.3) as a variable transformation, while the second method employs the DE\ntransformation (1.4).\n3.1. SE-Sinc-Nystr¨om method. By applying the SE-Sinc indeﬁnite integra-\ntion (2.4) to the integral in the given equation (1.1), we obtain an approximated\nequation as\n(3.1)\nu\nSE\nN (t) = g(t) +\nN\nX\nj=−N\nk(t, t\nSE\nj )u\nSE\nN (t\nSE\nj ){ψ\nSE}′(jh)J(j, h)(φ\nSE(t)).\n\n\n8\nT.

This system is expressed in a matrix-vector\nform as follows. Let n = 2N + 1, let In be an identity matrix of order n, and let V SE\nn\nbe n × n matrix whose (i, j)-th element is\n(V\nSE\nn )ij = k(t\nSE\ni , t\nSE\nj ){ψ\nSE}′(jh)hδ(−1)\ni−j ,\ni = −N, . . . , N,\nj = −N, . . . , N,\nwhere δ(−1)\nk\n= (1/2) + σk, where σk is deﬁned by\nσk =\nZ k\n0\nsin(πx)\nπx\ndx = 1\nπ Si(πk).\nFurthermore, let gSE\nn and uSE\nn be n-dimensional vectors deﬁned by\ng\nSE\nn = [g(t\nSE\n−N), g(t\nSE\n−N+1), . . . , g(t\nSE\nN )]T,\nu\nSE\nn = [u\nSE\nN (t\nSE\n−N), u\nSE\nN (t\nSE\n−N+1), . . . , u\nSE\nN (t\nSE\nN )]T.\nThen, the system (3.2) is expressed as\n(3.3)\n(In −V\nSE\nn )u\nSE\nn = g\nSE\nn .\nBy solving (3.3), we obtain the unknown coeﬃcients uSE\nn , from which the approx-\nimated solution uSE\nN is determined by (3.1). This procedure is called the SE-Sinc-\nNystr¨om method. Its convergence theorem was provided as follows.\nTheorem 3.1 (Okayama et al. [10, Theorem 3.4]).\nLet d be a positive constant\nwith d < π. Assume that g, k(z, ·) and k(·, w) belong to H∞(ψSE(Dd)) for all z,\nw ∈ψSE(Dd). Furthermore, assume that g, k(t, ·) and k(·, s) belong to C([a, b]) for\nall t, s ∈[a, b]. Let h be selected by the formula (2.6) with α = 1. Then, there exists\na positive integer N0 such that for all N ≥N0, the coeﬃcient matrix (In −V SE\nn ) is\ninvertible. Furthermore, there exists a constant C independent of N such that for all\nN ≥N0,\n∥u −u\nSE\nN ∥C([a,b]) ≤C e−\n√\nπdN .\n3.2. DE-Sinc-Nystr¨om method. Muhammad et al.

This section describes two diﬀerent\nSinc-collocation methods developed by Stenger [13] and Rashidinia and Zarebnia [12].\nBoth methods employ the tanh transformation (1.3) as a variable transformation, but\ntheir procedures are not identical.\n4.1. Sinc-collocation method by Stenger. As explained in section 1, Stenger\nderived his method for (1.2), where the kernel ˜k is a function of a single variable.\nHowever, his method can be easily derived for (1.1) as follows. His method is closely\nrelated to the SE-Sinc-Nystr¨om method, which is described in the previous section.\nFirst, solve the linear system (3.3) and obtain uSE\nn . Then, his approximated solution\nvSE\nN is expressed as the generalized SE-Sinc approximation of uSE\nN , i.e.,\nv\nSE\nN (t) = P\nSE\nN [u\nSE\nN ](t)\n(4.1)\n=\nN\nX\nj=−N\n\b\nu\nSE\nN (t\nSE\nj ) −u\nSE\nN (t\nSE\n−N)ωa(t\nSE\nj ) −u\nSE\nN (t\nSE\nN )ωb(t\nSE\nj )\n\t\nS(j, h)(φ\nSE(t))\n+ u\nSE\nN (t\nSE\n−N)ωa(t) + u\nSE\nN (t\nSE\nN )ωb(t),\nwhere P SE\nN is deﬁned by (2.11).\nThe solution vSE\nN is also obtained by the standard collocation procedure as fol-\nlows. Set the approximate solution vSE\nN as (4.1), where uSE\nN (tSE\nj ) (j = −N, . . . , N) are\nregarded as unknown coeﬃcients. Substitute vSE\nN into the given equation (1.1), with\napproximating the Volterra integral operator V by V SE\nN , where\n(4.2)\nV\nSE\nN [f](t) =\nN\nX\nj=−N\nk(t, t\nSE\nj )f(t\nSE\nj ){ψ\nSE}′(jh)J(j, h)(φ\nSE(t)),\nwhich is the SE-Sinc indeﬁnite integration of Vf. Then, setting n = 2N + 1 sampling\npoints at t = tSE\ni\n(i = −N, −N + 1, . . . , N), we obtain the same system of linear\nequations as (3.3). Thus, Stenger’s method can be regarded as a collocation method\nutilizing the generalized SE-Sinc approximation, namely, SE-Sinc-collocation method.\n\n\n10\nT. OKAYAMA\n4.2. Sinc-collocation method by Rashidinia and Zarebnia. Rashidinia\nand Zarebnia derived their method by the standard collocation procedure, but they\nconsidered their approximated solution wRZ\nN in diﬀerent manners in the following four\ncases.\n(I) If u(a) = u(b) = 0, set wRZ\nN as\nw\nRZ\nN (t) =\nN\nX\nj=−N\ncjS(j, h)(φ\nSE(t)).\n(II) If u(a) ̸= 0 and u(b) = 0, set wRZ\nN as\nw\nRZ\nN (t) = c−Nωa(t) +\nN\nX\nj=−N+1\ncjS(j, h)(φ\nSE(t)).\n(III) If u(a) = 0 and u(b) ̸= 0, set wRZ\nN as\nw\nRZ\nN (t) =\nN−1\nX\nj=−N\ncjS(j, h)(φ\nSE(t)) + cNωb(t).\n(IV) If u(a) ̸= 0 and u(b) ̸= 0, set wRZ\nN as\n(4.3)\nw\nRZ\nN (t) = c−Nωa(t) +\nN−1\nX\nj=−N+1\ncjS(j, h)(φ\nSE(t)) + cNωb(t).\nTo obtain the unknown coeﬃcients cn = [c−N, c−N+1, . . . , cN]T, where n = 2N + 1,\nthey substituted wRZ\nN into the given equation (1.1), with approximating the Volterra\nintegral operator V by V SE\nN . Then, setting n sampling points at t = tSE\ni\n(i = −N, −N +\n1, . . . , N), they derived a system of linear equations in each of the four cases: (I)–(IV).\nFor example, in the case (I), the resulting system is expressed as\n(In −V\nSE\nn )cn = g\nSE\nn .\nParticularly, in the case (IV), the resulting system is expressed as\n(4.4)\n(E\nRZ\nn −V\nRZ\nn )cn = g\nSE\nn ,\nwhere ERZ\nn\nand V RZ\nn\nare n × n matrices deﬁned by\nE\nRZ\nn =\n\n\nωa(tSE\n−N)\n0\n· · ·\n0\nωb(tSE\n−N)\nωa(tSE\n−N+1)\n1\nO\nωb(tSE\n−N+1)\n...\n...\n...\nωa(tSE\nN−1)\nO\n1\nωb(tSE\nN−1)\nωa(tSE\nN )\n0\n· · ·\n0\nωb(tSE\nN )\n\n\n,\nV\nRZ\nm =\n\n\n· · ·\nk(tSE\n−N, tSE\nj ){ψSE}′(jh)hδ(−1)\n−N−j\n· · ·\n· · ·\nk(tSE\n−N+1, tSE\nj ){ψSE}′(jh)hδ(−1)\n−N+1−j\n· · ·\npRZ\nn\n...\nqRZ\nn\n· · ·\nk(tSE\nN−1, tSE\nj ){ψSE}′(jh)hδ(−1)\nN−1−j\n· · ·\n· · ·\nk(tSE\nN , tSE\nj ){ψSE}′(jh)hδ(−1)\nN−j\n· · ·\n\n\n,\n\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO SINC-COLLOCATION METHODS\n11\nwhere pRZ\nn and qRZ\nn are n-dimensional vectors deﬁned by\np\nRZ\nn = [V\nSE\nN [ωa](t\nSE\n−N), V\nSE\nN [ωa](t\nSE\n−N+1), . . . , V\nSE\nN [ωa](t\nSE\nN )]T,\nq\nRZ\nn = [V\nSE\nN [ωb](t\nSE\n−N), V\nSE\nN [ωb](t\nSE\n−N+1), . . . , V\nSE\nN [ωb](t\nSE\nN )]T.\nThis is the SE-Sinc-collocation method by Rashidinia and Zarebnia. In the case (I),\nthe following error analysis was provided.\nTheorem 4.1 (Zarebnia and Rashidinia [17, Theorem 3]).\nLet α and d be posi-\ntive constants with d < π. Assume that the solution u in (1.1) satisﬁes all the assump-\ntions in Theorem 2.1. Furthermore, assume that k(t, ·) satisﬁes all the assumptions\nin Theorem 2.2 for all t ∈[a, b]. Then, there exists a constant C independent of N\nsuch that\n∥u −w\nRZ\nN ∥C([a,b]) ≤C∥(In −V\nSE\nn )−1∥2\n√\nN e−\n√\nπdαN .\nHowever, this theorem does not prove the convergence of wRZ\nN , because there exists\nan unestimated term ∥(In −V SE\nn )−1∥2, which clearly depends on N. For the cases\n(II)–(IV), no error analysis has been provided thus far.\nMoreover, in a practical situation, it is hard to determine whether u is zero or\nnot at the endpoints.\nThis is because the solution u is an unknown function to\nbe determined. The idea to address the issue was presented for Fredholm integral\nequations [8]; set the approximate solution wRZ\nN as (4.3) in any cases. In other words,\nwe may treat the case (IV) as a general case. This idea can be employed for Volterra\nintegral equations (1.1). Therefore, as a method by Rashidinia and Zarebnia, this\nstudy adopts the following procedure: (i) solve the linear system (4.4), and (ii) obtain\nthe approximate solution by (4.3).\n4.3. Main result 1: Relationship between the two methods and their\nconvergence. Any relationship between Stenger’s method (vSE\nN ) and Rashidinia–\nZarebnia’s method (wRZ\nN ) has not been investigated thus far. Furthermore, conver-\ngence of the two methods has not been rigorously proved. As a ﬁrst contribution of\nthis paper, we show the relationship between the two methods as follows. The proof\nis provided in subsection 7.1.\nTheorem 4.2. Let vSE\nN be a function deﬁned by (4.1), where uSE\nn is determined by\nsolving the linear system (3.3). Furthermore, let wRZ\nN be a function deﬁned by (4.3),\nwhere cm is determined by solving the linear system (4.4). Then, it holds that\nv\nSE\nN (t\nSE\ni ) = w\nRZ\nN (t\nSE\ni ),\ni = −N, −N + 1, . . . , N,\nbut generally vSE\nN ̸= wRZ\nN .\nSubsequently, we provide the convergence theorems of the two methods as follows.\nTheir proofs are provided in subsections 7.2 and 7.3.\nTheorem 4.3. Let α and d be positive constants with α ≤1 and d < π. Assume\nthat all the assumptions on g and k in Theorem 3.1 are fulﬁlled. Furthermore, assume\nthat g and k(·, w) belong to Mα(ψSE(Dd)) for all w ∈ψSE(Dd). Let h be selected by\nthe formula (2.6). Then, there exists a positive integer N0 such that for all N ≥N0,\nthe coeﬃcient matrix (In −V SE\nn ) is invertible. Furthermore, there exists a constant C\nindependent of N such that for all N ≥N0,\n∥u −v\nSE\nN ∥C([a,b]) ≤C\n√\nN e−\n√\nπdαN .\n\n\n12\nT. OKAYAMA\nTheorem 4.4. Assume that all the assumptions of Theorem 4.3 are fulﬁlled.\nThen, there exists a positive integer N0 such that for all N ≥N0, the coeﬃcient\nmatrix (ERZ\nn −V RZ\nn ) is invertible. Furthermore, there exists a constant C independent\nof N such that for all N ≥N0,\n∥u −w\nRZ\nN ∥C([a,b]) ≤C\n√\nN e−\n√\nπdαN .\nRemark 4.5. In view of Theorems 4.1 and 4.4, one might assume that Theorem 4.3\nis proved by bounding ∥(In −V SE\nn )−1∥2 uniformly for N. However, this is not the\ncase; see section 7 for details.\nTheorems 4.3 and 4.4 reveal that both methods achieve the same convergence\nrate. Therefore, users may prefer Stenger’s method because the implementation of\nthe method by Rashidinia and Zarebnia is rather complicated. This complication also\ncauses diﬃculty in extension to the system of Volterra integral equations. For this\nreason, in the next section, we consider the improvement of Stenger’s method.\n5. Sinc-collocation method combined with the DE transformation. The\nSE-Sinc-collocation method described in the previous section employs the tanh trans-\nformation as a variable transformation. In this section, a new method is derived by\nreplacing the tanh transformation with the DE transformation. Then, its convergence\ntheorem is stated.\n5.1. Derivation of the DE-Sinc-collocation method. First, solve the linear\nsystem (3.5) and obtain uDE\nn . Then, the approximated solution vDE\nN\nis expressed as\nthe generalized DE-Sinc approximation of uDE\nN , i.e.,\nv\nDE\nN (t) = P\nDE\nN [u\nDE\nN ](t)\n(5.1)\n=\nN\nX\nj=−N\n\b\nu\nDE\nN (t\nDE\nj ) −u\nDE\nN (t\nDE\n−N)ωa(t\nDE\nj ) −u\nDE\nN (t\nDE\nN )ωb(t\nDE\nj )\n\t\nS(j, h)(φ\nDE(t))\n+ u\nDE\nN (t\nDE\n−N)ωa(t) + u\nDE\nN (t\nDE\nN )ωb(t),\nwhere P DE\nN\nis deﬁned by (2.12).\nThis procedure is referred to as the DE-Sinc-\ncollocation method.\n5.2. Main result 2: Convergence of the DE-Sinc-collocation method.\nIn this paper, we show the convergence of the DE-Sinc-collocation method as follows.\nThe proof is provided in section 8.\nTheorem 5.1. Let α and d be positive constants with α ≤1 and d < π/2. Assume\nthat all the assumptions on g and k in Theorem 3.2 are fulﬁlled. Furthermore, assume\nthat g and k(·, w) belong to Mα(ψDE(Dd)) for all w ∈ψDE(Dd). Let h be selected by\nthe formula (2.10). Then, there exists a positive integer N0 such that for all N ≥N0,\nthe coeﬃcient matrix (In −V DE\nn ) is invertible. Furthermore, there exists a constant\nC independent of N such that for all N ≥N0,\n∥u −v\nDE\nN ∥C([a,b]) ≤C e−πdN/ log(2dN/α) .\nCompared to Theorems 4.3 and 4.4, we see that the convergence rate given by\nthis theorem is signiﬁcantly improved.\n\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO SINC-COLLOCATION METHODS\n13\n6. Numerical experiments. This section presents numerical results for the\nfollowing ﬁve methods: the SE/DE-Sinc-Nystr¨om methods by Muhammad et al. [5],\nthe SE-Sinc-collocation methods by Stenger [13] and Rashidinia–Zarebnia [12], and\nthe DE-Sinc-collocation methods by this paper. The computation was performed on\na MacBook Air computer with 1.7 GHz Intel Core i7 with 8 GB memory, running\nmacOS Big Sur. The computation programs were implemented in the C program-\nming language with double-precision ﬂoating-point arithmetic, and compiled with\nApple clang version 13.0.0 with no optimization. Cephes Math Library was used for\ncomputation of the sine integral. LAPACK in Apple’s Accelerate framework was used\nfor computation of the system of linear equations. The source code for all programs\nis available at https://github.com/okayamat/sinc-colloc-volterra.\nWe consider the following two equations (taken from Rashidinia–Zarebnia [12,\nExample 4] and Polyanin–Manzhirov [11, Equation 2.1.45]):\nu(t) +\nZ t\n0\ntsu(s) ds = e−t2 + t\n2(1 −e−t2),\n0 ≤t ≤1,\n(6.1)\nu(t) −6\nZ t\n0\n(\n√\nt −√s)u(s) ds = 1 +\n√\nt −2t\n√\nt −t2,\n0 ≤t ≤1,\n(6.2)\nwhose solutions are u(t) = e−t2 and u(t) = 1 +\n√\nt, respectively. In the case of (6.1),\nthe assumptions of Theorems 3.1, 4.3, and 4.4 are fulﬁlled with d = 3.14 and α = 1,\nand those of Theorems 3.2 and 5.1 are fulﬁlled with d = 1.57 and α = 1. In the case\nof (6.2), the assumptions of Theorems 3.1, 4.3, and 4.4 are fulﬁlled with d = 3.14 and\nα = 1/2, and those of Theorems 3.2 and 5.1 are fulﬁlled with d = 1.57 and α = 1/2.\nTherefore, those values were used for implementation. The errors were evaluated at\n2048 equally spaced points over the given interval, and the maximum error among\nthem was plotted on the graph in Figures 1 to 4.\nFrom all ﬁgures, we can observe that the SE-Sinc-collocation methods by Stenger\nand Rashidinia–Zarebnia yield almost the same performance. This result coincides\nwith Theorems 4.3 and 4.4. From Figure 1, we can observe that the SE/DE-Sinc-\nNystr¨om methods are slightly better than the SE/DE-Sinc-collocation methods with\nrespect to N. This result coincides with Theorems 3.1, 3.2, 4.3, 4.4, and 5.1. How-\never, Figure 2 shows that with respect to the computation time, the SE/DE-Sinc-\ncollocation methods demonstrate signiﬁcantly better performance than the SE/DE-\nSinc-Nystr¨om methods. This is because the SE/DE-Sinc-Nystr¨om methods include\na special function as well as given functions k and g in the basis functions of their\napproximate solutions. We note that the performance of the SE/DE-Sinc-collocation\nmethods in Figure 3 reduced than that in Figure 1, which is due to the diﬀerence of\nα.\n7. Proofs for the theorems presented in section 4.

On (7.1), the following result was obtained.\nLemma 7.2 (Okayama et al. [10, Lemma 6.7]). Assume that all the assumptions\nof Theorem 3.1 are fulﬁlled. Then, there exists a positive integer N0 such that for\nall N ≥N0, (7.1) has a unique solution uSE\nN ∈C([a, b]). Furthermore, there exists a\nconstant C independent of N such that for all N ≥N0,\n(7.5)\n∥u −u\nSE\nN ∥C([a,b]) ≤C∥Vu −V\nSE\nN u∥C([a,b]).\nThis lemma says that (7.1) has a unique solution for all suﬃciently large N. Using\nthis result, we show the following three things:\n(i) If (7.1) has a unique solution, then (7.2) has also a unique solution v = vSE\nN .\n(ii) If (7.1) has a unique solution, then (7.3) has also a unique solution w = wRZ\nN .\n(iii) The two solutions vSE\nN and wRZ\nN are not generally equivalent, but at the collo-\ncation points, vSE\nN (tSE\ni ) = wRZ\nN (tSE\ni ) (i = −N, . . . , N) holds.\nFirst, we show (i) as follows.\nLemma 7.3. The following two statements are equivalent:\n(A) Equation (7.1) has a unique solution uSE\nN ∈C([a, b]).\n(B) Equation (7.2) has a unique solution v ∈C([a, b]).\nFurthermore, v = vSE\nN holds.\nProof. First, let us show (A) ⇒(B). Note that V SE\nN P SE\nN f = V SE\nN f holds because\nof the interpolation property P SE\nN [f](tSE\ni ) = f(tSE\ni ) (i = −N, . . . , N). Applying P SE\nN\non the both sides of (7.1), we have\nP\nSE\nN u\nSE\nN = P\nSE\nN (g + V\nSE\nN u\nSE\nN ) = P\nSE\nN (g + V\nSE\nN P\nSE\nN u\nSE\nN ),\nwhich is equivalent to vSE\nN = P SE\nN (g+V SE\nN vSE\nN ) (recall that vSE\nN = P SE\nN uSE\nN ). This equation\nimplies that (7.2) has a solution vSE\nN ∈C([a, b]).\nNext, we show the uniqueness.\nSuppose that (7.2) has another solution ˜v ∈\nC([a, b]). Let us set a function ˜u as ˜u = g + V SE\nN ˜v. Because ˜v is a solution of (7.2), we\nhave\n˜v = P\nSE\nN (g + V\nSE\nN ˜v) = P\nSE\nN ˜u,\nfrom which it holds that\n˜u = g + V\nSE\nN ˜v = g + V\nSE\nN P\nSE\nN ˜u = g + V\nSE\nN ˜u.\nThis equation implies that ˜u is a solution of (7.1). Because the solution of (7.1) is\nunique, ˜u = u holds, from which we have P SE\nN ˜u = P SE\nN u. Thus, we have ˜v = v, which\nshows (B).\nThe above argument is reversible, which proves (B) ⇒(A). Furthermore, in view\nof the proof above, we see v = vSE\nN , which is to be demonstrated.\nNext, for showing (ii), we show the following result. The proof is omitted because\nit goes in the same way as that of Lemma 7.3.\nLemma 7.4. The following two statements are equivalent:\n(A) Equation (7.1) has a unique solution uSE\nN ∈C([a, b]).\n(B) Equation (7.3) has a unique solution w ∈C([a, b]).\nFurthermore, w = P RZ\nN uSE\nN holds.\n\n\n16\nT. OKAYAMA\nTo show (ii) completely, we further have to show w = wRZ\nN , which is done by the\nfollowing result. Noting P RZ\nN [f](tSE\ni ) = f(tSE\ni ) (i = −N, . . . , N), we can prove this\nresult following Atkinson [1, Sect. 4.3], and hence the proof is omitted.\nProposition 7.5. The following two statements are equivalent:\n(A) Equation (7.3) has a unique solution w ∈C([a, b]).\n(B) Equation (4.4) has a unique solution cm ∈Rm.\nFurthermore, w = wRZ\nN holds.\nFrom the above results (i) and (ii), we ﬁnd that vSE\nN = P SE\nN uSE\nN and wRZ\nN = P RZ\nN uSE\nN .\nUsing the interpolation property of P SE\nN and P RZ\nN as\nP\nSE\nN [u\nSE\nN ](t\nSE\ni ) = u\nSE\nN (t\nSE\ni ) = P\nRZ\nN [u\nSE\nN ](t\nSE\ni ),\ni = −N, −N + 1, . . . , N,\nwe have vSE\nN (tSE\ni ) = wRZ\nN (tSE\ni ). However, we note that P SE\nN and P RZ\nN\nis not generally\nequivalent. This can be observed by the limits t →a and t →b as\nlim\nt→a P\nSE\nN [f](t) = f(t\nSE\n−N) ̸= βN = lim\nt→a P\nRZ\nN [f](t),\nlim\nt→b P\nSE\nN [f](t) = f(t\nSE\nN ) ̸= γN = lim\nt→b P\nRZ\nN [f](t).\nThus, we obtain the claim of Theorem 4.2.\n7.2. Proof of Theorem 4.3. The invertibility of (In −V SE\nn ) is already shown\nby Theorem 3.1. Thus, we concentrate on the analysis of the error of vSE\nN . Because\nvSE\nN = P SE\nN uSE\nN , it holds that\nu −v\nSE\nN = u −P\nSE\nN u\nSE\nN = (u −P\nSE\nN u) + P\nSE\nN (u −u\nSE\nN ),\nwhich leads to\n(7.6) ∥u −v\nSE\nN ∥C([a,b]) ≤∥u −P\nSE\nN u∥C([a,b]) + ∥P\nSE\nN ∥L(C([a,b]),C([a,b]))∥u −u\nSE\nN ∥C([a,b]).\nFor the ﬁrst term, we show u ∈Mα(ψSE(Dd)), from which we can use Theorem 2.7.\nFor the purpose, the following theorem is useful.\nTheorem 7.6 (Okayama et al. [10, Theorem 3.2]).\nLet D = ψSE(Dd) or D =\nψDE(Dd).\nAssume that g, k(z, ·) and k(·, w) belong to H∞(D) for all z, w ∈D.\nThen, (1.1) has a unique solution u ∈H∞(D).\nUsing this theorem, we can show the following result.\nTheorem 7.7. Let α be a positive constant with α ≤1.\nAssume that all the\nassumptions of Theorem 7.6 are fulﬁlled.\nFurthermore, assume that g and k(·, w)\nbelong to Mα(D) for all w ∈D. Then, (1.1) has a unique solution u ∈Mα(D).\nProof. According to Theorem 7.6, (1.1) has a unique solution u ∈H∞(D). There-\nfore, we only have to show the H¨older continuity of u at the endpoints.\nUsing\nu = g + Vu, we have\n|u(b) −u(z)|\n=\n\f\f\f\f\f\n \ng(b) +\nZ b\na\nk(b, w)u(w) dw\n!\n−\n\u0012\ng(z) +\nZ z\na\nk(z, w)u(w) dw\n\u0013\f\f\f\f\f\n≤|g(b) −g(z)| +\n\f\f\f\f\f\nZ b\nz\nk(b, w)u(w) dw\n\f\f\f\f\f +\n\f\f\f\f\nZ z\na\n{k(b, w) −k(z, w)} u(w) dw\n\f\f\f\f .\n\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO SINC-COLLOCATION METHODS\n17\nFrom the H¨older continuity of g, the ﬁrst term can be bounded by Lg|b−z|α for some\nconstant Lg. From the boundedness of k and u, the second term can be bounded\nby Lk,u|b −z| for some constant Lk,u. Furthermore, from the boundedness of D and\nα ≤1, we have |b −z| = |b −z|1−α|b −z|α ≤LD|b −z|α for some constant LD. From\nthe H¨older continuity of k and boundedness of u, the third term can be bounded by\n˜Lk,u|b −z|α|z −a| for some constant ˜Lk,u. Furthermore, from the boundedness of D,\nwe have |z −a| ≤˜LD for some constant ˜LD. Thus, there exists a constant L such that\n|u(b) −u(z)| ≤L|b −z|α, which shows the H¨older continuity of u at z = b. The proof\nfor the H¨older continuity at z = a is omitted because it follows the same method as\nthat at z = b. This completes the proof.\nFrom this theorem, we can use Theorem 2.7 for estimating the ﬁrst term of (7.6)\nas\n∥u −P\nSE\nN u∥C([a,b]) ≤C1\n√\nN e−\n√\nπdαN\nfor some constant C1.\nFor the second term, we use the following bound for the\noperator P SE\nN .\nLemma 7.8 (Okayama [7, Lemma 7.2]). Let P SE\nN be deﬁned by (2.11). Then, there\nexists a constant C2 independent of N such that\n∥P\nSE\nN ∥L(C([a,b]),C([a,b])) ≤C2 log(N + 1).\nThe remaining term to be estimated in (7.6) is ∥u −uSE\nN ∥C([a,b]).\nAccording\nto Lemma 7.2, it is estimated as (7.5). Because u ∈H∞(ψSE(Dd)), u satisﬁes the\nassumptions of Theorem 2.2, from which we have\n∥Vu −V\nSE\nN u∥C([a,b]) ≤C3 e−\n√\nπdαN .\nThus, there exists a constant C4 such that\n∥u −v\nSE\nN ∥C([a,b]) ≤C1\n√\nN e−\n√\nπdαN +C2 log(N + 1)C3 e−\n√\nπdαN\n≤C4\n√\nN e−\n√\nπdαN .\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 4.3.\n7.3. Proof of Theorem 4.4. For Theorem 4.4, the invertibility of (ERZ\nn −V RZ\nn )\ncan be shown by combining Lemmas 7.2 and 7.4 and Proposition 7.5.\nThus, we\nconcentrate on the analysis of the error of wRZ\nN . By the triangle inequality, we have\n∥u(t) −w\nRZ\nN (t)∥C([a,b]) ≤∥u(t) −v\nSE\nN (t)∥C([a,b]) + ∥v\nSE\nN (t) −w\nRZ\nN (t)∥C([a,b])\n= ∥u(t) −v\nSE\nN (t)∥C([a,b]) + ∥P\nSE\nN u\nSE\nN (t) −P\nRZ\nN u\nSE\nN (t)∥C([a,b]).\nBecause the ﬁrst term is already estimated by Theorem 4.3, we estimate the second\nterm. For the purpose, the following lemma is essential.\nLemma 7.9. Let P SE\nN : C([a, b]) →C([a, b]) and P RZ\nN\n: C([a, b]) →C([a, b]) be\ndeﬁned by (2.11) and (7.4), respectively. Then, there exists a constant C independent\nof N such that\n∥P\nSE\nN −P\nRZ\nN ∥L(C([a,b]),C([a,b])) ≤\nC\neNh −1 log(N + 1).\n\n\n18\nT. OKAYAMA\nProof. First, it holds for f ∈C([a, b]) that\nP\nSE\nN [f](t) −P\nRZ\nN [f](t)\n= −\nN\nX\nj=−N\n\b\u0000f(t\nSE\n−N) −βN\n\u0001\nωa(t\nSE\nj ) + (f(t\nSE\nN ) −γN) ωb(t\nSE\nj )\n\t\nS(j, h)(φ\nSE(t))\n+\n\u0000f(t\nSE\n−N) −βN\n\u0001\nωa(t) + (f(t\nSE\nN ) −γN) ωb(t).\nHere, noting\n|f(t\nSE\n−N) −βN| = |f(tSE\nN ) −f(tSE\n−N)|\neNh −1\n≤2∥f∥C([a,b])\neNh −1\n,\n|f(t\nSE\nN ) −γN| = |f(tSE\n−N) −f(tSE\nN )|\neNh −1\n≤2∥f∥C([a,b])\neNh −1\n,\nand using ωa(t) + ωb(t) = 1, we have\n∥P\nSE\nN −P\nRZ\nN ∥L(C([a,b]),C([a,b]))\n≤\n2\neNh −1\n\n\n\nN\nX\nj=−N\n\u0000ωa(t\nSE\nj ) + ωb(t\nSE\nj )\n\u0001\n|S(j, h)(φ\nSE(t))| + ωa(t) + ωb(t)\n\n\n\n=\n2\neNh −1\n\n\n\nN\nX\nj=−N\n|S(j, h)(φ\nSE(t))| + 1\n\n\n\n≤\n2\neNh −1\n\u001a 2\nπ (3 + log N) + 1\n\u001b\n,\nwhere the standard bound [13, Problem 3.1.5 (a)] is used for the last inequality. Thus,\nthe claim follows.\nFrom this lemma, substituting (2.6) into h, we estimate the second term as\n∥(P\nSE\nN −P\nRZ\nN )u\nSE\nN ∥C([a,b]) ≤\nC\n1 −e−√\nπd/α log(N + 1) e−√\nπdN/α ∥u\nSE\nN ∥C([a,b]) .\nNoting α ∈(0, 1], we obtain e−√\nπdN/α ≤e−\n√\nπdαN. Furthermore, log(N + 1) ≤\n√\nN\nholds. Hence, the proof is completed if ∥uSE\nN ∥C([a,b]) is uniformly bounded with respect\nto N. This is shown by the following estimate\n∥u\nSE\nN ∥C([a,b]) ≤∥u −u\nSE\nN ∥C([a,b]) + ∥u∥C([a,b]) .\nFrom (7.5) and Theorem 2.2, we see that ∥u −uSE\nN ∥C([a,b]) converges to 0 as N →∞,\nand accordingly it is uniformly bounded. We also see that ∥u∥C([a,b]) is bounded be-\ncause u is continuous on [a, b] from the assumption (see Theorem 7.7). This completes\nthe proof of Theorem 4.4.\n8. Proofs for the theorem presented in section 5. In this section, we pro-\nvide proofs for Theorem 5.1.\n\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO SINC-COLLOCATION METHODS\n19\n8.1. Existence and uniqueness of the approximated equations. In addi-\ntion to the given equation (I −V)u = g, let us consider the following two equations:\n(I −V\nDE\nN )u\nDE\nN = g,\n(8.1)\n(I −P\nDE\nN V\nDE\nN )v = P\nDE\nN g,\n(8.2)\nwhere V DE\nN is deﬁned by\nV\nDE\nN [f](t) =\nN\nX\nj=−N\nk(t, t\nDE\nj )f(t\nDE\nj ){ψ\nDE}′(jh)J(j, h)(φ\nDE(t)),\nand P DE\nN\nare deﬁned by (2.12).\nBecause (8.1) is equivalent to (3.4), the solution\nof (8.1) is the approximate solution of the DE-Sinc-Nystr¨om method. On (8.1), the\nfollowing result was obtained.\nLemma 8.1 (Okayama et al. [10, Lemma 6.10]). Assume that all the assumptions\nof Theorem 3.2 are fulﬁlled. Then, there exists a positive integer N0 such that for all\nN ≥N0, (8.1) has a unique solution uDE\nN\n∈C([a, b]). Furthermore, there exists a\nconstant C independent of N such that for all N ≥N0,\n(8.3)\n∥u −u\nDE\nN ∥C([a,b]) ≤C∥Vu −V\nDE\nN u∥C([a,b]).\nOn (8.2), we can show the following lemma in the same manner as Lemma 7.3\n(hence, the proof is omitted).\nLemma 8.2. The following two statements are equivalent:\n(A) Equation (8.1) has a unique solution uDE\nN ∈C([a, b]).\n(B) Equation (8.2) has a unique solution v ∈C([a, b]).\nFurthermore, v = vDE\nN holds.\nOn the basis of the results, we proceed to analyze the error of vDE\nN next.\n8.2. Proof of Theorem 5.1. In the same manner as (7.6), we have\n(8.4) ∥u−v\nDE\nN ∥C([a,b]) ≤∥u−P\nDE\nN u∥C([a,b]) +∥P\nDE\nN ∥L(C([a,b]),C([a,b]))∥u−u\nDE\nN ∥C([a,b]).\nFor the ﬁrst term, from Theorem 7.7, we can use Theorem 2.8 as\n∥u −P\nDE\nN u∥C([a,b]) ≤C1 e−πdN/ log(2dN/α)\nfor some constant C1.\nFor the second term, we use the following bound for the\noperator P DE\nN .\nLemma 8.3 (Okayama [7, Lemma 7.5]). Let P DE\nN be deﬁned by (2.12). Then, there\nexists a constant C2 independent of N such that\n∥P\nDE\nN ∥L(C([a,b]),C([a,b])) ≤C2 log(N + 1).\nThe remaining term to be estimated in (8.4) is ∥u −uDE\nN ∥C([a,b]).\nAccording\nto Lemma 8.1, it is estimated as (8.3). Because u ∈H∞(ψDE(Dd)), u satisﬁes the\nassumptions of Theorem 2.4, from which we have\n∥Vu −V\nDE\nN u∥C([a,b]) ≤C3\nlog(2dN/α)\nN\ne−πdN/ log(2dN/α) .\n\n\n20\nT.

    "abstract": "Two different Sinc-collocation methods for Volterra integral equations of the\nsecond kind have been independently proposed by Stenger and\nRashidinia--Zarebnia. However, their relationship remains unexplored. This\nstudy theoretically examines the solutions of these two methods, and reveals\nthat they are not generally equivalent, despite coinciding at the collocation\npoints. Strictly speaking, Stenger's method assumes that the kernel of the\nintegral is a function of a single variable, but this study theoretically\njustifies the use of his method in general cases, i.e., the kernel is a\nfunction of two variables. Then, this study rigorously proves that both methods\ncan attain the same, root-exponential convergence. In addition to the\ncontribution, this study improves Stenger's method to attain significantly\nhigher, almost exponential convergence. Numerical examples supporting the\ntheoretical results are also provided.",
