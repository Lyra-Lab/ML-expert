Here, we develop a theory of slidetronics based on the notion that sliding-\ninduced switching 𝑷⟶𝑷′ can also be achieved by applying an appropriate point-group operator \n𝐺 to the entire system, such that 𝑷′ = 𝐺𝑷. Interlayer sliding and the transformation induced by the \n“generator” 𝐺 are thus equivalent in describing the relationship between the initial and final layer \nconfigurations. From this symmetry principle, we deduce that slidetronics can be classified by \ngenerators 𝐺; the generator 𝐺 must act as a symmetry operator for the constituent layers, while it \nis not a symmetry operator for the stacked layers as a whole; for a given 2D material, 𝐺 determines \nthe interlayer sliding required for polarization switching; and sliding-induced complete \npolarization inversion is impossible in bilayers but can be realized in multilayers (e.g., PdSe2 \ntrilayers). These findings provide a framework for designing 2D ferroelectrics with targeted \npolarization-switching properties, as demonstrated through case studies of real materials. \n\n\n                                                                     2 \nIntroduction. Interlayer sliding within two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals layers provides a \nunique symmetry-breaking mechanism for realizing 2D ferroelectricity (FE). Sliding-induced \npolarization switching [1–18] was first proposed by Li and Wu in 2017 [1] using bilayers of \nhexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as model systems. \nThe energy barriers for such lateral shifts are small, typically a few meV per unit cell [1,3], \nresulting in low critical electric fields for polarization switching. Recent experiments confirmed \nroom-temperature FE in h-BN bilayers [8–10] and TMD bilayers and multilayers [11–18]. \nThe crystal symmetry of 2D materials dictates which components of electric polarization are \nallowed and which are forbidden by symmetry constraints. In a recent pioneering work, Ji et al. [5] \nperformed a comprehensive group theory analysis to identify all possible polar types for bilayer \nsystems based on the 80 layer groups of constituent monolayers. They classified 2D systems into \nfour polar types: in-plane polarization (IP), out-of-plane polarization (OP), combined polarization \n(CP) with both in-plane and out-of-plane components, and nonpolar (NP). For example, the group \ntheory analysis showed that a bilayer composed of monolayers with layer group 55 cannot exhibit \nIP but can achieve other polar types (i.e., OP, CP, and NP) through specific stacking operations. \nThis classification theory, while limited to bilayers, represents a milestone in 2D FE research. \nHowever, when applied to the design of new 2D materials for slidetronics, this approach has \nlimitations. While the previous study focuses on identifying possible polar types (IP, OP, CP, and \nNP) for a given bilayer system, slidetronics concerns the transformations between pairs of 2D \nlayer configurations and the associated changes in polarization. Not all polar bilayer systems \nexhibit sliding FE, as this phenomenon relies on polarization induced by interlayer interactions. \nFurthermore, among the polarization components arising from interlayer interactions, only some \nare switchable through lateral shifts of the stacked layers. As a complementary theoretical \nframework, a theory of slidetronics should address the following critical questions:    \n(1) Which polarization components of a given layered system are switchable for sliding FE? \n(2) How can these active components be switched through specific interlayer sliding motions? \n\n\n                                                                     3 \n(3) For a given structure, is there a definitive algorithm to identify all sliding-switchable phases \nwith distinct electric polarizations? \n(4) Is there a critical number of layers required for certain types of polarization switching? \n(5) What are the design principles for 2D ferroelectrics with targeted polarization-switching \nproperties? \nHere, we address these fundamental questions (Q1–Q5) by developing a general theory of \nslidetronics, based on the notion that sliding-induced polarization switching can also occur without \ninterlayer sliding. For any polarization switching in slidetronics, there always exists an appropriate \npoint-group operator 𝐺 such that 𝑷′ = 𝐺𝑷. This implies that the sliding-induced structural \ntransformation can be achieved by applying the operator 𝐺, referred to as a “generator”, to the \nentire system. Conceptually, interlayer sliding and the transformation induced by 𝐺 are equivalent \nin describing the relationship between the initial and final phases of the transformation. From this \nsymmetry principle, we deduce key properties of sliding FE: slidetronics can be classified by \ngenerators 𝐺; the generator 𝐺 must act as a symmetry operator for the constituent layers, while it \nis not a symmetry operator for the stacked layers as a whole; for a given 2D material, 𝐺 determines \nthe interlayer sliding required for polarization transformation; and sliding-induced complete \npolarization inversion, corresponding to 𝐺= 𝐼 (inversion), is impossible in bilayer systems but \ncan be realized in trilayer systems. These findings enable the design of materials with targeted \npolarization-switching properties. Key predictions include in-plane polarization switching in \nAs2S3/As2Se3 heterobilayers, dipole locking in cellulose bilayers, and complete polarization \ninversion in PdSe2 trilayers, all validated by density-functional theory (DFT) calculations.  \nSymmetry principle. For the sake of definiteness, we consider a bilayer 𝔹 with an electric \npolarization 𝑷= (𝑃*, 𝑃,, 𝑃-. and want to transform it into 𝑷′ = (𝑃*, −𝑃,, −𝑃-.. A straightforward \napproach is to rotate the entire system 𝔹 around the x-axis by 180° [Fig. 1(a)], such that 𝔹⟶𝐶1*𝔹 \nand 𝑷′ = 𝐶1*𝑷. At the core of sliding FE is the symmetry principle that if the bilayer 𝔹 has the \nright crystal structure, the rotated bilayer 𝐶1*𝔹 can be equivalently generated by laterally shifting \n\n\n                                                                     4 \none of the two parallel layers in 𝔹 [Fig. 1(a)]. That is, 𝔹⟶𝑇345𝔹, where 𝑇345 is an operator that \ninduces interlayer sliding at sub-unit cell scales. Since 𝐶1*𝔹 and 𝑇345𝔹 represent two different \nperspectives of the same system, 𝑇345𝔹 must also exhibit the switched polarization 𝑷′ = 𝐶1*𝑷. \nThe bilayer systems 𝔹 and 𝑇345𝔹 correspond to two stable phases on the free-energy surface in \nFig. 1(a), exhibiting different polarizations, 𝑷 and 𝐶1*𝑷, respectively.  \nIn the above example, the sliding-induced transformation, 𝑷\n6789\n:⎯<𝐶1*𝑷, is “generated” by the \nrotation operator 𝐶1*. More generally, other point-group operators can serve as a generator 𝐺 of \nthe polarization transformation 𝑷\n6789\n:⎯< 𝐺𝑷. For a given 𝐺, the condition for sliding FE is given by \n𝐺𝔹= 𝑇(𝝉)[𝑇345𝔹],                  (1)  \nwhere 𝑇(𝝉) denotes a translation of the system 𝑇345𝔹 by a vector 𝝉. To satisfy this condition, the \n“rotated” system 𝐺𝔹 must remain parallel to the original system 𝔹. Consequently, for a vertically \nstacked system, the generator 𝐺 is restricted to the following set of point-group operators: \n{𝐺} = D𝐼, 𝑀-, 𝐶F-, 𝑆F-, 𝑀H, 𝐶1IJ,            (2) \nwhere 𝐼 represents inversion, and 𝑀- denotes a mirror reflection with respect to the plane at z = 0. \nThe operator 𝐶F- (𝑆F-) represents an n-fold proper (improper) rotation around the z-axis. For a \ndirection 𝛼 (or 𝛽) lying in the x-y plane, 𝑀H denotes a reflection across a plane normal to 𝛼, while \n𝐶1I denotes a two-fold rotation around an axis in the direction 𝛽. \nTherefore, any polarization switching 𝑷\n6789\n:⎯< 𝐺𝑷 in slidetronics can be labeled by a generator 𝐺 \nfrom the set in Eq. (2). In Fig. 1(b), we classify slidetronics into four types based on how sliding-\ninduced changes in 𝑷 occur. When 𝐺= 𝑀-, only the out-of-plane polarization 𝑃- undergoes a sign \nchange, while the in-plane polarization remains unaffected (type I). If 𝐺∈{𝑀H, 𝐶F-}, interlayer \nsliding affects only the in-plane polarization (type II). When 𝐺∈D𝐶1I, 𝑆F-J, the out-of-plane and \nin-plane polarization components are interlocked (type III), allowing the in-plane polarization to \nbe switched by an out-of-plane electric field and vice versa. Finally, if possible, choosing 𝐺= 𝐼 \n\n\n                                                                     5 \n(inversion) would lead to a complete inversion of polarization induced by interlayer sliding (type \nIV). However, as we will show later, type-IV sliding FE is impossible in bilayer systems. \nTheory. Building on the symmetry principle expressed in Eq. (1), we develop a general \ntheoretical framework for slidetronics. To achieve this, we first define stacking operations for 2D \nlayered systems. A bilayer system 𝔹 is constructed by stacking a top monolayer 𝕄O onto a bottom \nmonolayer 𝕄P, with its position determined by an in-plane translation vector 𝝉*,\nO  and an out-of-\nplane translation vector 𝝉-\nO. The bilayer 𝔹 can be represented as 𝔹= 𝕄P + 𝑇(𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-\nO.𝕄O. The \ntranslation operator 𝑇 satisfies 𝑇(𝝉R + 𝝉1) = 𝑇(𝝉R)𝑇(𝝉1) and thus commutes, i.e., 𝑇(𝝉R)𝑇(𝝉1) =\n𝑇(𝝉1)𝑇(𝝉R). In a homobilayer system, 𝕄P and 𝕄O can still differ. For example, given 𝕄P = 𝕄, \nthe top layer could be 𝕄O = 𝐼𝕄 or 𝕄O = 𝐶S-𝕄. More generally, 𝕄O = 𝑂O𝕄, where 𝑂O is a point-\ngroup operator that transforms 𝕄 into 𝑂O𝕄 while preserving its parallel orientation. If 𝑂O = 𝐸 (the \nidentity operator), then 𝕄P = 𝕄O = 𝕄. For a bilayer 𝔹, the sliding operator 𝑇345 in Eq. (1) is \ndefined as 𝑇345𝔹= 𝕄P + 𝑇(𝝉345\nO\n)𝑇(𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-\nO.𝕄O, where 𝑇(𝝉345\nO\n) acts solely on the top layer 𝕄O, \nwith 𝝉345\nO\n representing the interlayer sliding vector. \nWe present the symmetry conditions for the constituent monolayers 𝕄P and 𝕄O in a bilayer 𝔹 \nand the equation for the interlayer sliding vector 𝝉345\nO\n (see Methods for derivation). As illustrated \nin Fig. 1(c), the generator 𝐺 must act as a symmetry operator for the constituent layers, while it is \nnot a symmetry operator for the stacked layers as a whole. Equation (1) has two possible solutions, \ndepending on whether 𝐺 flips the sign of the z-component 𝑃- in the transformation 𝑷\n6789\n:⎯< 𝐺𝑷. Thus, \nwe divide the set {𝐺} in Eq. (2) into two categories, 𝐺V ∈{𝑀H, 𝐶F-} and 𝐺W ∈{𝐼, 𝐶1I, 𝑀-, 𝑆F-}, \naccording to their transformation properties: 𝐺V𝒛Y = 𝒛Y and 𝐺W𝒛Y = −𝒛Y for the unit vector 𝒛Y.  \nThe necessary conditions for sliding FE in a bilayer 𝔹 are summarized as follows: \n(i) Case of 𝑮V ∈{𝑴𝜶, 𝑪𝒏𝒛}: The generator 𝐺V of polarization transformation must also act as \na symmetry operator of the constituent monolayers in the bilayer 𝔹:  \n𝐺V𝕄P = 𝑇(𝝉PP)𝕄P and 𝐺V𝕄O = 𝑇(𝝉OO)𝕄O             (3a) \n\n\n                                                                     6 \nfor translation vectors 𝝉PP and 𝝉OO, respectively. The sliding vector 𝝉345\nO\n in 𝔹⟶𝑇345𝔹 is given as \n𝝉345\nO\n= 𝐺V𝝉*,\nO\n−𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉OO −𝝉PP mod (𝒂R, 𝒂1),             (3b)  \nwhich is determined only up to integer multiplies of the lattice vectors 𝒂R and 𝒂1 of the 2D system.  \n(ii) Case of 𝑮W ∈{𝑰, 𝑪𝟐𝜷, 𝑴𝒛, 𝑺𝒏𝒛}: For a generator 𝐺W, equation (1) implies that 𝐺W converts \nthe bottom layer 𝕄P into the top layer 𝕄O, and vice versa, \n𝐺W𝕄P = 𝑇(𝝉PO)𝕄O and 𝐺W𝕄O = 𝑇(𝝉OP)𝕄P             (4a) \nfor translation vectors 𝝉PO and 𝝉OP, respectively. The interlayer sliding vector 𝝉345\nO\n is then given as \n𝝉345\nO\n= −𝐺W𝝉*,\nO\n−𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉PO −𝝉OP mod (𝒂R, 𝒂1).          (4b) \nThere are two things to note on 𝝉345\nO\n in Eqs. (3b) and (4b). If equation (1) holds with 𝝉345\nO\n= 𝟎 \nmod (𝒂R, 𝒂1), no interlayer sliding occurs, meaning that the transformation no longer describes \nsliding FE. Instead, the operator 𝐺 serves as a symmetry operator for the bilayer 𝔹 as a whole, \nrestricting the polarization 𝑷 through the relation 𝐺𝑷= 𝑷. Additionally, the sliding vector 𝝉345\nO\n \nremains invariant under changes in the origin of point-group operators (such as 𝐺 and the 𝑂O of \nthe stacking operation), while all other translation vectors depend on the choice of the origin. \nAs a simple example, we consider a bilayer of h-BN. For h-BN monolayers 𝕄, the in-plane \ntranslation vector in the bilayer 𝔹= 𝕄+ 𝑇(𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-\nO.𝕄 is given by 𝝉*,\nO\n= −𝝉ij, where 𝝉ij is a \nvector that points along a B–N bond in 𝕄. For 𝐺W = 𝑀-, equation (4a) is satisfied since 𝑀- is a \nsymmetry operator for the monolayer 𝕄. According to Eq. (4b), we obtain 𝝉345\nO\n= 𝑀-𝝉ij + 𝝉ij =\n2𝝉ij. Since 𝝉345\nO\n≠𝟎 mod (𝒂R, 𝒂1), type-I sliding FE is realized with 𝐺W = 𝑀-, resulting in 𝑃-\nmn\n:< −𝑃-. However, the h-BN bilayer cannot support other types of slidetronics. For instance, to \nachieve type-II sliding FE, we could choose 𝐺V = 𝐶op, which satisfies Eq. (3a). From Eq. (3b), \nthe corresponding sliding vector would be 𝝉345\nO\n= −𝐶op𝝉ij + 𝝉ij, which is equal to a lattice \nvector of 𝕄, violating the necessary condition 𝝉345\nO\n≠𝟎 mod (𝒂R, 𝒂1) for sliding FE. \n\n\n                                                                     7 \nThe symmetry principle developed for bilayer systems 𝔹 can be extended to trilayer systems \n𝕋. The conditions for sliding FE in trilayers, derived from the symmetry relation 𝐺𝕋=\n𝑇(𝝉)[𝑇345𝕋], are discussed in Methods (see ‘Theory for trilayer systems’). \nApplications. The results presented in Eqs. (1)–(4) provide a theoretical framework for \nunderstanding sliding FE in 2D layered materials. The applications of our theory are two-fold.  \nFirst, for a given layered system, it enables the automatic identification of all sliding-\nswitchable phases with distinct polarizations, which is particularly useful for high-throughput \nsearches of sliding ferroelectrics. A definitive algorithm, described below, reveals the structure–\nproperty relationships and addresses questions Q1–Q3 posed in the Introduction.  \nSecond, our theory offers practical guidance for designing new sliding ferroelectrics with \ntargeted polarization-switching properties. For instance, we mathematically prove that complete \npolarization inversion (type IV) is impossible in bilayer systems but can occur in trilayer systems \n(Q4). Finally, we present three case studies demonstrating how our findings facilitate the design \nof novel sliding ferroelectrics with desired switching properties (Q5).      \nStarting with a stable bilayer phase, we identify all other equally stable, sliding-switchable \nphases with distinct electric polarizations through the following steps (see Supplemental Section \n1 [19] for the discussion on trilayer systems): \n1. Generator selection: Consider a homobilayer phase 𝔹= 𝕄+ 𝑇(𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-O.[𝑂O𝕄], where \n𝕄P = 𝕄 (bottom layer) and 𝕄O = 𝑂O𝕄 (top layer). From the set {𝐺} in Eq. (2), we select all \npossible generators 𝐺 that satisfy the conditions in Eqs. (3a) and (4a). Specifically, if 𝐺= 𝐺V, both \n𝐺V and 𝑂O\nWR𝐺V𝑂O must be symmetry operators of the monolayer 𝕄. If 𝐺= 𝐺W, both 𝐺W𝑂O and \n𝑂O\nWR𝐺W must act as symmetry operators of 𝕄.  \n2. Sliding vector calculation: For each selected generator 𝐺, we calculate the corresponding \ninterlayer sliding vector 𝝉345\nO\n(𝐺) using Eqs. (3b) and (4b).  \n\n\n                                                                     8 \n3. Final generator selection: We retain only those generators for which 𝝉345\nO\n(𝐺) ≠\n𝟎 mod (𝒂R, 𝒂1). If multiple generators have the same interlayer sliding vector, i.e., 𝝉345\nO\n(𝐺) =\n𝝉345\nO\n(𝐺r) mod (𝒂R, 𝒂1), we keep only one of them.  \n4. Polarization transformation: Each remaining generator 𝐺 corresponds to a bilayer phase \n𝑇345(𝐺)𝔹 with a transformed polarization 𝑷r = 𝐺𝑷. \nProof of the impossibility of type-IV slidetronics in bilayer systems. While bilayer systems \ncan exhibit types I, II, and III sliding FE through appropriate selection of constituent monolayers \nand stacking operations, type-IV (dipole inversion) is fundamentally impossible. To prove this, we \napply the dipole-inversion generator 𝐺W = 𝐼 to both sides of the second relation in Eq. (4a), \nyielding 𝐺W𝐺W𝕄O = 𝐺W[𝑇(𝝉OP)𝕄P] = 𝑇(𝐺W𝝉OP)[𝐺W𝕄P], where the last step follows from the \ngeneral rule 𝐺[𝑇(𝝉)𝕃] = 𝑇(𝐺𝝉)[𝐺𝕃] for a layered system 𝕃. Given that 𝐺W𝕄P = 𝑇(𝝉PO)𝕄O in Eq. \n(4a), we obtain 𝐺W𝐺W𝕄O = 𝑇(𝐺W𝝉OP + 𝝉PO)𝕄O. Since 𝐺W𝐺W = 𝐸 and 𝐺W𝝉OP = −𝝉OP for 𝐺W = 𝐼, \nit follows that 𝕄O = 𝑇(−𝝉OP + 𝝉PO)𝕄O , meaning that 𝝉OP = 𝝉PO mod (𝒂R, 𝒂1). Consequently, \nwith 𝐺W = 𝐼, the interlayer sliding vector 𝝉345\nO\n in Eq. (4b) must always be zero. In other words, \nwith nonzero 𝝉345\nO\n, equation (1) has no solution for bilayer systems 𝔹. In contrast, type-IV sliding \nFE is achievable in trilayer systems (see Fig. 4(a) and ‘Case study 3’ below). \nIn the following, we present case studies demonstrating how different types of slidetronics can \nbe realized by designing specific 2D stacked bilayers or trilayers. \nCase study 1: Type-III slidetronics in a cellulose bilayer. As summarized in Fig. 1(b), type-\nIII sliding FE is achievable with a generator 𝐺W ∈D𝐶1I, 𝑆F-J. Here we choose 𝐺W = 𝐶1*. Equation \n(4a) implies that the targeted switching property (dipole locking between 𝑃, and 𝑃-) can be realized \nby vertically stacking two monolayers 𝕄 with 𝐶1* symmetry (i.e., 𝕄O = 𝕄P = 𝕄). As a candidate \nfor 𝕄, we consider a cellulose sheet [20,21], whose atomic structure remains unchanged when first \nrotated 180° around the x-axis and then translated by a fraction of the lattice period 𝝉=\n𝒂t\n1  [Fig. \n2(a)]; that is, 𝕄= 𝑇u\n𝒂t\n1 v [𝐶1*𝕄]. This 𝐶1* symmetry restricts the monolayer polarization 𝑷 to a \n\n\n                                                                     9 \nnonzero 𝑃* component (𝑃, = 𝑃- = 0). However, in a cellulose bilayer [Fig. 2(b)], the y and z \ncomponents of the bilayer polarization can emerge due to interlayer interactions.  \nFigure 2(c) shows the DFT total energy of the bilayer 𝔹= 𝕄+ 𝑇(𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-\nO.𝕄 as a function \nof the translation vector 𝝉*,\nO  (Methods and [22–28]). Two low-energy phases, marked by open \ncircles, were identified. We start with the phase in the right half-plane at 𝝉*,\nO\n=\nRVx\nS 𝒂R + 0.57𝒂1, \nwhere 𝜀= 0.05 denotes a small deviation from \nR\nS in the coefficient of 𝒂R. Since 𝐺W = 𝐶1* and \n𝝉PO = 𝝉OP =\n𝒂t\n1 , it follows from Eq. (4b) that 𝝉345\nO\n= −𝐶1*𝝉*,\nO\n−𝝉*,\nO\n= −\nRVx\n1 𝒂R mod (𝒂R, 𝒂1). \nHence, type-III sliding FE can be achieved with 𝝉345\nO\n= −\nRVx\n1 𝒂R (path 1) or 𝝉345\nO\n=\nRWx\n1 𝒂R (path \n2). The energy barriers are Eb = 3.2 meV/Å2 along path 1 and 4.1 meV/Å2 along path 2.  \nUsing the Berry-phase theory of polarization [29–32], we calculate the bilayer polarization 𝑷 \nas a function of the translation vector 𝝉*,\nO  [Fig. 2(c)]. Since 𝑃* is not switchable (and thus cannot \nbe determined), we instead plot the change in 𝑃* induced by interlayer interactions. The in-plane \npolarizations are represented by arrows, while the out-of-plane component 𝑃- is indicated by the \ncolor of the arrows. As the stacking order shifts from 𝝉*,\nO\n=\nRVx\nS 𝒂R + 0.57𝒂1 to 𝝉*,\nO\n= −\nRVx\nS 𝒂R +\n0.57𝒂1, both 𝑃, and 𝑃- reverse their signs, while 𝑃* remains unchanged. Since 𝑃, is interlocked \nwith 𝑃-, the in-plane polarization 𝑃, can be switched by applying an out-of-plane electric field, and \nvice versa, enabling applications such as switchable ferroelectric diodes [33]. \nCase study 2: Type-II slidetronics in an As2S3 bilayer. The next target property is type-II \nsliding FE, which is achievable with a generator 𝐺V ∈{𝑀H, 𝐶F-} [Fig. 1(b)]. Here, we choose \n𝐺V = 𝑀, and consider an As2S3 bilayer [34,35] because, as required by Eq. (3a), its constituent \nmonolayer 𝕄 has 𝑀, as one of its symmetry operators 𝑆∈D𝑀,, 𝑀-, 𝐶1*J. When the origin is \nchosen as shown in Fig. 3(a), the translation vector 𝛕 in 𝑆𝕄= 𝑇(𝝉)𝕄 is 𝛕= 𝟎 for 𝑆= 𝑀,, and \n𝛕=\n𝒂•\n1  for 𝑆= 𝑀- and 𝐶1*.  \nWe consider a bilayer configuration 𝔹= 𝕄+ 𝑇(𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-O.[𝐼𝕄], where 𝕄P = 𝕄 and 𝕄O =\n𝐼𝕄, obtained by exfoliating bulk As2S3 [34–36]. (See Supplemental Sections 2 and 3 for results \non a different configuration where 𝕄O = 𝕄.) However, this bilayer 𝔹 possesses inversion \n\n\n                                                                     10 \nsymmetry regardless of the choice of 𝝉*,\nO . (Proof: For 𝐺W = 𝐼 (inversion), equation (4a) is satisfied \nwith 𝝉PO = 𝝉OP , and the sliding vector 𝝉345\nO\n in Eq. (4b) becomes 𝝉345\nO\n= −𝐼𝝉*,\nO\n−𝝉*,\nO\n= 𝟎, \nindicating that 𝐼𝑷= 𝑷 and thus 𝑷= 𝟎.) Hence, the As2S3 bilayer 𝔹 is not a sliding FE material. \nOne way to overcome this limitation is to form a heterobilayer composed of As2S3 (𝕄€) and \nAs2Se3 (𝕄€•). In the heterobilayer 𝔹€/€• = 𝕄€ + 𝑇(𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-\nO.[𝐼𝕄€•], the inversion symmetry of \nthe homobilayer 𝔹 is broken, leading to 𝑷= (−0.22, 0.27, 0.85) pC/m in DFT calculations. We \nassume a lattice-matched As2S3/As2Se3 bilayer with the lowest-energy stacking order shown in the \nleft panel of Fig. 3(c). This heterobilayer 𝔹€/€• now supports type-II sliding FE, generated by \n𝐺V = 𝑀, through top-layer sliding with 𝝉345\nO\n= −2𝝉,\nO  along the y-axis [Fig. 3(b)]; i.e., (𝑃*, 𝑃,, 𝑃-.\nm„\n:< (𝑃*, −𝑃,, 𝑃-.. The energy barrier for this transformation is Eb = 5.6 meV/Å2.  \nAnother way to break the inversion symmetry of the homobilayer 𝔹 is to apply an external \nelectric field ℇ- along the vertical direction. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 3(c), in-plane \npolarization is induced by the out-of-plane field ℇ-. The components 𝑃*(ℇ-) and 𝑃,(ℇ-) are odd \nfunctions of ℇ-. When top-layer sliding occurs with 𝝉345\nO\n= −2𝝉,\nO  (corresponding to 𝐺V = 𝑀,) at \na constant ℇ- , the sign of 𝑃,  flips, while 𝑃*  remains unchanged. The energy barrier for the \ninterlayer sliding is Eb = 5.0 meV/Å2 at ℇ- = 0.25 V/Å. \nCase study 3: Type-IV slidetronics in a PdSe2 trilayer. To achieve type-IV sliding FE in a \nhomo-trilayer 𝕋 with the generator 𝐺W = 𝐼, the middle layer 𝕄† in 𝕋 should possess inversion \nsymmetry, as required by Eq. (8a) in Methods [Fig. 1(c)]. Here, we consider a PdSe2 monolayer \n𝕄 [37,38], which is a pentagonal phase having identity E and inversion I as symmetry operators \n[Fig. 4(b)]. The trilayer configuration is designed as 𝕋= 𝕄+ 𝑇(𝝉*,\n† + 𝝉-†.[𝐶S-𝕄] + 𝑇(𝝉*,\nO\n+\n𝝉-O.𝕄, where 𝕄P = 𝕄O = 𝕄 and the middle layer 𝕄† = 𝐶S-𝕄. Although the aspect ratio of the \nPdSe2 unit cell slightly deviates from one (𝑎, 𝑎*\n⁄\n= 1.03), we assume a square lattice for 𝕄 in \nour DFT calculations to maintain lattice matching between the layers. With a Pd atom in 𝕄 as the \ninversion center, we have 𝐼𝕄= 𝕄 and 𝐼(𝐶S-𝕄) = 𝐶S-𝕄, leading to 𝝉PO = 𝝉OP = 𝝉†† = 𝟎 in Eq. \n(8a). From Eqs. (8b) and (8c), the sliding vectors are given by 𝝉345\nO\n= −𝐼𝝉*,\nO\n−𝝉*,\nO\n= 𝟎 for the top \n\n\n                                                                     11 \nlayer and 𝝉345\n† = 𝐼𝝉*,\n† −𝝉*,\n† −𝐼𝝉*,\nO\n= −2𝝉*,\n† + 𝝉*,\nO  for the middle layer. The trilayer 𝕋, shown \nin the left panel of Fig. 4(c), has a polarization 𝑷= (−3.91, 0.42, 1.26) pC/m, while the laterally \nshifted trilayer 𝑇345𝕋, shown in the right panel, exhibits an inverted polarization −𝑷.     \nIn summary, starting from the symmetry relation 𝐺𝕃= 𝑇(𝝉)[𝑇345𝕃] for a layered system 𝕃 \n(e.g., bilayer 𝔹 and trilayer 𝕋), we deduce key properties of sliding FE: (1) slidetronics can be \nclassified by generators 𝐺; (2) the generator 𝐺 must act as a symmetry operator for the constituent \nlayers, while it is not a symmetry operator for the stacked layers as a whole; (3) for a given 2D \nmaterial, 𝐺 determines the interlayer sliding required for polarization transformation; (4) and a \nminimum of three layers is required for sliding-induced dipole inversion. Given a 2D layered \nsystem, a definitive algorithm is devised for the automatic identification of all sliding-switchable \nphases with distinct polarizations, which will be particularly useful for high-throughput searches \nof novel sliding ferroelectrics. Finally, we present three case studies—in-plane polarization \nswitching in As2S3/As2Se3 heterobilayers, dipole locking in cellulose bilayers, and complete \npolarization inversion in PdSe2 trilayers—that illustrate how targeted polarization switching can \nbe achieved through the theory-guided design of 2D layered materials. \nMethods  \nTheory for bilayer systems. In the symmetry principle expressed in Eq. (1), the left-hand side, \n𝐺𝔹, represents the bilayer 𝔹= 𝕄P + 𝑇(𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-O.𝕄O transformed by the generator 𝐺, i.e., 𝐺𝔹=\n𝐺𝕄P + 𝐺Ž𝑇(𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-O.𝕄O•. Using the general rule 𝐺[𝑇(𝝉)𝕃] = 𝑇(𝐺𝝉)[𝐺𝕃], which holds for any \nlayered system 𝕃, we can rewrite this as 𝐺𝔹= 𝐺𝕄P + 𝑇(𝐺𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝐺𝝉-O.[𝐺𝕄O]. As discussed in the \nmain text, we classify the generator 𝐺 into two categories, 𝐺V ∈{𝑀H, 𝐶F-}  and 𝐺W ∈\n{𝐼, 𝐶1I, 𝑀-, 𝑆F-}, depending on whether the operator 𝐺 alters the sign of 𝝉-, i.e., 𝐺±𝝉- = ±𝝉-. \nWith this classification, 𝐺±𝔹 can be expressed as  \n𝐺±𝔹= 𝐺±𝕄P + 𝑇(𝐺±𝝉*,\nO\n± 𝝉-O.[𝐺±𝕄O].          (5) \n\n\n                                                                     12 \nGiven that 𝑇345𝔹= 𝕄P + 𝑇(𝝉345\nO\n)𝑇(𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-\nO.𝕄O and using the property 𝑇(𝝉R)𝑇(𝝉1) = 𝑇(𝝉R +\n𝝉1), the right-hand side of Eq. (1) can be expressed as \n𝑇(𝝉)[𝑇345𝔹] = 𝑇(𝝉)𝕄P + 𝑇(𝝉+ 𝝉345\nO\n+ 𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-\nO.𝕄O.         (6) \nThe symmetry principle, 𝐺±𝔹= 𝑇(𝝉)[𝑇345𝔹], in Eq. (1) must hold for any vertical translation \nvector 𝝉-\nO . To satisfy this condition, the generator 𝐺 must act as a symmetry operator for the \nconstituent layers, while it does not serve as a symmetry operator for the stacked layers as a whole \n[Fig. 1(c)]. Equation (1) has two possible solutions: \n(i) Case of 𝑮V ∈{𝑴𝜶, 𝑪𝒏𝒛}: By equating the right-hand sides of Eqs. (5) and (6) for a generator \n𝐺V, we obtain 𝐺V𝕄P = 𝑇(𝝉)𝕄P  and 𝐺V𝕄O = 𝑇(𝝉+ 𝝉345\nO\n+ 𝝉*,\nO\n−𝐺V𝝉*,\nO .𝕄O . This indicates \nthat when applied to individual monolayers, 𝐺V must act as a symmetry operator. Therefore, the \nsymmetry condition for the constituent monolayers of 𝔹 is given by Eq. (3a), rewritten as \n𝐺V𝕄P = 𝑇(𝝉PP)𝕄P and 𝐺V𝕄O = 𝑇(𝝉OO)𝕄O. Combining these equations, we obtain the equations \nfor the translation vectors: 𝝉= 𝝉PP  and 𝝉OO = 𝝉+ 𝝉345\nO\n+ 𝝉*,\nO\n−𝐺V𝝉*,\nO . Hence, the interlayer \nsliding vector is given by 𝝉345\nO\n= 𝐺V𝝉*,\nO\n−𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉OO −𝝉PP mod (𝒂R, 𝒂1), as given in Eq. (3b).    \n(ii) Case of 𝑮W ∈{𝑰, 𝑪𝟐𝜷, 𝑴𝒛, 𝑺𝒏𝒛}: By equating the right-hand sides of Eqs. (5) and (6) for a \ngenerator 𝐺W, we obtain the relations 𝐺W𝕄P = 𝑇(𝝉+ 𝝉345\nO\n+ 𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-\nO.𝕄O and 𝐺W𝕄O = 𝑇(𝝉−\n𝐺W𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-\nO.𝕄P. This implies that 𝐺W interchanges the bottom layer 𝕄P and the top layer 𝕄O. \nThe symmetry condition for the constituent monolayers is thus given by Eq. (4a), rewritten as \n𝐺W𝕄P = 𝑇(𝝉PO)𝕄O and 𝐺W𝕄O = 𝑇(𝝉OP)𝕄P. Combining these equations, we derive the equations \nfor the translation vectors: 𝝉PO = 𝝉+ 𝝉345\nO\n+ 𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-O  and 𝝉OP = 𝝉−𝐺W𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-O . By solving \nthese equations for the unknown 𝝉 and 𝝉345\nO\n, we obtain the sliding vector 𝝉345\nO\n= −𝐺W𝝉*,\nO\n−𝝉*,\nO\n+\n𝝉PO −𝝉OP mod (𝒂R, 𝒂1), as given in Eq. (4b). \nTheory for trilayer systems. We consider a trilayer system, 𝕋= 𝕄P + 𝑇(𝝉*,\n† + 𝝉-†.𝕄† +\n𝑇(𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-O.𝕄O, which consists of the bottom (b), middle (m), and top (t) monolayers. The laterally \nshifted trilayer is defined as 𝑇345𝕋= 𝕄P + 𝑇(𝝉345\n† )𝑇(𝝉*,\n† + 𝝉-†.𝕄† + 𝑇(𝝉345\nO\n)𝑇(𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-O .𝕄O. \n\n\n                                                                     13 \nThe general principle developed for bilayer systems can be extended to trilayer systems to derive \nthe conditions for sliding FE in trilayers, as summarized below: \n(i) Case of 𝑮V ∈{𝑴𝜶, 𝑪𝒏𝒛}: For 𝐺= 𝐺V, the condition for sliding FE, 𝐺V𝕋= 𝑇(𝝉)[𝑇345𝕋], \nimplies that  \n𝐺V𝕄P = 𝑇(𝝉PP)𝕄P, 𝐺V𝕄† = 𝑇(𝝉††)𝕄†, 𝐺V𝕄O = 𝑇(𝝉OO)𝕄O,       (7a)  \nwhich indicates that 𝐺V  should act as a symmetry operator for individual monolayers. The \ninterlayer sliding vectors are then derived as \n𝝉345\n† = 𝐺V𝝉*,\n† −𝝉*,\n† + 𝝉†† −𝝉PP,               (7b)  \n𝝉345\nO\n= 𝐺V𝝉*,\nO\n−𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉OO −𝝉PP.                 (7c) \n(ii) Case of 𝑮W ∈{𝑰, 𝑪𝟐𝜷, 𝑴𝒛, 𝑺𝒏𝒛}: For 𝐺= 𝐺W, the symmetry relation 𝐺W𝕋= 𝑇(𝝉)[𝑇345𝕋] \nis satisfied only when  \n𝐺W𝕄P = 𝑇(𝝉PO)𝕄O, 𝐺W𝕄† = 𝑇(𝝉††)𝕄†, 𝐺W𝕄O = 𝑇(𝝉OP)𝕄P.        (8a) \nHere, the generator 𝐺W acts as a symmetry operator for the middle layer 𝕄†, while it converts the \nbottom layer 𝕄P into the top layer 𝕄O, and vice versa. The sliding vectors in this case are \n𝝉345\n† = 𝐺W𝝉*,\n† −𝝉*,\n† −𝐺W𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉†† −𝝉OP,        (8b) \n𝝉345\nO\n= −𝐺W𝝉*,\nO\n−𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉PO −𝝉OP.                (8c) \nDFT calculations. The total energies and electronic structures of 2D layered materials were \ncalculated using DFT within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE [22]), as \nimplemented in the Vienna ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP [39,40]). To account for van der \nWaals interactions, we employed Grimme’s DFT-D3 method [41] for 2D systems derived from \nAs2S3, As2Se3, and PdSe2 layers. It was shown that the PBE exchange-correlation potential, \ncombined with Grimme’s DFT-D2 method [42], accurately predicts the cell parameters of bulk \ncellulose phases and the stability of cellulose polymorphs [43]. As in our previous work [21] on \ncellulose nanocrystals, we thus used the PBE-D2 method for cellulose bilayers. Our DFT \n\n\n                                                                     14 \ncalculations utilized the projector augmented wave (PAW) method [27] with an energy cutoff of \n400 eV for the plane-wave part of the wave function. All atomic structures were fully relaxed until \nresidual forces were reduced below 0.05 eV/Å. The nudged elastic band (NEB) method [28] was \nemployed to determine the energy barriers associated with interlayer sliding motions. Electric \npolarization was calculated using the Berry-phase theory of polarization [29–32]. A vacuum size \nof 100 Å was applied to ensure accurate calculations of the z-component polarization values in the \nsupercell simulations of 2D materials. \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was supported by the National Research Foundation grant (No. NRF-\n2022M3D1A1026816) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT of Korea. \n‡These authors contributed equally. \n* joongoo.kang@dgist.ac.kr \n1.

The most stable stacking order is shown in \nSupplemental Fig. S1. Starting with the stable 2D phase, we identify all other equally stable, \nsliding-switchable phases with distinct electric polarizations through the following steps:  \n1. Generator selection: We select all possible generators 𝐺 from the set {𝐺} in Eq. (2) that \nsatisfy the conditions in Eqs. (7a) and (8a) (see Methods). For the As2S3 trilayer 𝕋, there are three \navailable generators: 𝐺∈D𝑀,, 𝑀-, 𝐶1*J. For 𝐺V = 𝑀,, we obtain 𝝉PP = 𝝉†† = 𝝉OO = 𝟎 from Eq. \n(7a). For 𝐺W = 𝑀- and 𝐶1*, we have 𝝉PO = 𝝉OP =\n𝒂•\n1  and 𝝉†† = −\n𝒂•\n1  from Eq. (8a) [Fig. 3(a)]. \n2. Sliding vector calculation: For each selected generator 𝐺, we calculate the sliding vectors \n𝝉345\n† (𝐺) and 𝝉345\nO\n(𝐺) for the middle and top layers. Using Eqs. (7b) and (7c), we find the sliding \nvectors for 𝐺V = 𝑀, as 𝝉345\n† (𝑀,) = 𝑀,𝝉*,\n† −𝝉*,\n† = −2𝝉,\n† and 𝝉345\nO\n(𝑀,) = 𝟎. From Eqs. (8b) \nand (8c), we find the same sliding vectors for 𝐺W = 𝐶1*, i.e., 𝝉345\n† (𝐶1*) = 𝐶1*𝝉*,\n† −𝝉*,\n† −𝒂1 =\n−2𝝉,† and 𝝉345\nO (𝐶1*) = 𝟎. For 𝐺W = 𝑀-, however, we obtain zero sliding vectors, 𝝉345\n† (𝑀-) =\n𝑀-𝝉*,\n† −𝝉*,\n† −𝑀-𝝉*,\nO\n−𝒂1 = 𝟎 and 𝝉345\nO\n(𝑀-) = −𝑀-𝝉*,\nO\n−𝝉*,\nO\n= −2𝝉*,\nO\n= 𝟎.  \n3. Final generator selection: We retain only the generators with nonzero sliding vectors, \nwhich are 𝑀, and 𝐶1* for the As2S3 trilayer 𝕋. If multiple generators have the same interlayer \nsliding vectors, we keep only one of them. Since 𝝉345\n† (𝑀,) = 𝝉345\n† (𝐶1*) and 𝝉345\nO\n(𝑀,) = 𝝉345\nO\n(𝐶1*) \nin this example, we obtain 𝑀,𝑷= 𝐶1*𝑷, indicating that 𝑃- = −𝑃- and thus 𝑃- = 0. Without loss \nof generality, we choose 𝑀,. \n\n\n                                                                     24 \n4. Polarization transformation: Each remaining generator 𝐺 corresponds to a trilayer phase \n 𝑇345(𝐺)𝕋 with a polarization 𝑷r = 𝐺𝑷. In our case with 𝕋= 𝕄+ 𝑇(𝝉*,\n† + 𝝉-\n†.[𝐼𝕄] + 𝑇(𝝉-\nO)𝕄, \nwe have a single generator 𝐺= 𝑀, and the associated sliding vectors 𝝉345\n† = −2𝝉,\n† and 𝝉345\nO\n= 𝟎. \nTherefore, the sliding operation induces a polarization transformation: (𝑃*, 𝑃,, 𝑃-.\nm„\n:< (𝑃*, −𝑃,, 𝑃-.. \nOur DFT calculations yield Py = 1.76 pC/m, while 𝑃- = 0 due to 𝑀- mirror symmetry. However, \n𝑃* cannot be determined because 𝑃* is not switchable. \n \nFIG. S1. Illustration of sliding FE in the As2S3 homo-trilayer.  \nSection S2: Absence of sliding FE in the differently stacked As2S3 homobilayer \nWe consider a stacking configuration, 𝔹r = 𝕄+ 𝑇(𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-O .𝕄, of an As2S3 homobilayer. In \ncontrast to the bilayer 𝔹 discussed in the main text, where 𝕄P = 𝕄 and 𝕄O = 𝐼𝕄, here both \nlayers share the same crystal structure, i.e., 𝕄P = 𝕄O = 𝕄. To satisfy the conditions in Eq. (3a) \nor Eq. (4a), the generator 𝐺 should be chosen from the symmetry operations of the monolayer 𝕄. \nThis restricts the available generators to 𝐺∈D𝑀,, 𝑀-, 𝐶1*J.  \nLet us first consider 𝐺W = 𝐶1*, which satisfies Eq. (4a) with 𝝉PO = 𝝉OP =\n𝒂•\n1 . From Eq. (4b), \nthe sliding vector is given by 𝝉345\nO\n= −𝐶1*𝝉*,\nO\n−𝝉*,\nO\n= −2𝝉*O , where 𝝉*O  is the translation vector \nalong the x-axis. However, due to the symmetry properties of the monolayer 𝕄, it can be shown \n\n\n                                                                     25 \nthat in the most stable configuration of 𝔹r, the translation vector 𝝉*,\nO  lies along the y-axis, i.e., \n𝝉*,\nO\n= 𝝉,\nO  and 𝝉*\nO = 𝟎. This result is confirmed by DFT calculations (Supplemental Fig. S2). \nTherefore, 𝝉345\nO\n= −2𝝉*\nO = 𝟎 for 𝐺W = 𝐶1*, or equivalently, 𝐶1*𝑷= 𝑷, leading to 𝑃, = 𝑃- = 0, \nwhile 𝑃* ≠0. Given the available generators 𝐺∈D𝑀,, 𝑀-, 𝐶1*J, it is impossible to reverse the sign \nof 𝑃*, thereby proving that sliding FE cannot occur in the bilayer configuration 𝔹r.  \n \nFIG. S2. (a) Monolayer structure of As2S3 (𝕄). (b) DFT total energy of the homobilayer 𝔹r =\n𝕄+ 𝑇(𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-\nO.𝕄 as a function of the fractional coordinates X and Y in the translation vector \n𝝉*,\nO\n= X𝒂R + Y(𝒂R + 𝒂1), showing two low-energy phases marked by open circles. The bilayer \npolarization is also plotted on the same X–Y plane. Since 𝑃* is not switchable (and thus cannot be \ndetermined), we instead plot the change in 𝑃* induced by interlayer interactions. The in-plane \npolarization components are indicated by arrows, while the out-of-plane component is represented \nby the color of the arrows. \nSection S3: Type-II sliding FE in the differently stacked As2S3/As2Se3 heterobilayer \nSliding FE can be achieved in a heterobilayer configuration, denoted 𝔹€/€•\nr\n= 𝕄€ +\n𝑇(𝝉*,\nO\n+ 𝝉-O.𝕄€•, composed of As2S3 (𝕄€) and As2Se3 (𝕄€•). Unlike the homobilayer 𝔹r, where \nthe top and bottom layers are identical and preserve 𝐶1* symmetry, this heterobilayer breaks 𝐶1* \n\n\n                                                                     26 \nsymmetry due to the different materials in each layer. This symmetry breaking induces nonzero \npolarization components, Py = 1.76 pC/m and Pz = 0.78 pC/m (Supplemental Fig. S3).  \nIn this heterobilayer, the generators 𝐺W = 𝑀- and 𝐶1* fail to satisfy the condition in Eq. (4a). \nHowever, when using the generator 𝐺V = 𝑀,, the top-layer sliding with 𝝉345\nO\n= −2𝝉,\nO  gives rise \nto type-II sliding FE, characterized by the sign change of 𝑃,. The energy barrier associated with \nthis sliding FE is Eb = 2.2 meV/Å2. \n \nFIG. S3. Illustration of type-II sliding FE in the As2S3/As2Se3 heterobilayer 𝔹€/€•\nr\n. \n\n\n",

    "abstract": "Vertically stacked layers derived from non-ferroelectric monolayers offer a\npromising route to two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics, where polarization\nswitching occurs via interlayer sliding at sub-unit cell scales. Here, we\ndevelop a theory of slidetronics based on the notion that sliding-induced\nswitching $P \\rightarrow P'$ can also be achieved by applying an appropriate\npoint-group operator $G$ to the entire system, such that $P' = G P$. Interlayer\nsliding and the transformation induced by the generator $G$ are thus equivalent\nin describing the relationship between the initial and final layer\nconfigurations. From this symmetry principle, we deduce that slidetronics can\nbe classified by generators $G$; the generator $G$ must act as a symmetry\noperator for the constituent layers, while it is not a symmetry operator for\nthe stacked layers as a whole; for a given 2D material, $G$ determines the\ninterlayer sliding required for polarization switching; and sliding-induced\ncomplete polarization inversion is impossible in bilayers but can be realized\nin multilayers (e.g., PdSe$_2$ trilayers). These findings provide a framework\nfor designing 2D ferroelectrics with targeted polarization-switching\nproperties, as demonstrated through case studies of real materials.",
