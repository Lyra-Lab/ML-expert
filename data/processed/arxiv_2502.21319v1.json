See recent related expositions about this anomaly index −Nf + nνR for examples\nin [4–10]. However, because of the analogous Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies [11, 12] via the SM electroweak gauge\ninstanton [13–16], instead of thinking of the classical lepton number L symmetry, only the baryon number plus or\nminus lepton number B ± L symmetries are physically meaningful quantum mechanical symmetries pertinent in the\nSM:1\n1. For the B −L symmetry, there is a full faithful U(1)B−L symmetry for the gauge-invariant baryons, or an\nunfaithful U(1)Q−NcL symmetry for the gauge-invariant baryons (but U(1)Q−NcL is faithful for the free quarks),\nsurvived under the SM electroweak gauge instanton, see Table I.\n2. For the B + L symmetry, there is a full faithful Z2Nf ,B+L symmetry for the gauge-invariant baryons or an\nunfaithful Z2NcNf ,Q+NcL symmetry for the gauge-invariant baryons (but Z2NcNf ,Q+NcL is faithful for the free\nquarks), survived under the SM electroweak gauge instanton, see Table I.\n¯dR\nlL\nqL\n¯uR\n¯eR = e+\nL ¯νR = νL ϕH\nSU(3)\n3\n1\n3\n3\n1\n1\n1\nSU(2)\n1\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n2\nU(1)Y\n1/3\n−1/2\n1/6\n−2/3\n1\n0\n1/2\nU(1) ˜Y\n2\n−3\n1\n−4\n6\n0\n3\nU(1)EM\n1/3\n0 or −1 2/3 or −1/3 −2/3\n1\n0\n0\nU(1)B−L = U(1)F\n−1/3\n−1\n1/3\n−1/3\n1\n1\n0\nU(1)Q−NcL = U(1)F\n−1\n−3\n1\n−1\n3\n3\n0\nU(1)X = U(1)F\n−3\n−3\n1\n1\n1\n5\n−2\nZ5,X\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n0\n−2\nZ4,X = ZF\n4\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n−2\nZ8,X = ZF\n8\n5\n5\n1\n1\n1\n5\n−2\nZ2Nf =6,B+L = ZF\n6\nfor Nf = 3;\nor ZF\n2 , ZF\n4\nfor Nf = 1, 2\n(broken from U(1)B+L).\n−1/3\n1\n1/3\n−1/3\n−1\n−1\n0\nZ2NcNf =18,Q+NcL = ZF\n18\nfor Nf = 3;\nor ZF\n6 , ZF\n12\nfor Nf = 1, 2\n(broken from U(1)Q+NcL).\n−1\n3\n1\n−1\n−3\n−3\n0\nZF\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\nTABLE I. Follow the convention in [9], we show the representations of quarks and leptons in terms of Weyl fermions in various\ninternal symmetry groups. Each fermion is a spin- 1\n2 Weyl spinor 2L representation of the spacetime symmetry group Spin(1,3).\nEach fermion is written as a left-handed particle ψL or a right-handed anti-particle iσ2ψ∗\nR.\nAlthough including the 16th Weyl fermion can cancel the SM’s anomalies, when the B ± L are preserved only\nas discrete finite subgroups instead of the conventional continuous U(1), the perturbative local anomalies become\n1 In fact, the U(1)B−L is a faithful symmetry for the SM such that there exist gauge-invariant local operators that have a unit U(1)\ncharge. The U(1)Q−NcL is not a faithful symmetry for the SM because there exists no gauge-invariant local operator that has a unit\nU(1) charge; but the gauge-invariant local operator has a minimal Nc = 3 charge. But U(1)Q−NcL is a faithful symmetry for free\nquarks, because there exists a free quark of that unit U(1) charge.\nSimilarly, the Z2Nf ,B+L is a faithful symmetry for the SM such that there exist gauge-invariant local operators that have a unit U(1)\ncharge. The Z2NcNf ,Q+NcL is not a faithful symmetry for the SM because there exists no gauge-invariant local operator that has a\nunit Z2NcNf ,Q+NcL charge; but the gauge-invariant local operator has a minimal Nc = 3 charge. But Z2NcNf ,Q+NcL is a faithful\nsymmetry for free quarks, because there exists a free quark of that unit Z2NcNf ,Q+NcL charge.\nWe thank Yunqin Zheng for enlightening discussions on this issue.\n\n\n3\nnonperturbative global anomalies,2 there are alternative new scenarios that would cancel the (B ± L)-gravitational\nanomaly but in such a novel way as to preserve the discrete (B ± L)-symmetry, see Fig. 1.\nIn this work, we systematically enumerate these gauge-gravitational global anomalies involving discrete B ± L that\nare enhanced from the fermion parity ZF\n2 to ZF\n2N, with N = 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, etc., see Appendix A. 3\n1. Phenomenologically, the discreteness of B −L is either imposed as a discretely dynamically gauged at the high-\nenergy [27] or constrained by the allowed higher-order 2N-body multi-fermion beyond-the-Standard-Model\n(BSM) deformations. More precisely, we really require the X symmetry [28–30]\nX ≡5(B −L) −2\n3\n˜Y ≡\n5\nNC\n(Q −NCL) −2\n3\n˜Y\n(1)\nwith the properly integer quantized hypercharge ˜Y . See Table I.\n• The Z4,X has the advantage that all SM fermions have Z4,X charge 1, thus we can consider the 4-body\nBSM multi-fermion Z4,X-preserving deformations\nψqψqψqψl,\nψ¯qψqψ¯lψl,\nψ¯qψqψ¯qψq,\nψ¯lψlψ¯lψl.\n(2)\nbecause their Z4,X charge is 4 = 0 mod 4.\n• The Z8,X is less uniform so SM quarks and leptons carry different Z8,X charges. In addition to 4-body\nmulti-fermion, one can consider 8-body multi-fermion deformations\n(ψ¯qψqψ¯qψq)(ψ¯qψqψ¯qψq),\n(ψ¯lψlψ¯lψl)(ψ¯lψlψ¯lψl),\n(ψ¯qψqψ¯qψq)(ψ¯lψlψ¯lψl),\n. . .\n(3)\nso that their Z8,X charge is 0 mod 8.\nCrucially, without any of those BSM deformations at the electroweak SM energy scale, the B −L or X is\npreserved as a full U(1) symmetry.\n2. The discreteness of B + L is constrained by the family number Nf, as faithful Z2Nf ,B+L or an unfaithful\nZ2NcNf ,Q+NcL symmetry for the SM, for Nc = 3. We will vary the family or generation number Nf = 1, 2, 3, 4,\netc. to explore the uniqueness of Nf = 3.\nUnlike the free quadratic Majorana mass gap of νR preserving only the minimal fermion parity ZF\n2 (see Fig. 1\n(a) and (b)), the exotic ZF\n2N-preserving new scenarios can contain highly interacting symmetric anomalous gapped\ntopological orders (which inspiration originates from quantum condensed matter phenomena [31, 32]) or symmetric\nanomalous gapless sectors such as conformal field theories, see Fig. 1 (c). These anomalous topological orders may\nor may not have topological quantum field theory (TQFT) descriptions at low energy [33, 34]. The enumerations of\npossible anomaly cancellation scenarios are summarized in Fig. 2.\nWe propose introducing these symmetric anomalous sectors as quantum dark matter to cancel the SM’s discrete\ngauge-gravitational global anomaly involving the discrete B ± L. We identify some of the mathematical constraints\nof the topologically ordered quantum dark matter. The implications beyond the SM include:\n1. The existence of the 5th force as the topological gauge force of discrete B ± L gauge fields mediating between\nthe SM and the dark matter.\n2. The dark matter can partly contain topological quantum matter, such that the topologically ordered gapped\nexcitations at the open ends of extended line and surface defects can have anyon statistics,\n3. Ultra Unification [4–6] and topological leptogenesis [10].\n2 See the recent modern systematic studies of nonperturbative global anomalies in the context of the Standard Model in Refs. [17–20].\nFor our terminology, we mean that:\n• Perturbative local anomalies (e.g. [2, 3]) are detected by small (i.e. local) continuous symmetry transformation connected to the\nidentity transformation, hence it is sometimes called the continuous anomaly.\n• Non-perturbative global anomalies (e.g. [21–23]) are detected by large (i.e. global) discrete symmetry transformation disconnected\nfrom the identity transformation, hence it is sometimes called the discrete anomaly.\n• Sometimes the discrete anomaly is also used differently to describe the anomaly associated with discrete symmetries. See pioneer\nwork in [24–26]. In our case, we do have both the discrete global anomaly in both senses of (1) nonperturbative global anomalies, and\n(2) discrete B ± L symmetries.\n• ’t Hooft anomalies are referred to the anomaly of the global symmetry (that cannot be consistently dynamically gauged).\n• Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies are the violations of the global symmetry in the presence of some (other) dynamically gauge fields.\n• Dynamical gauge anomalies are meant to be canceled with dynamical gauge fields, for the consistency under the name of anomaly\ncancellation.\n• Gauge or gravitational anomalies are anomalies associated with gauge or gravitational fields, that can be either background fields or\ndynamical fields. Bosonic or fermionic anomalies are anomalies associated with the anomalous boundary of one-higher dimensional bulk\nbosonic or fermionic Symmetry-Protected Topological states (SPTs).\n3 The ZF\n2 is generated by (−1)F with the fermion number F, so that ((−1)F)2 = +1.\nThe ZF\n2N ⊃ZF\n2 contains the fermion parity as a normal subgroup such that the quotient group ZF\n2N/ZF\n2 = ZN.\nFor Z2N,X as ZF\n2N, we have the generator X2N = +1 as the cyclic group of order 2N.\n\n\n4\nFIG. 1. Here we give a specific example for Z16 class global anomaly cancellation for the mixed Z4,X-gravity anomalies between\nthe SM and the BSM dark matter sector, known for the model of Ultra Unification [4–8]. Similar generalization for B ± L\nsymmetry can be analogously obtained, too.\n(a) A single Weyl fermion with a unit charge 1 ∈Z4,X can cancel an anomaly index ν = 1 ∈Z16. A single Weyl fermion can\nlive on the boundary of 5d Z16 class Z4,X-symmetric topological superconductor or SPTs in condensed matter, or known as\nAtiyah-Patodi-Singer eta invariant or invertible topological field theory (iTFT) cobordism invariant [17, 18, 20]. This can be\nthe 16th Weyl fermion, the sterile right-handed neutrinos (denoted ¯νR so to be left-handed), shown in cartoon.\n(b) A single Weyl fermion is equivalent to a Majorana fermion in 4d, which can obtain a Majorana mass gap, but that Majorana\nmass term breaks Z4,X down to the minimal fermion parity ZF\n2 .\n(c) The last scenario is inspired by the quantum condensed matter phenomena called the 2+1d symmetric anomalous boundary\ntopological order on the boundary of 3+1d SPTs [31, 32]. Here we consider its one higher-dimensional generalization: the 3+1d\nsymmetric anomalous boundary topological order on the boundary of 4+1d SPTs. There are gapped extended line or surfaces\ndefects in the 3+1d topological order. The open ends of extended defects that carry anyon statistics. The last scenario could\nalso include symmetric anomalous gapless sectors such as conformal field theories.\nFIG. 2. The anomaly cancellation demands the total summation of the anomaly index ν = 0. For perturbative local anomaly\nclassified by an integer Z class, the ν = 0 is strict. But for nonperturbative global anomaly classified by an integer Zn class,\nonly the ν = 0 mod n is required. In addition to the familiar scenario of adding fermions (either gapless or gapped) to cancel\nthe anomaly (marked in green), there are also novel scenarios (marked in pink) include adding interacting symmetric gapped\ntopological order (TO) with or without low-energy topological quantum field theory (TQFT) desciption, or symmetric gapless\nconformal field theory (CFT), or an extra-dimensional bulk of invertible field theory. When the anomaly index is ν = 0 mod n,\none can also use the Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG, e.g. see a review [35]) mechanism to move between different quantum\nphases.\nBelow we will mainly use the constraints obtained in [37, 38] or in 3+1d boundary topological order of 4+1d SPTs\nobtained in [33, 34] to comment about the hypothetical gapped or gapless topological quantum matter phases as dark\nmatter sectors.\n\n\n5\nFIG. 3. A schematic picture on the nonperturbative global anomaly cancellation: how the quantum field theory (QFT) of the\nStandard Model (SM) can be coupled to the topological quantum field theory (TQFT) or conformal field theory (CFT) and\nothers, via discrete gauge fields. Shown here Ref. [4–6] considers discrete X or B −L gauge field. But more generally, for the\nSM, this works consider discrete B±L gauge fields. This is a specific QFT coupling to a TQFT scenario, see more explorations\non this topic in [36].\nII.\nDISCRETE B + L GLOBAL ANOMALY AND DARK MATTER SECTOR\nBased on the calculation done in Appendix A, we find the following results. (Since these anomalies listed below\nvanish for the 16-Weyl fermion SM, so we will only discuss the implications on the 15-Weyl fermion SM.)\nFor Z2Nf ,B+L (faithful for free quarks), at Nc = 3 color,\n1. Nf = 1, there is no global anomaly for 15-Weyl fermion SM.\n2. Nf = 2, the anomaly index of the Nf = 2-family SM (without 2 ¯νR) is (2 mod 16). According to [34],\n• The (2 mod 16) corresponds to the 4d anomaly of beyond the group cohomology 5d SPT.\n• For ν = N = 2 or even ∈Z16, we have a symmetric gapped Z4 gauge theory TQFT.\n• For ν = N/2 = 1 or odd\n∈Z16, we find a non-TQFT symmetric gapped state via stacking lower-\ndimensional (2+1)d non-discrete-gauge-theory topological order (that has TQFT descriptions) inhomo-\ngeneously.\n3. Nf = 3, the anomaly index of the Nf = 3-family SM (without 3 ¯νR) is (3 mod 9). The (3 mod 9) corresponds\nto the 4d anomaly of the group cohomology 5d SPT, see Appendix B.\nFor Z2NcNf ,Q+NcL (unfaithful for baryons, but faithful for free quarks or the ungauged SM without gauging the\n[SU(3)] color), at Nc = 3 color,\n1. Nf = 1, the anomaly index is 0 mod 9 Thus, there is no needed to trivialize by ZNc=3-extension via the\nconstruction in [39].\n2. Nf = 2, the anomaly index of the 2-family SM (without 2 ¯νR) is (−2 mod 16,\n0 mod 9), thus anomalous.\nThe ZNc=3-extension via the construction in [39] cannot trivialize this anomaly.\n3. Nf = 3, the anomaly index of the Nf = 3-family SM (without 3 ¯νR) is (0 mod 27,\n0 mod 3).\n\n\n6\n• This shows the uniqueness of Nf = 3 or a multiple of 3 such that the following group extension\n1 →ZNc=3 →ZNcNf =9 →ZNf =3 →1,\n(4)\ncan trivialize the previous (3 mod 9) anomaly for Z2Nf =6,B+L. Thus this also means that such a symmetry-\nextension can help to construct the symmetric gapped boundary topological order via the construction in\n[39]. See more discussions on the uniqueness of the Z3 symmetry in Appendix B.\n• Note that this Nf = 3 family argument is different from the dimensional reduction argument via c−= 24\nmodular invariant in 2d CFT or framing anomaly free in 3d TQFT, and pure gravitational anomaly\nvanishing argument given in [40].\n• Note that our Z3 symmetry assignment here only relies on the B + L symmetry of the standard SM, thus\ncrucially very different from the minimal-supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) previously discussed\nin [17, 41].\n• There are other physical motivations to consider the Z2NcNf =18,Q+NcL as a global or gauge symmetry in\nproton stability [8, 42] or in cosmological lithium problem [43].\nIII.\nDISCRETE B −L GLOBAL ANOMALY AND DARK MATTER SECTOR\nWe consider Z2N,X symmetry for the discrete B −L symmetry,\n1. Z4,X: The anomaly index of the 3-family SM (without 3 ¯νR) is (−3 mod 16). Using a ν = even ∈Z16 index\nsymmetric gapped Z4 gauge theory TQFT [34] is not enough to cancel the SM’s Nf = 3 anomaly, either some\nνR, or some 4d gapless vector, or some extra dimensional 5d bulk, or some non-TQFT kind of fracton topological\norder is needed.\n2. Z8,X: Missing 3 right-handed neutrinos (not found in the SM), each has Z8,X charge q = 5, thus the 3 right-\nhanded neutrinos has 3(−7 mod 32,\n1 mod 2) = (11 mod 32,\n1 mod 2). The complementary anomaly\nindex of the SM is (21 mod 32,\n1 mod 2). Using a ν = 4k ∈Z32 index symmetric gapped Z4 gauge theory\nTQFT [34] is not enough to cancel the SM’s Nf = 3 anomaly, either some νR, or some 4d gapless vector, or\nsome extra dimensional 5d bulk, or some non-TQFT kind of fracton topological order is needed.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nJW thanks Meng Cheng, Pavel Putrov, Zheyan Wan, Matthew Yu, and Yunqin Zheng for helpful discussions.

We will follow the discussion in the Appendix of [9]. We will also require information from [18]. We will\nrecombine the linear combination of the generators of the 3+1d anomaly (or 4+1d cobordism invariant) in [18] to\nderive the appropriate generator that can match with that of a charge q Weyl fermion.\nBelow we may simply denote the 3+1d spacetime as 4d, and 4+1d spacetime as 5d.\n1.\nAnomaly Polynomial\nWe read the 4d Weyl fermion anomaly and its associated 5d invertible theory action S5 = 2π\nR\nM 5 I5 ∈2πR from\nthe 6d anomaly polynomial I6 = dI5 whose integration over a closed 6-manifold is valued in Z, from the ˆA genus and\nthe Chern character ch(E),\nˆA ch(E),\n(A1)\n\n\n7\nwhere ˆA and ch(E) are given as:\nˆA = 1 −p1\n24 + 7p2\n1 −4p2\n5760\n+ . . . ,\n(A2)\nch(E) = rank E + c1(E) + 1\n2\n\u0000c2\n1(E) −2c2(E)\n\u0001\n+ 1\n6\n\u0000c3\n1(E) −3c1(E)c2(E) + 3c3(E)\n\u0001\n+ . . .\n(A3)\nFor a single left-handed Weyl fermion of charge q, we take E to be the complex line bundle associated with the\ncorresponding representation of U(1). Hence, the fermionic 6d anomaly polynomial is integer quantized over a closed\n6-manifold\nZ\nM 6 I6,f =\nZ\nM 6[ˆA ch(E)]6 =\nZ\nM 6 q3 c3\n1\n6 −q c1p1\n24\n∈Z,\n(A4)\ncomputed as the index of the 6d Dirac operator via Atiyah-Singer index theorem [2, 3]. The 5d invertible theory\naction is\nS5 = 2π\nZ\nM 5 I5 =\nZ\nM 6 q3Ac2\n1\n6 −qAp1\n24 ∈2πR.\n(A5)\nNext, we will start with two compatible Spin × U(1) and Spin ×ZF\n2 U(1) ≡Spinc structures for the fermion case\nwith a U(1) symmetry, to match with the appropriate generators of the cobordism group Hom(ΩSpinc\n6\n, Z) = Z2 and\nHom(ΩSpin×U(1)\n6\n, Z) = Z2. Then we consider the Weyl fermion with a charge q of a discrete subgroup Zn symmetry\nout of this U(1).\n2.\nSpin × U(1) symmetry\nAssuming that ZF\n2 ̸⊂U(1), which means the spacetime-internal symmetry group structure is Spin × U(1) structure,\nthe 6d anomaly polynomial I6 above is in general a linear combination (over Z, if the charge q is an integer) of the\nfollowing two terms:\nIA := c3\n1\n6 −c1p1\n24\n∈Z,\nIB := c3\n1 ∈Z.\n(A6)\nFor a general charge q left-handed Weyl fermion, we have:\nI6 = qIA + q3 −q\n6\nIB ∈Z.\n(A7)\nIA and IB serve as the two generators of Hom(ΩSpin\n6\n(BU(1)), Z) ∼= Z×Z by considering their integrals over 6-manifolds\nrepresenting the elements in the bordism group. The integer values follow the Atiyah-Singer index theorem for the\nDirac operator. Note that (q3 −q)/6 ∈Z for any q ∈Z. Instead of (IA, IB) as above, we can consider another pair\nrelated to it by a GL(2, Z) transformation.\n3.\nSpin ×ZF\n2 U(1)F = Spinc symmetry\nAssuming ZF\n2 ⊂U(1), which means the spacetime-internal symmetry structure is Spin ×ZF\n2 U(1) ≡Spinc structure\n(so that in particular q is necessarily odd for fermions), the general 6d anomaly polynomial is an integral linear\ncombination of the following two terms:\nIC := c3\n1\n6 −c1p1\n24\n= (2c1)3 −(2c1)p1\n48\n∈Z,\nID := 4c3\n1 = (2c1)3\n2\n∈Z.\n(A8)\nFor a general charge q left-handed Weyl fermion, we have:\nI6 = qIC + q3 −q\n24\nID ∈Z.\n(A9)\n\n\n8\nIC and ID serve as the two generators of Hom(ΩSpinc\n6\n, Z) ∼= Z × Z, whose integer values following the Atiyah-Singer\nindex theorem for the Dirac operator.\nNote that in this Spinc case, c1 is in general not a well-defined integer cohomology class, only 2c1 is.

Then we can solve\nιC, ιD ∈Z16 by plugging the constraint of the anomaly index ν(q) ∈Z16 with an odd q = 1, 3 ∈Z4; we have\nν(q) = qιC + q3 −q\n24\nιD\nmod 16.\nν(q = 1) = 1 = 1ιC + 0ιD\nmod 16.\nν(q = 3) = −1 = 3ιC + 1ιD\nmod 16.\n⇒ιC = 1\nmod 16,\nιD = −4\nmod 16.\n(A10)\nFinally, for an odd charge q ∈Z4 Weyl fermion, we obtain its anomaly index formula\nν(q) = qιC + q3 −q\n24\nιD = q −4q3 −q\n24\n= −q3 + 7q\n6\nmod 16 ∈Z16.\n(A11)\nUsing the theory in [34], we find that the Z16 class of 5d ZF\n4 fSPTs and C2 × ZF\n2 fSPTs has:\n• For ν = N = 2 or even ∈Z16, we have a symmetric gapped Z4 gauge theory TQFT.\n• For ν = N/2 = 1 or odd ∈Z16, we find a non-TQFT symmetric gapped state via stacking lower-dimensional\n(2+1)d non-discrete-gauge-theory topological order (that has TQFT descriptions) inhomogeneously.\nThere are two applications for ZF\n4 symmetry:\n1. First application: The Z4,X symmetry as ZF\n4 . There are 3 missing right-handed neutrinos not found in the\nStandard Model, each of such ¯νR has ZF\n4 charge 1, thus for 3 families of such ¯νR, we have the total anomaly\nindex\n3(1\nmod 16) = (3\nmod 16).\n(A12)\n4 For Spinc, the U(1) ⊃ZF\n2 contains the fermion parity as a normal subgroup.\n• For the original U(1) with c1(U(1)), the gauge bundle constraint is w2(TM) = 2c1 mod 2. In the original U(1), fermions have odd\ncharges under U(1), while bosons have even charges under U(1). Call the original U(1) gauge field A, then c1 = dA\n2π ∈1\n2 Z.\n• For the new U(1)′ = U(1)\nZF\n2\nwith c1(U(1)′), the gauge bundle constraint is w2(TM) = c′\n1 = 2c1 mod 2. Call the new U(1)′ gauge field\nA′, then c′\n1 = dA′\n2π = d(2A)\n2π\n= 2c1 ∈2 1\n2 Z = Z.\n• To explain why A′ = 2A or c′\n1 = 2c1, we look at the Wilson line operator exp(iq′ H\nA′) and exp(iq\nH\nA). The original U(1) has\ncharge transformation exp(iqθ) with θ ∈[0, 2π), while the new U(1)′ has charge transformation exp(iq′θ′) with θ′ ∈[0, 2π). But the\nU(1)′ = U(1)\nZF\n2 , so the θ = π in the old U(1) is identified as θ′ = 2π as a trivial zero in the new U(1)′. In the original U(1), the q ∈Z to\nbe compatible with θ ∈[0, 2π). In the new U(1)′, the original q is still allowed to have 2Z to be compatible with θ ∈[0, π); but the new\nq′ = 1\n2 q ∈Z and the new θ′ = 2θ ∈[0, 2π) are scaled accordingly. Since the new q′ = 1\n2 q ∈Z, we show the new A′ = 2A.\n\n\n9\nThe complementary anomaly index of the 3-family SM (without 3 ¯νR) is\n(−3\nmod 16).\n(A13)\nUsing a ν = even ∈Z16 index symmetric gapped Z4 gauge theory TQFT [34] is not enough to cancel the\nSM’s Nf = 3 anomaly, either some νR, or some 4d gapless vector, or some extra dimensional 5d bulk, or some\nnon-TQFT kind of fracton topological order is needed.\n2.

[18] anomaly index formula (2.31), we are able to derive an appropriate linear combination of two\ngenerators in (2.31) to give rise to\n(ν1(q = 3), ν2(q = 3)) = (0\nmod 27,\n2\nmod 3).\nν2(q = 3) = 2 = 3ιA\n2 + 4ιB\n2\nmod 3.\n⇒ιA\n2 = 0\nmod 3,\nιB\n2 = 2\nmod 3.\n(A46)\nThus for a charge q ∈Z9 Weyl fermion, we obtain its anomaly index formula\n(ν1(q), ν2(q)) ∈Z27 × Z3\n= (qιA\n1 + q3 −q\n6\nιB\n1\nmod 27, qιA\n2 + q3 −q\n6\nιB\n2\nmod 3)\n= (q3\nmod 27, q3 −q\n3\nmod 3).\n(A47)\nFor a charge q ∈Z9 Weyl fermion, we have a map to the anomaly index\nq = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 7→(ν1, ν2) = (1, 0), (8, 2), (0, 2), (10, 2), (17, 1), (0, 1), (19, 1), (26, 0).\n(A48)\nThere are 3 missing right-handed neutrinos not found in the Standard Model, each such ¯νR has ZF\n2NcNf =18 charge\n−3 = 15, each has Z9 charge 6,7 thus for 3 families of such ¯νR, we have\n3(0\nmod 27,\n1\nmod 3) = (0\nmod 27,\n0\nmod 3).\n(A49)\n7 We can label n18 ∈Z18 = ZF\n18 ⊃ZF\n2 in terms of a doublet (nF\n2 , n9) ∈ZF\n2 × Z9, such that the bosons have nF\n2 = 0 and the fermions have\nnF\n2 = 1. In addition, without loss of generality, we assign the charge q = 1 ∈ZF\n18 fermion to the (nF\n2 , n9) = (1, 1) ∈ZF\n2 × Z9. These are\nenough to constrain the map in between as n18 = 9nF\n2 −8n9. Thus, n18 = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 is mapped\nto (nF\n2 , n9) = (0, 0), (1, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (0, 4), (1, 5), (0, 6), (1, 7), (0, 8), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (0, 5), (1, 6), (0, 7), (1, 8).\n\n\n15\nThe complementary anomaly index of the 3-family SM (without 3 ¯νR) is\n(0\nmod 27,\n0\nmod 3),\n(A50)\nthus anomaly-free.\n10.\nSpin ×ZF\n2 ZF\n18 symmetry\nConsider Spin ×ZF\n2 ZF\n18 symmetry (⊂Spinc symmetry), for an odd charge q ∈Z18F Weyl fermion theory in 4d,\nwe like to match its 4d anomaly to a 5d bordism group index Ω\nSpin×ZF\n2 ZF\n18\n5\n= ΩSpin×Z9\n5\n= Z27 × Z3 or precisely a 5d\ncobordism group index Hom(Ω\nSpin×ZF\n2 Z18\n5\n, U(1)) = Hom(ΩSpin×Z9\n5\n, U(1)) = Z27 × Z3.\nTo derive the anomaly index formula (ν1(q), ν2(q)) ∈Z27 × Z3, we follow the previous arguments with similar\nconstraints.\nFor an odd charge q ∈Z18 Weyl fermion, We arrive at the map to the anomaly index\nq = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17\n7→(ν1, ν2) = (1, 0), (0, 2), (17, 1), (19, 1), (0, 0), (8, 2), (10, 2), (0, 1), (26, 0).\n(A51)\nThere are 3 missing right-handed neutrinos not found in the Standard Model, each such ¯νR has ZF\n2NcNf =18 charge\n−3 = 15, thus for 3 families of such ¯νR, we have\n3(0\nmod 27,\n1\nmod 3) = (0\nmod 27,\n0\nmod 3).\n(A52)\nThere is an ambiguity of the first mod 27 index, where the ambiguity comes 9k mod 27 for k ∈Z thus at 0 mod 9;\nbut the outcome choice would not affect our Nf = 3 anomaly, because 9Nf = 27 = 0 mod 27. The complementary\nanomaly index of the 3-family SM (without 3 ¯νR) is\n(0\nmod 27,\n0\nmod 3),\n(A53)\nthus anomaly-free.\nAppendix B: Z9 class topological invariants of Spin × Z3 and the group extension 1 →Z3 →Z9 →Z3 →1\nHere we demonstrate the bordism ΩSpin×Z3\n5\n= Z9 or the cobordism Hom(ΩSpin×Z3\n5\n, U(1)) = Z9 class topological\ninvariants of Spin × Z3 symmetry; such that the magical Z9 class forms a group extension:\n1 →Z3 →Z9 →Z3 →1,\n(B1)\nor more schematically\n1 →(Z3)group cohomology →(Z9)full cobordism class →(Z3)beyond group cohomology →1.\n(B2)\nThe normal Z3 is from the group cohomology bosonic SPT class in H5(BZ3, U(1)) = Z3 tensor product with the free\nfermion SPT class. The quotient Z9/Z3 = Z3 is from the beyond group cohomology SPT class.\nTo demonstrate the above statement, we shall embed Spin × Z3 ⊂Spin × U(1) first, then change the U(1) gauge\nfield to a Z3 gauge field.\nWe take the Spin × U(1) structure’s 6d anomaly polynomial I6 above in eq. (A6) with q = 1 Weyl fermion gives\nthe following 6d anomaly polynomial’s invertible field theory\nexp(ikθ\nZ\nM 6\nc3\n1\n6 −c1p1\n24 )\n(B3)\nwith k ∈Z, while θ ∈[0, 2π), and\nR\nM 6\nc3\n1\n6 −c1p1\n24\n∈Z on a closed M 6 of the given structure. The 5d manifold at the\ninterface of jumping θ = 0 to θ = 2π gives a 5d invertible field theory (as a 5d SPTs):\nexp(ik\nZ\nM 5 Ac2\n1\n6 −Ap1\n24).\n(B4)\n\n\n16\nNow we redefine the U(1) gauge field A as a Z3 gauge field ˜A ∈Z3 with the following replacement:\nA 7→2π\n3\n˜A.\nc1 = dA\n2π\n7→d ˜A\n3\n≡β(3,3) ˜A.\n(B5)\nThe β(n,m) : H∗(−, Zm) 7→H∗+1(−, Zn) is the Bockstein homomorphism associated with the extension Zn\n·m\n→Znm →\nZm. Thus we get the 5d topological invariant of the Spin × Z3 as:\nexp\n\u0000i2πk\nZ\nM 5( 1\n18\n˜A(β(3,3) ˜A)(β(3,3) ˜A) −\n1\n3 · 24\n˜Ap1)\n\u0001\n.\n(B6)\nNow when k = 3, we get\nexp\n\u0000i2π\nZ\nM 5(1\n6\n˜A(β(3,3) ˜A)(β(3,3) ˜A) −1\n24\n˜Ap1)\n\u0001\n= exp\n\u0000i2π\nZ\nM 5(1\n6\n˜A(β(3,3) ˜A)(β(3,3) ˜A))\n\u0001\n,\n(B7)\nwhile the equality relies on a Theorem of Tomonaga [52] such that\nR\nM 5 ˜Ap1 = 0 mod 24 on the Spin × Z3 manifold.\nNext, we show that this k = 3 class indeed is the generator of the group cohomology bosonic SPT class in\nH5(BZ3, U(1)) = Z3 tensor product with the free fermion SPT class, such that the 3 layers of eq. (B7) becomes a\ntrivial class. Namely, when k = 3 · 3 = 9, we get\nexp\n\u0000iπ\nZ\nM 5\n˜A(β(3,3) ˜A)(β(3,3) ˜A)\n\u0001\n= exp\n\u0000iπ\nZ\nM 5\n˜A(4β(3,3) ˜A)(β(3,3) ˜A)\n\u0001\n= 1,\n(B8)\nwhich can only read the 0, 1 mod 2 in\nR\nM 5( ˜A(β(3,3) ˜A)(β(3,3) ˜A) mod 2. Now, we use the conflict between the mod 2\nindex built out of the mod 3 gauge field to argue that this is a trivial class of SPTs. Note that 3(β(3,3) ˜A) = 0 mod 3\nand (β(3,3) ˜A) = 4(β(3,3) ˜A) =\nmod 3 used in the first equality for the Z3 valued gauge field, while the second equality\nuses 2(2πZ) = 0 mod 2π thus eq. (B8) is a trivial class SPTs.\nWe may simply consider k = 3 case as exp\n\u0000i2π\nR\nM 5( 1\n3 ˜A(β(3,3) ˜A)(β(3,3) ˜A))\n\u0001\ntensor product with a trivial gapped\nfermionic state. Then the k = 9 also generates a +1 as a trivial SPTs, This concludes the proof of the group extension\nin eq. (B2) as the Z9 classification of 5d Spin × Z3 topological invariants thus also 5d fermionic SPTs.\n\n\n17\n[1] Tohru Eguchi and Peter G. O. Freund, “Quantum Gravity and World Topology,” Phys. Rev.

    "abstract": "Standard Model (SM) with 15 Weyl fermions per family (lacking the 16th, the\nsterile right-handed neutrino $\\nu_R$) suffers from mixed gauge-gravitational\nanomalies tied to baryon number plus or minus lepton number ${\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf\nL}$ symmetry. Including $\\nu_R$ per family can cancel these anomalies, but when\n${\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf L}$ symmetry is preserved as discrete finite subgroups rather\nthan a continuous U(1), the perturbative local anomalies become nonperturbative\nglobal anomalies. In this work, we systematically enumerate these\ngauge-gravitational global anomalies involving discrete ${\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf L}$\nthat are enhanced from the fermion parity $\\mathbb{Z}_2^{\\rm F}$ to\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\\rm F}$, with $N=2,3,4,6,9$, etc. The ${\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf L}$\ndiscreteness is constrained by multi-fermion deformations beyond-the-SM and the\nfamily number $N_f$. Unlike the free quadratic $\\nu_R$ Majorana mass gap\npreserving the minimal $\\mathbb{Z}_2^{\\rm F}$, we explore novel scenarios\ncanceling $({\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf L})$-gravitational anomalies while preserving the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\\rm F}$ discrete symmetries, featuring 4d interacting gapped\ntopological orders (potentially with or without low-energy TQFT descriptions)\nor gapless sectors (e.g., conformal field theories). We propose anomalous\nsectors as quantum dark matter to cancel SM's global anomalies. We find the\n$N_f=3$ uniqueness, when the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\\rm F}$ representation from the\nfaithful ${\\bf B} + {\\bf L}$ for baryons at $N=N_c=3$ is extended to the\nfaithful ${\\bf Q} + N_c {\\bf L}$ for quarks at $N=N_c N_f=9$, this symmetry\nextension matches with the topological order dark matter construction. Key\nimplications include: (1) a 5th force mediating between SM and dark matter via\ndiscrete gauge fields. (2) dark matter as topological order quantum matter with\ngapped anyon excitations at ends of extended defects. (3) topological\nleptogenesis.",
