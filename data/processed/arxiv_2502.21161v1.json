The phenomenological\nΛN CSB interaction is introduced and the strength parameter is fitted to reproduce the experimental binding energy\ndifference between the mirror hypernuclei 12\nΛ B and 12\nΛ C. This model is applied to calculate the CSB energy anomaly in\nmirror hypernuclei with the mass A = 7 ∼48. The model is further applied to predict the binding energy difference\nof mirror hypernuclei of A=40 with the isospin T = 1/2, 3/2 and 5/2 nuclei together with various hyper Ca isotopes\nand their mirror hypernuclei. Finally the binding energy systematics of A =48 hypernuclei are predicted with/without\nthe CSB effect by the PK1 and TM2 energy density functionals (EDFs).\nKeywords: charge symmetry breaking, single-Λ hypernuclei, RMF model\n1. Introduction\nIn hypernuclear physics, it is important to extract in-\nformation on hyperon (Y)-nucleon(N) interaction. His-\ntorically, due to the difficulties of YN scattering exper-\niments, we have been obtaining information on YN in-\nteraction by the studies of hypernuclear structures. For\nthis purpose, in the case of the ΛN sector, high resolu-\ntion γ-ray experiments have been performed in light Λ\nhypernuclei systematically [1].\nTheoretically, several shell-model calculations for\nlight Λ hypernuclei have been performed [2, 3]. Fur-\nthermore, microscopic calculations of three- and four-\ncluster system with sufficient numerical accuracy have\nbeen performed [4, 5, 6]. With these theoretical calcu-\nlations and experimental data, we have obtained spin-\ndependent forces of ΛN interaction such as spin-spin\nterm, spin-orbit term, and etc.\nHowever, there is still an open important issue to be\nsolved, i.e., charge symmetry breaking (CSB) compo-\nnent in the ΛN interaction. Historically, evidence for\nthe CSB interaction has been observed in the single-Λ\n∗Corresponding author.\nEmail addresses: hiroyuki.sagawa@gmail.com (Hiroyuki\nSagawa), hiyama@riken.jp (Emiko Hiyama)\nbinding energies BΛ of the A = 4 mirror hypernuclei\n4\nΛH and 4\nΛHe. This evidence is attributed to the energy\ndifference ∆BΛ ≡BΛ(4\nΛH) −BΛ(4\nΛHe), which was mea-\nsured to be −0.35 ± 0.06 MeV for the ground (0+) state\nand −0.24±0.06 MeV for the excited (1+) state, respec-\ntively [7]. To reproduce the observed data, many theo-\nretical efforts have been done. To understand the CSB\neffect, Dalitz and Von Hippel [8] pointed out that the Λ-\nΣ0 mixing mechanism, which is related to ΛN-ΣN cou-\npling, is important. Thereafter, several calculations tak-\ning account of ΛN-ΣN coupling have been performed\nfor the A = 4 hypernuclei [9, 10, 11, 12]. However, it\nwas difficult to reproduce the experimental data.\nIn 2015, the ground state of 4\nΛH has been observed\nwith high accuracy at MAMI-C [13], and the obtained\nsingle-Λ separation energy BΛ = 2.21 ± 0.01 (stat) ±\n0.09 (syst) MeV, which is consistent with the emulsion\nvalue [7]. Moreover, the γ-ray transition from the 1+\nexcited state to the 0+ ground state in 4\nΛHe has been ob-\nserved at J-PARC and the obtained excitation energy is\n1.406±0.002 (stat)±0.002 (syst) MeV [14], which was\nquite different with the old data. After these two obser-\nvations, many works have discussed the CSB effect on\nthe A = 4 light systems [15, 16, 17]. Still, it is difficult\nto reproduce the new data.\nMore information on CSB effect are required. For\nPreprint submitted to Physics Letters B\nMarch 3, 2025\narXiv:2502.21161v1  [nucl-th]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\nthis purpose, one can also focus on the study of heav-\nier Λ hypernuclei with mass number A = 7, 10 and\nlarger. For the A = 7 single-Λ hypernuclei, the bind-\ning energies of 7\nΛHe, 7\nΛLi, and 7\nΛBe with isospin T =\n1, have been observed experimentally. Among these\ndata, the binding energy BΛ in 7\nΛHe has been observed\nto be 5.68 ± 0.03 (stat) ± 0.25 (syst) MeV by the\n7Li(e, e′K+)7\nΛHe reaction at JLab [18]. Later, the ob-\nserved binding energy of 7\nΛHe has been updated to be\n5.55 ± 0.10 (stat) ± 0.11 (syst) MeV with a better sys-\ntematic error [19]. In the case of 7\nΛBe, there were old\nemulsion data giving BΛ = 5.16 MeV [7]. As a result,\nthe energy difference, ∆BΛ ≡BΛ(7\nΛHe) −BΛ(7\nΛBe), be-\ntween 7\nΛHe and 7\nΛBe is 0.39 MeV, which exhibits a larger\nenergy difference compared to that of A = 4 hypernu-\nclei.\nRegarding the A = 10 mirror hypernuclei, there was\none old emulsion data for 10\nΛ Be which gives BΛ = 9.11±\n0.22 MeV [7, 20]. In 2016, high-resolution experiment\nhas been done at JLab using the (e, e′K+) reaction and\nreported the observed binding energy BΛ of 10\nΛ Be to be\n8.60±0.07 (stat)±0.11 (syst) MeV [21]. Meanwhile, the\nBΛ for 10\nΛ B is 8.89 ± 0.12 (stat) ± 0.04 (syst) MeV mea-\nsured in emulsion [22] while 8.1±0.1 MeV measured by\nthe (π+, K+) reaction at KEK [23], which was corrected\nto be BΛ = 8.64 ± 0.1 MeV in Ref. [21]. Thus, based on\nthose experimental data, there are two suggested pos-\nsible binding energy differences ∆BΛ ≡BΛ(10\nΛ Be) −\nBΛ(10\nΛ B) between the A = 10 mirror hypernuclei. One\nvalue is ∆BΛ = 9.11−8.89 = 0.22 MeV, while the other\nis 8.60 −8.64 = −0.04 MeV. For more heavier Λ hyper-\nnuclei, we have data for the A = 12 mirror hypernuclei\n12\nΛ B and 12\nΛ C, and the observed BΛs are 11.529 ± 0.025\nMeV [24] and 11.30 ± 0.19 MeV [21, 22, 25], respec-\ntively1. Therefore, the experimental value of ∆BΛ ≡\nBΛ(12\nΛ B) −BΛ(12\nΛ C) is 0.229 MeV, although the error bar\nin 12\nΛ C is still large. A comprehensive summary of BΛ\nvalues for Λ-hypernuclei with A ≤16 has been provided\nin Ref. [27].\nIt is noted that in mirror hypernuclei, the binding en-\nergies BΛs on the neutron-rich side are larger compared\nto those on the proton-rich side for p-shell Λ hypernu-\nclei. In contrast, the behavior of s-shell Λ hypernuclei\nis opposite to that of p-shell Λ hypernuclei. In order\nto reproduce both the s-shell and p-shell hypernuclear\ndata, in Ref. [6], one of the present authors, E.H., in-\ntroduced a phenomenological odd-state CSB interaction\nwhich has an opposite sign to the even-state CSB inter-\n1According to Mainz compilation [26], the data is 11.335 ± 0.126\nMeV, which is similar with Ref. [21]. It should be noted that Ref.\n[24] provides high statics. Thus, we cite Ref. [21].\naction to reproduce the observed data of 4\nΛH and 4\nΛHe.\nThe odd-state CSB interaction was adjusted so as to re-\nproduce the observed BΛs of T = 1 isotriplet hypernu-\nclei 7\nΛHe, 7\nΛLi, and 7\nΛBe. The CSB interaction was also\napplied to calculate the binding energies of the A = 10\nmirror hypernuclei, 10\nΛ B and 10\nΛ Be, and the obtained ∆BΛ\nwas consistent with the data, provided that the odd-state\nCSB interaction has an opposite sign to that of the even-\nstate CSB interaction.\nTo further study CSB effect, we need information on\nheavier Λ hypernuclei. For this purpose, it is planned\nat JLab to produce 40\nΛ K and 48\nΛ K via (e, e′K+) reactions\nusing 40Ca and 48Ca targets. In this paper, based on\nthe relativistic mean field (RMF) model, we discuss the\nCSB effect on the single-Λ hypernuclei with mass num-\nbers ranging from A = 7 to 48 and also predict the pos-\nsibility to observe the CSB effect at JLab and J-PARC.\nIn Section 2, the theoretical framework is given. The\ncalculated results and discussions are presented in Sec-\ntion 3 and the summary is drawn in Section 4.\n2. Theoretical framework\n2.1. RMF model for Λ hypernuclei\nRMF models have achieved great successes in the de-\nscriptions of ordinary nuclei [28], hypernuclei [29, 30,\n31, 32, 33] as well as baryon matter [34, 35]. The start-\ning point of the meson-exchange RMF model for the Λ\nhypernuclei is the following covariant Lagrangian den-\nsity,\nL = LN + LΛ.\n(1)\nHere LN is the standard RMF Lagrangian density for\nnucleons [28], in which the couplings with the scalar-\nisoscalar σ, vector-isoscalar ωµ, and vector-isovector ⃗ρµ\nmesons, and the photon Aµ are included, i.e.,\nLN =\nX\ni=n,p\n¯ψi\nh\niγµ∂µ −Mi −gσiσ −gωiγµωµ\n−gρiγµ⃗τi · ⃗ρµ −eγµAµ\n1 −τi,3\n2\n#\nψi\n+ 1\n2∂µσ∂µσ −1\n2m2\nσσ2 −1\n3g2σ3 −1\n4g3σ4\n−1\n4ΩµνΩµν + 1\n2m2\nωωµωµ + 1\n4c3(ωµωµ)2\n−1\n4\n⃗Rµν · ⃗Rµν + 1\n2m2\nρ⃗ρµ · ⃗ρµ −1\n4FµνFµν,\n(2)\nwhere Mi (i = n, p) denotes the nucleon mass, ⃗τi is the\nisospin with the 3rd component τi,3 (+1 for neutrons and\n−1 for protons), and mϕ (ϕ = σ, ω, ρ) and gϕi are the\nmasses and coupling constants for mesons, respectively.\n2\n\n\nΩµν, ⃗Rµν, and Fµν are the field tensors for the ω and ⃗ρ\nmesons and photons. g2, g3, and c3 are the parameters\nintroduced in the nonlinear self-coupling terms.\nThe Lagrangian density LΛ represents the contribu-\ntions from Λ hyperons, in which only the couplings with\nthe σ and ωµ mesons are included because of Λ hyper-\nons being charge neutral and zero isospin, i.e.,\nLΛ = ¯ψΛ\nh\niγµ∂µ −MΛ −gσΛσ −gωΛγµωµ\n−fωΛΛ\n2mΛ\nσµν∂νωµ\n#\nψΛ,\n(3)\nwhere MΛ is the mass of the Λ hyperon, gσΛ and gωΛ are\nthe coupling constants with the σ and ω meson, respec-\ntively. To reproduce the small Λ spin-orbit splitting, a\nterm of ωΛΛ tensor coupling is introduced with fωΛΛ\nbeing the coupling constant.\nFor a system with time-reversal symmetry, the space-\nlike components of the vector fields ωµ and ⃗ρµ vanish,\nleaving only the time components ω0 and ⃗ρ0. Mean-\nwhile, charge conservation guarantees that only the\nthird component ρ0,3 in the isospin space of ⃗ρ0 ex-\nists. With the mean-field and no-sea approximations,\nthe single-particle Dirac equations for nucleons and hy-\nperons and the Klein-Gordon equations for mesons and\nphotons can be obtained by the variational procedure.\nWith spherical symmetry, the Dirac spinor for nucle-\nons and hyperons can be expanded as\nψnκm(r) = 1\nr\n \niGnκ(r)\n−Fnκ(r)σ · ˆr\n!\nYl\njm(θ, ϕ),\n(4)\nwhere Gnκ(r)/r and Fnκ(r)/r are the radial wave func-\ntions for the upper and lower components, Yl\njm(θ, ϕ) is\nthe spinor spherical harmonic. The quantum number κ\nis defined as κ = (−1) j+l+1/2( j + 1/2). With the radial\nwave functions, the radial Dirac equations for baryons\n(i = n, p, Λ) can be obtained as,\n\nVi + S i\n−d\ndr + κ\nr + Ti\nd\ndr + κ\nr + Ti\nVi −S i −2Mi\n\n Gnκ\nFnκ\n!\n= εnκ\n Gnκ\nFnκ\n!\n,\n(5)\nwhere S i, Vi, and Ti are respectively the mean-field\nscalar potential, vector potential, and the ωΛΛ tensor\npotential,\nS i = gσiσ,\n(6a)\nVi = gωiω0 + gρiτi,3ρ0,3 + 1\n2e(1 −τi,3)A0,\n(6b)\nTi = −fωΛΛ\n2Mi\n∂rω0.\n(6c)\nNote that the terms related to ρ0,3 and A0 in Eq. ( 6b)\nare zero for Λ hyperons, while the tensor potential in\nEq. (6c) is zero for nucleons. The ωΛΛ tensor interac-\ntion was introduced to reproduce the experimentally ob-\nserved small spin-orbit splitting for Λ hyperon [36, 37].\nThe Klein-Gordon equations for mesons and photons\nare\n(∂µ∂µ + m2\nϕ)ϕ = S ϕ,\n(7)\nwith the source terms\nS ϕ =\n\nP\ni=n,p,Λ\n−gσiρsi −g2σ2 −g3σ3,\nϕ = σ;\nP\ni=n,p,Λ\ngωiρvi + fωΛΛ\n2MΛ ∂k j0k\nTΛ −c3ω3\n0,\nϕ = ω;\nP\ni=n,p gρiτi,3ρvi,\nϕ = ρ;\neρc,\nϕ = A;\n(8)\nwhere ρsi and ρvi are the scalar and vector densities for\nnucleons and hyperons, j0k\nTΛ is the tensor density for Λ\nhyperons, and ρc is the charge density for protons.\nWith the radial wave functions, those densities in\nEq.

ΛN CSB interaction\nIn analogy of non-relativistic CSB interaction [43],\nwe introduce a simple ΛN charge symmetry breaking\n(CSB) interaction as\nVΛN\nCS B = 1\n2VΛN\n0\nA\nX\nk=1\n¯ψΛγµψΛ ¯ψkγµτ3ψk,\n(11)\nwhere VΛN\n0\nis the strength of CSB interaction, τ3 is the\n3rd component of isospin for neutrons or protons. The\n3\n\n\nenergy density functional is obtained for the interaction\n(11) as,\nεΛN = 1\n2VΛN\n0\nρΛ(ρn −ρp),\n(12)\nwhere ρn(r) and ρp(r) are the baryon densities of neu-\ntron and proton, respectively. With this CSB interaction,\nthe attractive Λn interaction is strengthen while Λp in-\nteraction is weaken for a negative VΛN\n0\nvalue.\nWith or without the ΛN CSB interaction, the Dirac\nequations for baryons (n, p, Λ), the Klein-Gordon equa-\ntions for mesons and photon, the mean-field potentials,\nand densities in the RMF model are solved by iteration\nprocedure in the coordinate space. The single-Λ bind-\ning energy BΛ is calculated by using a formula,\nBΛ(Z, N, 1) = B(A\nΛZ) −B(A−1Z),\n(13)\nwhere B(A\nΛZ) and B(A−1Z) are the binding energies for\nthe single-Λ hypernuclei and the corresponding core nu-\nclei, respectively. The difference in single-Λ binding\nenergies between mirror hypernuclei is then defined for\nN ≥Z as\n∆BΛ(A = N + Z) = BΛ(Z, N, 1) −BΛ(N, Z, 1).\n(14)\nEquations in the RMF model are solved in the co-\nordinate space with a size of R = 20 fm and a step\nsize of ∆r = 0.05 fm.\nFor the NN interaction, the\nPK1 [38] and TM2 [39] parameter sets are adopted.\nFor the ΛN interactions, the parameters are listed in Ta-\nble 1. With those NN and ΛN interactions, the single-\nΛ binding energy in 12\nΛ C [40] and the Λ 1p spin-orbit\nsplitting in 13\nΛ C [41] are well reproduced as BΛ=11.3\nMeV and E(1/2−) −E(3/2−)=0.152 MeV, respectively.\nThe single-Λ binding energy in the heavier hypernu-\ncleus 40\nΛ Ca can also be well given, and it is predicted\nto be 19.24 and 18.45 MeV with PK1 and TM2 EDFs,\nrespectively, while the experimental value is reported as\n18.7 ± 1.1 MeV [42]. The parameter VΛN\n0\nin the CSB\ninteraction is determined to reproduce the Λ binding en-\nergy difference of the A = 12 mirror hypernuclei 12\nΛ B\nand 12\nΛ C, i.e., ∆BΛ = 0.229 MeV given by the exper-\nimental values of BΛ = 11.529 ± 0.025 MeV for 12\nΛ B\n[24] and 11.30 ± 0.19 MeV for 12\nΛ C [22], both in their\nground states. It is noted that the error bar of BΛ for\n12\nΛ C is much larger than that for 12\nΛ B. Here we focus on\nthe centroid values of BΛs in these two hypernuclei with\nCSB effect. To reproduce this value, VΛN\n0\nis determined\nas given in Table 1. The upper and lower limits of the\nΛN CSB strength are also evaluated by considering the\nexperimental uncertainties of binding energies.\nTable 1: Parameters of the ΛN interactions in the RMF model.\nPK1\nTM2\ngσΛ/gσN\n0.6206\n0.6233\ngωΛ/gωN\n0.6666\n0.6666\nfωΛΛ/fωN\n-1.1174\n-1.1210\nVΛN\n0\n(MeV fm3)\n-33.05\n-38.00\nupper limit\n-63.15\n-72.00\nlower limit\n-2.85\n-3.70\n- 0 . 2\n0 . 0\n0 . 2\n0 . 4\n0 . 6\n0 . 8\n e x p\n w\ni t h  C S B\n w\n/ o   C S B\n7\nL H e - 7\nL B e\n1 0\nL B e - 1 0\nL B\n1 2\nL B - 1 2\nL C\n4 0\nL K - 4 0\nL C a\n4 8\nL C a - 4 8\nL C o\nP K 1\nD B\nL  ( M\ne V )\nA = 7\nA = 1 0\nA = 1 2\nA = 4 0\nA = 4 8\n( c )\n( d )\n( a )\n( b )\n- 0 . 2\n0 . 0\n0 . 2\n0 . 4\n0 . 6\n0 . 8\nD B\nL  ( M\ne V )\n7\nL H e - 7\nL B e\n1 0\nL B e - 1 0\nL B\n1 2\nL B - 1 2\nL C\n4 0\nL K - 4 0\nL C a\n4 8\nL C a - 4 8\nL C o\nT M\n2\nA = 7\nA = 1 0\nA = 1 2\nA = 4 0\nA = 4 8\n( c )\n( d )\n( a )\n( b )\nFigure 1:\nThe differences ∆BΛ of the single-Λ binding energy be-\ntween the mirror hypernuclei (7\nΛHe, 7\nΛBe), (10\nΛ Be, 10\nΛ B), (12\nΛ B, 12\nΛ C),\n(40\nΛ K, 40\nΛ Ca), and (48\nΛ Ca, 48\nΛ Co) obtained by the RMF models with and\nwithout the ΛN CSB interaction, in comparison with the experimental\ndata. The upper (lower) panel shows results with PK1(TM2) EDF. In\n10\nΛ Be-10\nΛ B, we cite two experimental data specified in (a) and (b).\n3. Results and discussions\nUsing CSB ΛN interaction, we first examine the\nlighter mirror Λ hypernuclei with A = 7 and A = 10,\nsuch as (7\nΛHe, 7\nΛBe) and (10\nΛ Be, 10\nΛ B), as shown in Fig. 1.\nAmong these, 7\nΛHe and 7\nΛBe are the lightest p-shell Λ\nhypernuclei for the discussions on CSB effect. The 7\nΛBe\nwas observed by emulsion and the binding energy in the\nground state is 5.16 ± 0.08 MeV [7]. The binding en-\nergy BΛ of 7\nΛHe in the ground state has been measured\n4\n\n\nto be 5.55 ± 0.10 (stat) ± 0.11 (syst) MeV [19] at JLab.\nThus, ∆BΛ = BΛ(7\nΛHe) −BΛ(7\nΛBe) = 0.39 MeV. As\nshown in Fig. 1, our calculated ∆BΛ is about 0.37 MeV\nby PK1 EDF, which is close to the data of 0.39 MeV\nwhen the ΛN interaction is fitted to reproduce the cen-\ntroid data of the ∆BΛ for A = 12 mirror Λ hypernuclei.\nWe also fit the ΛN interaction strengths to reproduce the\nbinding energy differences across the range of observed\nvalues.\nThese results are shown by the blue-colored\nbars. Our results for A = 7 hypernuclei are consistent\nwith the data within one σ deviation. Especially, it is\nin good agreement with the data if we use PK1 EDF.\nFor A = 10 mirror hypernuclei, our calculated ∆BΛ is\nabout 0.2 MeV by both PK1 and TM2 EDFs. As pre-\nviously mentioned, there are two interpretations of the\nexperimental data for A = 10 Λ hypernuclei. One in-\nterpretation, based on Refs. [21, 22, 23], yields a value\nof 0.22 MeV, which is consistent with our results (see\nFig. 1(a)). The other interpretation, corresponding to\nFig. 1(b), gives a value of -0.04 MeV, which is inconsis-\ntent with our findings. Due to these conflicting interpre-\ntations, it is challenging to give definitive conclusions\non the CSB effect in A = 10 Λ hypernuclei. Therefore,\nfurther high-resolution experimental data are needed. In\nfact, it is already planned to measure the binding energy\nof 10\nΛ B with improved accuracy in the J-PARC E94 ex-\nperiment [44].\nNext, based on these results, we discuss the ∆BΛ val-\nues for mirror Λ hypernuclei with A = 40 and 48. For\nthe combination of 40\nΛ K and 40\nΛ Ca, Fig. 1 shows that\n∆BΛ ∼0 without CSB. When CSB interaction is in-\ncluded, the calculated ∆BΛ = 0.1 MeV. For 40\nΛ K, at\nJLab, it is planned to produce this hypernucleus by the\n(e, e′K+) reaction using a 40Ca target and measure the\nbinding energy of the ground state with a resolution\nof 100 keV. Meanwhile, it is possible to produce 40\nΛ Ca\nby the (π+, K+) reaction at J-PARC using a 40Ca target.\nThus, it would be possible to see the CSB effect by these\nexperiments.\nMoreover, at JLab, they plan to use a 48Ca target to\nproduce 48\nΛ K by (e, e′K+) reaction. The calculated bind-\ning energy of 48\nΛ K is 21.08 (20.68) MeV for PK1 EDF\nwith (without) ΛN CSB interaction, from which we can\nalso see the effect of CSB. We also calculate the bind-\ning energy difference between A = 48 mirror hypernu-\nclei 48\nΛ Ca and 48\nΛ Co to be 0.378 (0.068) MeV with (with-\nout) CSB. We see a more pronounced CSB effect com-\npared to the case of A = 40 hypernuclei.

From this fact,\nit would be better to see ∆BΛ in the mirror hypernuclei\n40\nΛ K and 40\nΛ Ca, using the 40Ca target by (e, e′K+) reaction\nat JLab and by (π+, K+) reaction at J-PARC.\nRecently, the importance of the spin dependent\nhyperon-nucleon CSB interaction was suggested in light\nhypernuclear systems in Refs. [17, 45, 46].\nFor in-\nstances, Ref. [46] demonstrated that the effects of this\nspin dependence can vary significantly, even in sign, for\nA = 7 and A = 8 hypernuclei. In this work, we also ex-\namine the impact of spin-dependent CSB by introducing\nthe following spin-spin interaction and spin-spin CSB\ninteraction,\nVNΛ\nσσ = gNΛ⃗σN · ⃗σΛ,\n(15)\nVCSB\nNΛ = gCSB\nNΛ ⃗σN · ⃗σΛ\n1\n2(τN\nz + τΛ\nz ),\n(16)\nwhere the interaction strength parameters gNΛ and gCSB\nNΛ\nare fixed to reproduce the spin-doublet states in A = 12\nmirror Λ hypernuclei [24]. The observed energy split-\nting between the 1−and 2−spin-doublet states is 0.162\nMeV in 12\nΛ C and 0.179 MeV in 12\nΛ B, resulting in a small\ncontribution from the spin-spin CSB interaction of only\n0.017 MeV. Using the spin-spin and spin-spin CSB in-\nteractions, we further predict the energy splittings for\n5\n\n\n4 0\n4 2\n4 4\n4 6\n4 8\n0 . 0\n0 . 2\n0 . 4\n0 . 6\n4 8\nL C a - 4 8\nL C o\n4 6\nL C a - 4 6\nL M\nn\n4 4\nL C a - 4 4\nL V\n4 2\nL C a - 4 2\nL S c\n4 0\nL K - 4 0\nL C a\nD B\nL  ( M\ne V )\nM\na s s  n u m\nb e r  A\n w\ni t h  C S B\n w\n/ o   C S B\nFigure 3:\nThe single-Λ binding energy differences ∆BΛ between\nthe mirror hypernuclei with different mass number, i.e., (40\nΛ K, 40\nΛ Ca),\n(42\nΛ Ca, 42\nΛ Sc), (44\nΛ Ca, 44\nΛ V), (46\nΛ Ca, 46\nΛ Mn), (48\nΛ Ca, 48\nΛ Co), obtained with\nthe PK1 EDF with and without ΛN CSB interaction.\nthe ground state doublets in 40\nΛ K-40\nΛ Ca, and 48\nΛ Ca-48\nΛ Co,\nrespectively.\nThe calculated energy splitting for 40\nΛ K\nand 40\nΛ Ca are 0.1074MeV and 0.0972MeV, respectively,\nwhile those for 48\nΛ Ca and 48\nΛ Co are 0.1389 MeV and\n0.1534 MeV, respectively. Then the contributions from\nthe spin-spin CSB term are finally obtained to be 0.0102\nfor A = 40 and -0.0145 MeV for A = 48, which are\nnegligibly small compared to the obtained ∆BΛ values\nof 0.089 ± 0.059 MeV and 0.378 ± 0.205 MeV, respec-\ntively.\nSecond, let us explain the reason why CSB effect of\n(40\nΛ Ca, 40\nΛ K) is rather small, i.e., ∆BΛ=0.09 MeV. It is\nnoted that the isospin of (40\nΛ Ca, 40\nΛ K) is T = 1/2. Gen-\nerally speaking, it is better to see ∆BΛ for study of CSB\nin systems with larger total isospins. In Fig. 2, we show\nthe calculated ∆BΛ for (40\nΛ Ar, 40\nΛ Sc) with T = 3/2 and\nfor (40\nΛ Cl, 40\nΛ Ti) with T = 5/2. We find that the cal-\nculated ∆BΛ becomes larger with increasing T, that is,\n∆BΛ ∼0.25 MeV for (40\nΛ Ar, 40\nΛ Sc) and ∆BΛ ∼0.4 MeV\nfor (40\nΛ Cl, 40\nΛ Ti) with T = 5/2, as increasing total isospin\nT. To produce the mirror hypernuclei (40\nΛ Ar, 40\nΛ Sc) and\n(40\nΛ Cl and 40\nΛ Ti), 40Ar, 40Sc, 40Cl, and 40Ti target can\nbe used by (π+, K+) reaction and for the production of\n40\nΛ Cl and 40\nΛ Sc, we also can use 40Ar and 40Ti targets by\n(e, e′K+) reaction at JLab.\nAs another way to see CSB effect, we propose to use\nCa target. Because, several Ca targets such as 40Ca,\n42Ca, 44Ca, 46Ca, and 48Ca are available for experiments\nto produce hypernuclei.\nBy (π+, K+) reaction, 40\nΛ Ca,\n42\nΛ Ca, 44\nΛ Ca, 46\nΛ Ca, and 48\nΛ Ca can be produced.\nIn Fig. 3, we show the calculated ∆BΛ between hyper\nCa isotopes and the corresponding mirror hypernuclei.\n3 / 2\n5 / 2\n7 / 2\n9 / 2\n2 0 . 8\n2 1 . 0\n2 1 . 2\n2 1 . 4\n3 / 2\n5 / 2\n7 / 2\n9 / 2\n2 0 . 2\n2 0 . 4\n2 0 . 6\n2 0 . 8\nA = 4 8\n4 8\nL K\n4 8\nL C a\n4 8\nL S c\n w\ni t h  C S B\n w\n/ o   C S B\nB\nL  ( M\ne V )\n4 8\nL T i\nP K 1\n( a )\n4 8\nL K\n4 8\nL C a\n4 8\nL S c\nB\nL  ( M\ne V )\nT\n4 8\nL T i\nT M\n2\n( b )\nFigure 4:\nThe single-Λ binding energies BΛ for the A = 48 hyper-\nnuclei, i.e., 48\nΛ Ti, 48\nΛ Sc, 48\nΛ Ca, 48\nΛ K with isospin T = 3/2, 5/2, 7/2, 9/2,\nobtained by the RMF model with and without ΛN CSB interaction.\nThe upper (lower) panel shows results with PK1(TM2) EDF.\nThe calculated ∆BΛ becomes larger with larger neutron\nnumber. For A = 48, the calculated ∆BΛ is about 0.4\nMeV with CSB effect, which is significantly large. If\nwe could obtain the observed binding energies of 48\nΛ Ca\nand 48\nΛ Co, it is useful for the study of CSB effect in ΛN\ninteraction. However, it is difficult to produce 48\nΛ Co due\nto the lack of an appropriate target.\nIn this way, we understand that the larger CSB effect\nis associated with nuclei with larger isospins, that is, it\nis better to see the binding energies of A = 48 hyper-\nnuclei if there are some target. Along this line, let us\nexamine nuclei with A = 48 isobars. Using 48Ti, 48Sc,\n48Ca, and 48K as targets, we could produce 48\nΛ Ti, 48\nΛ Sc,\n48\nΛ Ca, and 48\nΛ K by (π+, K+) reaction. Figure 4 shows the\nbinding energies of the ground states of these Λ hyper-\nnuclei with/without CSB ΛN interaction. We see that\ncalculated BΛ without CSB interaction for these hyper-\nnuclei are about 20.8 MeV with PK1 EDF in Fig. 4(a),\nand the isospin dependence is small. This is also the\ncase in the TM2 EDF shown in Fig. 4(b), having the\n6\n\n\nlargest CSB effect in 48\nΛ K. When we include the CSB in-\nteraction, it is seen that the calculated BΛs increase with\nlarger number of total isospin T. It is interesting to see\nthat calculated BΛ of 48\nΛ K is the largest among A = 48 Λ\nhypernuclei. Using 48Ca target, it is possible to produce\n48\nΛ K by (e, e′K+) reaction at JLab.\n7\n\n\nTable 2: The single-Λ binding energies BΛ as well as the difference ∆BΛ in mirror hypernuclei with the same total isospin T and opposite the third components Tz calculated by PK1 EDF with\nor without NΛ CSB interaction.

Summary\nWe studied the CSB effect in the binding energy of\nhyperon in the mass region of A = 7 ∼48 in the RMF\nmodels introducing NN, and ΛN interactions. The phe-\nnomenological ΛN CSB interaction is introduced and\nthe strength parameter is fitted to reproduce the exper-\nimental binding energy difference between the mirror\nhypernuclei 12\nΛ B and 12\nΛ C. This model is applied to calcu-\nlate the CSB energy anomaly in A=7 and 10 mirror hy-\npernuclei. We found that our result for A = 7 mirror hy-\npernuclei is consistent with the data. On the other hand,\nin A = 10 hypernuclei, due to uncertainties of the exper-\nimental data is large, it is difficult to conclude whether\nour results are consistent or not with experimental data.\nIn the future at J-PARC, it is planned to measure the\nbinding energy of 10\nΛ Be with better accuracy [44]. It\nmight be possible to discuss on CSB effect of A = 10 Λ\nhypernuclei with future experimental data. The model is\nfurther applied to predict the binding energy difference\nof A=40 mirror hypernuclei with the isospin T = 1/2,\n3/2, and 5/2 nuclei together with various hyper Ca iso-\ntopes and the corresponding mirror hypernuclei. Finally\nthe binding energy systematics of A =48 isobars of hy-\npernuclei are predicted with/without the CSB EDF. The\nfuture experimental observations in JLab and J-PARC\nare desperately wanted to confirm the CSB effect in hy-\npernuclei especially in the medium-heavy hypernuclei,\nA = 40 ∼48.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank Dr.\nT.

    "abstract": "We study the charge symmetry breaking (CSB) effect in the binding energy of\nmirror hypernuclei in the mass region $A=7\\sim 48$ in relativistic mean field\n(RMF) models introducing $NN$ and $\\Lambda N$ interactions. The\nphenomenological $\\Lambda N$ CSB interaction is introduced and the strength\nparameter is fitted to reproduce the experimental binding energy difference\nbetween the mirror hypernuclei $^{12}_\\Lambda$B and $^{12}_\\Lambda$C. This\nmodel is applied to calculate the CSB energy anomaly in mirror hypernuclei with\nthe mass $A=7\\sim48$. The model is further applied to predict the binding\nenergy difference of mirror hypernuclei of $A$=40 with the isospin $T=1/2$,\n$3/2$ and $5/2$ nuclei together with various hyper Ca isotopes and their mirror\nhypernuclei. Finally the binding energy systematics of $A=$48 hypernuclei are\npredicted with/without the CSB effect by the PK1 and TM2 energy density\nfunctionals (EDFs).",
