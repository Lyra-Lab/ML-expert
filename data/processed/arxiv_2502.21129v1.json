Unlike the Ensemble Average\nPropagator indices or the Diffusion Tensor Imaging metrics, MPI indices are independent\nfrom the mesoscopic organization of the tissue such as the presence of multiple axonal bundle\ndirections and orientation dispersion. As a consequence, MPI indices are more specific to\nthe volumes, sizes, and types of microstructures, like axons and cells, that are present in the\ntissue. Thus, changes in MPI indices can be more directly linked to alterations in the presence\nand integrity of microstructures themselves. The methodology behind MPI is rooted on zonal\nmodeling of spherical harmonics, signal simulation, and machine learning regression, and is\ndemonstrated on both synthetic and Human Diffusion MRI data.\n1. Introduction\nOne of the most prominent ways to harness the information obtained with Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(dMRI) is the calculation, for each voxel in the acquired image volume, of the Ensemble Average Propagator (EAP)\n(Callaghan et al., 1988). This encodes probabilistic information about diffusion of water particles (spins) within the\ntissue contained in the voxel’s volume. Due to the interaction of water with the boundaries and membranes of axons,\ncells, and other microstructures, such probabilistic information speaks of the geometrical properties (like volume\noccupancies, sizes, and shapes) of the microstructures themselves. A variety of methods have been developed to\nretrieve the EAP and its scalar descriptors, sometimes referred to as indices. Among the most used ones we find the\nreturn-to-origin/axis/plane-probabilities (RTOP, RTAP, RTPP), and the non-Gaussianity (NG), which measures how\ndifferent the EAP is from a Gaussian distribution. The indices enable us to readily understand and compare differences\nbetween EAPs, and to characterize the diffusion process in different brain regions. For instance, RTOP is related to\nthe reciprocal of the more common Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) index called \"mean diffusivity\" (MD). When MD\nis high – for instance in the brain ventricles where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diffusion is not hindered by barriers –\nRTOP is low, and vice versa. Unlike biophysical models, which interpret the dMRI signal a sum of contributions from\na predefined set of water compartments (with or without exchange of water between them), EAP methods strives to\nkeep a \"compartment-agnostic\" approach, thus virtually making no such assumptions. Technically, the EAP retrieved\nfrom dMRI describes the average displacement of the water molecules trajectory’s center of mass (Mitra and Halperin,\n1995) accrued during the first and second gradient pulses of a pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) sequence (Stejskal\nand Tanner, 1965), at a given diffusion time. As such, it is affected by the mesoscopic organization of the tissue and\nin particular by the plurality of directions along which anisotropic structures, like axons, are aligned. In fact, even\nthough the displacements inside of an axon mainly occur along its longitudinal direction (being diffusion restricted\nperpendicularly to it), the displacements inside of a multitude of axons occur in principle along as many directions as\nthose axons are aligned. The EAP is thus clearly affected by the probability distribution of orientations of the anisotropic\nmicrostructures, known as the (fiber) orientation distribution function (ODF), inside the voxel. At the same time,\nhowever, the displacements are also determined by the geometry of axons, for instance by their sizes, but also by the\nrelative abundance of axons themselves, cells (somas), and extra-axonal/cellular space. As a consequence, the values of\n∗Corresponding author\nmapiz@dtu.dk pizzolato.marco.research@gmail.com (M. Pizzolato)\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/pizzolatomarco/ (M.

Therefore, it is impossible to speculate on whether, in a specific voxel, an abnormally\nlow RTAP (for example) is due to an atypical configuration of axonal orientations or to microstructural alterations in\nthe presence/size/integrity of axons and cells.\nWe propose Microscopic Propagator Imaging (MPI) as a novel method to retrieve the propagator-based indices\nthat are unaffected by the presence of multiple bundle directions and orientation dispersion. This is achieved by\nisolating the indices of the microscopic propagator, which is the EAP of the rotational signal kernel that, when\nconvolved with the ODF, \"reconstructs\" the dMRI signal. MPI thus isolates the contribution of the kernel signal to\nthe overall EAP from that of the ODF. In other words, MPI indices only reflect the diffusion process pertaining to\n\"non-dispersed\" microstructures, and are only indicative of the abundance, geometries, sizes, thereby the integrity, of\nthe microstructures present in the tissue.\n2. Theory\nThe diffusion-weighted MRI signal arising from tissue microstructures can be expressed as a sum of the\ncontributions from 𝑁compartments. In particular, for a given b-value 𝑏= 𝑞2(Δ −𝛿∕3) with 𝑞= 𝛾𝐺𝛿and Δ, 𝛿, 𝐺and\n𝛾being respectively the gradient pulse separation, duration, amplitude, and the gyromagnetic ratio of the hydrogen\natom, we have\n𝑆(𝑏, 𝜃, 𝜙) =\n𝑁\n∑\n𝑛=1\n𝑆0𝑛\n{\n𝐿\n∑\n𝑙=0,𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛\n𝜅𝑛\n𝑙(𝑏|p𝑛)\n𝑙∑\n𝑚=−𝑙\n𝑐\n′\n𝑙𝑚𝑌𝑚\n𝑙(𝜃, 𝜙)\n}\n(1)\nwhere 𝜃and 𝜙are the spherical coordinates of the normalized diffusion gradient vector (the sampled diffusion\ndirection), 𝑆0𝑛= 𝑆𝑛(0, 𝜃, 𝜙) = 𝑆𝑛(0) the constant that accounts for the relaxation and the volume fraction of\nthe 𝑛-th compartment, and where p𝑛is a generic vector of parameters for the 𝑛-th compartment. The spherical\nharmonics 𝑌𝑚\n𝑙(𝜃, 𝜙) are those defined by Descoteaux et al. (2007), and the 𝑙-degree subscript only assumes even\nvalues, corresponding to even spherical harmonics, because of the symmetry of the diffusion process. Note that eq. 1,\nas it is usual in dMRI (Christiaens et al., 2020), implies that the compartments share the same ODF\nODF(𝜃, 𝜙) =\n𝐿\n∑\n𝑙=0,𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛\n𝑙∑\n𝑚=−𝑙\n𝑐\n′\n𝑙𝑚𝑌𝑚\n𝑙(𝜃, 𝜙) ≥0 ∀𝜃∈[0, 𝜋], 𝜙∈[0, 2𝜋]\n(2)\nwhere 𝑐\n′\n𝑙𝑚are the coefficients of the SH expansion of the ODF, and their values are typically unknown. By rearranging\nthe order of the sums\n𝑆(𝑏, 𝜃, 𝜙) =\n𝐿\n∑\n𝑙=0,𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛\n{ 𝑁\n∑\n𝑛=1\n𝑆0𝑛𝜅𝑛\n𝑙(𝑏|p𝑛)\n}\n⏟⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏟⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏟\n𝐾𝑙(𝑏|p)\n𝑙∑\n𝑚=−𝑙\n𝑐\n′\n𝑙𝑚𝑌𝑚\n𝑙(𝜃, 𝜙)\n(3)\nthe 𝑁zonal functions of zonal degree 𝑙, 𝜅𝑛\n𝑙(𝑏|p𝑛) can be aggregated to form the more complex zonal functions 𝐾𝑙(𝑏|p),\nwhere p indicates a generic vector comprising all possible parameters. Note that these may generally include also\nparameters related to exchange between compartments. These new zonal functions are the zonal harmonic coefficients\nof the convolutional/rotational kernel signal, which may be reconstructed as\n𝑆𝐾(𝑏, 𝜃, 𝜙) =\n𝐿\n∑\n𝑙=0,𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛\n𝐾𝑙(𝑏|p)𝑌0\n𝑙(𝜃, 𝜙)\n(4)\nZajac, Menegaz, & Pizzolato\nPage 2 of 14\n\n\nMicroscopic Propagator Imaging\nup to a maximum SH degree 𝐿. Further rearranging the summations, we observe that the zonal functions are actually\npart of the coefficients 𝑐𝑙𝑚(𝑏) of a generic SH expansion of the directional dMRI on the shell at b-value 𝑏\n𝑆(𝑏, 𝜃, 𝜙) =\n𝐿\n∑\n𝑙=0,𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛\n𝑙∑\n𝑚=−𝑙\n𝑐\n′\n𝑙𝑚𝐾𝑙(𝑏|p)\n⏟⏞⏞⏞⏟⏞⏞⏞⏟\n𝑐𝑙𝑚(𝑏)\n𝑌𝑚\n𝑙(𝜃, 𝜙)\n=\n𝐿\n∑\n𝑙=0,𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛\n𝑙∑\n𝑚=−𝑙\n𝑐𝑙𝑚(𝑏)𝑌𝑚\n𝑙(𝜃, 𝜙)\n(5)\nfrom which the coefficients can be estimated by solving a linear system. At a given b-value, we can then calculate the\n𝑙-band power spectra for each zonal degree 𝑙= 0, 2, … , 𝐿as\nΘ𝑙(𝑏) =\n𝑙∑\n𝑚=−𝑙\n𝑐𝑙𝑚(𝑏)2\n= 𝐾𝑙(𝑏|p)2\n𝑙∑\n𝑚=−𝑙\n(\n𝑐\n′\n𝑙𝑚\n)2\n(6)\nwhich are rotational invariants, meaning that no matter how the dMRI signal is rotated, the power spectra will remain\nconstant (Zucchelli et al., 2020). Of more interest are the ratios between spectra of the same degree 𝑙of dMRI signals\nwith different b-values, as they additionally are independent from the ODF (Reisert et al., 2017; Pizzolato et al., 2023).\nIn particular, for two non-zero b-values 𝑏𝑖≠𝑏𝑗we can define the root-square 𝑙-band power spectral ratios (which we\nwill simply call ratios) as\n𝛼𝑙\n(𝑏𝑖, 𝑏𝑗|p) ∶=\n√\nΘ𝑙(𝑏𝑖)\nΘ𝑙(𝑏𝑗) =\n|||||\n𝐾𝑙\n(𝑏𝑖|p)\n𝐾𝑙\n(𝑏𝑗|p)\n|||||\n(7)\nwhich clearly only depend on the parameter vector p, the b-values, and the functional forms of the zonal functions.\nGiven any two signal shells, both expanded to a maximum degree 𝐿it is then possible to obtain 𝐿∕2 + 1 independent\nratios. Reisert et al. (2017) regressed similar ratios with respect to the parameters of a signal kernel corresponding to\nthe \"standard model\" of white matter diffusion Novikov et al. (2019), discovering that degeneracy (Jelescu et al., 2016)\noccurred when using PGSE data. Therefore, not all parameters of the model (fractions and diffusivities) could be\nuniquely identified. Here we make the hypothesis that, instead, the indices of the kernel’s propagator, in particular\nindices like the \"return-to probabilities\" and non-Gaussianity, can be recovered from the ratios. If so, we would\nbe able to train a machine learning regression method that learns the mapping between the ratios 𝛼𝑙(𝑏𝑖, 𝑏𝑗|p) (plus\neventually other signal rotational invariants) and the indices of the kernel’s propagator, which are the MPI indices of\nthe microscopic propagator.\n3. Methods\nThe methodology consists of a learning part followed by an inference part. The learning part is focused on training\nthe parameters of a regressor that maps the indices of the microscopic propagator, labels, to a mix of rotationally\ninvariant and ODF-independent (the ratios) features of the multi-shell dMRI signal. The training is performed using\nsynthetically generated labels and features (matching the protocol of the acquired dataset). After the training has been\ncompleted, the features of the acquired signal are calculated and fed as input to the regressor to obtain the estimates of\nthe MPI indices.\n3.1. Microscopic propagator indices\nTo perform the regression between the ratios and the MPI indices it is necessary to generate a database of\nsynthetic signals on which to compute the ratios (features) and the sought indices of the microscopic propagator\nsuch as RTOPMPI, RTAPMPI, etc. (labels). The overall methodology is illustrated in Fig. 1. The generation of the\nsynthetic signal features needs to target the desired acquisition scheme, namely the set of gradient directions (𝜃, 𝜙),\nZajac, Menegaz, & Pizzolato\nPage 3 of 14\n\n\nMicroscopic Propagator Imaging\nFigure 1: The framework implementing the concept of microscopic propagator imaging for what concerns the generation\nof (signal) features and (kernel) labels to be learned.\nb-values (𝑏), pulse duration (𝛿), pulse separation (Δ), and optionally the echo time (TE). In this work, we simulated\nthe signal with a multi-compartment model comprising three main tissues: white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and\ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF was modeled as isotropic Gaussian diffusion (ball) with intrinsic diffusion coefficient\nin range [2.9e -9, 3.1e -9]m2/s. GM was modeled as extra-cellular diffusion using a ball of diffusivity in range\n[0.85e -9, 1.3e -9]m2/s, plus an intra-cellular part, representing neuronal and other cellular somas, comprising of an\nensemble of spheres which radii follow a Gamma distribution with mode in range [3, 30]𝜇m, using intrinsic diffusivity\nof 1.7e -9 m2/s (Fick et al., 2019). White Matter (WM) was modeled as the sum of three compartments. An intra-\naxonal part comprising of cylinders with radii following a Gamma distribution with mode in range [0.2, 0.25]𝜇m,\nusing intrinsic diffusivity in range [1.5e -9, 3.0e -9]m2/s (Pizzolato et al., 2023). A cellular component comprising of\na set of smaller spheres was also added to account for the presence of glial and endothelial cells. Finally, an extra-\naxonal part was added and modeled with a zeppelin (axisymmetric tensor) of axial and radial diffusivities in range\n[0.9e -9, 1.6e -9]m2/s. For the attenuation due to spheres and cylinders the Gaussian Phase Approximation formulas\nwere used (Neuman, 1974; Balinov et al., 1993; Vangelderen et al., 1994). The Gamma distributions for the sphere\nand cylinder radii were defined by the two shape parameters to obtain the desired mode. In all cases, size distributions\nwere based on informed guesses (Liewald et al., 2014) (and wide ranges) to cover all possible biological variability.\nTransverse relaxation attenuation was also simulated for each compartment, to improve the realism of the simulated\nsignal, to correctly account for noise, and to account for potential differences in the echo time of the targeted acquisition\nscheme. The ranges of 𝑇2 times were in [0.035, 0.065]s for the intra-axonal compartment, [0.06,0.08]s for the extra-\naxonal one, [0.02, 0.04]s for the spheres, [0.07, 0.1]s for the extra-axonal/cellular compartments, while CSF’s 𝑇2\nwas fixed to 2s. The tissue fractions and the relative fractions within the tissue were randomly generated following\nDirichlet or uniform distributions. By randomly generating 2 million different realizations of the modeling parameters,\nwe obtained as many kernel signals through the evaluation of the resulting multi-compartment model, which was\naligned along a specific direction (e.g. z-axis). Then each kernel signal was fitted using the MAPL (Fick et al., 2016)\nversion of MAP-MRI (Özarslan et al., 2013) to obtain microscopic MPI indices. In addition to the mentioned RTOP,\nRTAP, and RTPP, parallel and perpendicular non-Gaussianity indices NG∥, NG⟂were also estimated. These constitute\nthe ground-truth labels to be learned.\n3.2. Signal features\nThe kernel signal was then convolved by an ODF selected from a database of realistic ODFs obtained from Multi-\nshell Multi-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution (Jeurissen et al., 2014) (MSMT-CSD) on a variety of datasets.\nWe made sure to convolve with ODFs with spherical variance significantly higher than zero (we selected ODFs with\nvariance above the 80th percentile in our database) to avoid causing the ratios of degree 𝑙≥2 to be null (Pizzolato\net al., 2022), which would prevent any effective learning during the regression phase, however a different approach\nmay be envisioned. Noise was added to the convolved signal according to a specified signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),\nfollowing a Gaussian noise distribution. This was chosen since we preprocessed the actual dMRI data using a Variance\nStabilization Transformation (VST) that removes the Rician bias (Foi, 2011). The noise was randomly selected for each\nZajac, Menegaz, & Pizzolato\nPage 4 of 14\n\n\nMicroscopic Propagator Imaging\nsignal example with standard deviation extracted from a uniform distribution with lower and upper bounds optimized\nto find those that yielded the best performance on the testing datasets. The noisy signal was divided by the simulated\nnon-attenuated signal (𝑏= 0) to which noise was also added and averaged over the number of 𝑏= 0 volumes in the\nacquisition scheme to replicate what was done for the acquired data. The obtained noisy attenuation signals were used to\nobtain the SH coefficients (Descoteaux et al., 2007) for each shell {𝑐𝑙𝑚(𝑏)}. With these, we calculated the power spectra\nof each shell and, from these, the ratios between them for the b-value pairs (1000, 3000), (1000, 5000), (1000, 10000),\n(3000,5000), (3000,10000), (5000, 10000). This process enables us to provide examples of spectra and ratios where the\nnoise distribution is the most similar to that of the features calculated on the acquired data. The SH coefficients obtained\nfrom the noisy attenuation signals were up to SH order 12, or 6 depending on the number of directions available for each\nshell. Therefore, for each shell, up to 4 (𝓁= 0, 2, 4, 6) or 7 𝓁-band power spectra (𝓁= 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) were obtained.\nThe final set of features included, in addition to the ratios, the so-called DC component, 𝑐00(𝑏), of each shell, which\ncorresponds to the spherical mean (powder averaged) attenuations. It is important to include these, since they enable\nthe regressor to discriminate between the presence and absence of signal (in addition to providing other significant\ninformation). In fact, the quotient resulting from the ration of two terms (the power spectra) will be dominated by\nnoise, thus uninformative, in the case when the terms are close to zero (for instance, in the brain ventricles).\n3.3. Machine learning regression\nThe mapping between the 2 million sets of features and the MPI indices was performed with a random forest (RF)\nregressor (Breiman, 2001). Each decision tree in the forest was trained on a random subset of the training set (bootstrap\naggregation) to improve performance and reduce the risk of overfitting. The goodness of a node split was determined\nby the Friedman mean squared error (Friedman, 2001). This was found to give a lower out-of-bag error compared to the\nconventional means squared error, which is connected to the fact that the selected features are correlated. Regression\nwas performed for fifteen different training datasets that differed from each other in the distribution used to randomly\nsample the SNR. The SNR distributions were obtained by varying the SNR ranges ([2, 315],[2, 500] and [2, 1000]) and\nthe shape parameters (𝛼and 𝛽) of a Beta distribution as (0.92,0.92), (1,1), (1.1,1.5), (1.5,1.1) and (1.5,1.5), as shown\nin 2. The first SNR range was extracted from real data (assuming a\n√\n2 increase in SNR due to denoising), the second\nand third were investigated to study the effect of a wider range of SNR in the training data. The shape parameters\nof the Beta distribution were arbitrary chosen to have a uniform SNR distribution (1,1), to give more weight to the\nrange’s extreme (0.92,0.92), or to weight more signal with low (1.1,1.5), high (1.5,1.1) or mid (1.5,1.5) SNR in the\ntraining set. The best SNR distribution for generating the synthetic data used to train the model was chosen as that\nminimizing the absolute error between the predicted and ground-truth labels in the testing set (unseen instances) and\nthe Wasserstein distance (Villani and Villani, 2009) between the distribution of the predicted labels and the distribution\nof the ground-truth ones in the testing set. The best performance was found using the Beta distribution with 𝛼= 𝛽= 1.5\nin the range [2, 1000]. Once the SNR distribution was established, the hyperparameters of the RF regressor were tuned\nwith a 3-fold cross-validation grid search based on the mean squared error (MSE) and the coefficient of determination\n(𝑅2). The hyper-parameters included in the search were the maximum depth of the trees ([automatic, 10, 20]), the\nmaximum number of features to take into consideration when splitting a node ([100%, 80%, ’sqrt’] w.r.t. the number of\nfeatures), the minimum number of samples in a node required to be considered a leaf ([2, 5]), the number of samples\nto draw with replacement from the training set to train a decision tree ([100%, 75%] w.r.t. the total number of samples\nin the training set), and the number of decision trees in the ensemble ([100, 200]). The best performance was found\nfor a maximum depth of 20, a maximum number of features to consider for splitting a node according to the square\nroot of the total number of features, a minimum of 5 samples in the leaf node, 0.75 of the total number of samples\nin the training set (1.5 million) to train each decision tree (leaving the rest for validation) and 100 decision trees. The\nresulting RF regressor was used for testing using unseen testing datasets.\n3.4. Synthetic testing datasets\nWe generated three different test datasets that included 1 million unseen instances each. The datasets were designed\nto match the expected tissue proportions and SNR ranges of the WM, GM, and CSF tissues of an HCP dataset. The\ndata generation model used was the same as for the training data. For each tissue type, the SNR range was established\nbased on that estimated in a real subject based on a segmentation of the WM, GM, and CSF regions obtained by\nestimating the corresponding tissue fractions with MSMT-CSD. Therefore, we simulated an SNR range of [11, 51]\nfor WM, of [16, 77] for GM, and of [24, 152] for CSF, which stems from the assumption of a\n√\n2 increase in SNR\n(compared to the original data) due to denoising. In addition, the simulated proportions of the volume fractions of\nZajac, Menegaz, & Pizzolato\nPage 5 of 14\n\n\nMicroscopic Propagator Imaging\nFigure 2: Probed SNR distributions for adding noise on the training data.\nWM, GM, and CSF were simulated by modifying the concentration parameters of the Dirichlet distributions to mimic\nthe fraction distributions found in the corresponding segmentation masks. The random seed was different from that\nused to generate the training dataset.\n3.5. MRI data\nData from 4 subjects of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) Adult Diffusion database collected at Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital (MGH) were used for the study (Setsompop et al., 2013). The single encoding diffusion-weighted\nimages (DWIs) were acquired using a monopolar PGSE sequence and are organized into 40 𝑏= 0 volumes plus\nfour shells: 64 directions for 𝑏= 1000 s/mm2 and for 𝑏= 3000 s/mm2, 128 directions for 𝑏= 5000 s/mm2 and 256\ndirections for 𝑏= 10000 s/mm2. Other parameters were: repetition time was TR= 8.8s, echo time TE= 57ms, gradient\npulse duration 𝛿= 12.9ms and separation Δ = 21.8ms, field of view FOV= 210mm x 210mm, acquisition matrix of\n140 x 140 voxels, for 96 slices producing a 1.5mm isotropic voxel size, iPAT=3, and partial Fourier 6/8. A complete\ndescription of the parameters is available on the Human Connectome website1. Data were acquired with a Siemens 3T\nMAGNETOM ConnectomA syngo MR D11 (Siemens Heathineers, Erlangen, Germany) capable of reaching a gradient\nstrength of approximately 300mT/m. Data were pre-processed as in Pizzolato et al. (2023), following a slightly modified\nversion of the pipeline described by Ma et al. (2020). The denoising is based on local principal component analysis\nusing optimal shrinkage with respect to the mean squared error (Gavish and Donoho, 2017) which follows a Rician\nvariance stabilization transformation (VST) (Foi, 2011), so that the denoising removes the Rician bias and increases\nthe SNR of the images. Gibbs ringing removal according to Kellner et al. (2016) was applied using the implementation\navailable in MRtrix32 (Tournier et al., 2019), followed finally by FSL’s eddy correction (Andersson and Sotiropoulos,\n2016).\n3.6. Implementation and visualization\nThe code has been implemented in Python3. The visualization of the results was performed with Matplotlib4\n(Hunter, 2007). The evaluation of the equations was carried out with NumPy5 (Harris et al., 2020) and SciPy6 (Virtanen\n1https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/document/mgh-adult-diffusion-data-acquisition-details\n2https://www.mrtrix.org/\n3https://www.python.org/\n4https://matplotlib.org/\n5https://numpy.org/\n6https://www.scipy.org/\nZajac, Menegaz, & Pizzolato\nPage 6 of 14\n\n\nMicroscopic Propagator Imaging\net al., 2020), the RF regressor model and the cross validation grid search were implemented with the Python library\nscikit-learn7 (Pedregosa et al., 2011). When constructing both the training and testing datasets, the SH coefficients were\nestimated using Laplace-Beltrami regularization (Descoteaux et al., 2007) with weight 𝜆= 1e -6 and maximum order\nof either 𝐿= 6 or 𝐿= 12 (depending on the number of directions in the shell). To generate the datasets with a large\nnumber of samples, we took advantage of the parallelization of the computation with Ray8 (Moritz et al., 2018). The\nMAPL model used to recover the ground-truth value of the microscopic indices was obtained from Dipy9 (Garyfallidis\net al., 2014) using a radial order of 12, anisotropic scaling and a Laplacian regularization weight of 0.01. To obtain\nMAP-MRI data on the four subjects, MAPL was used with radial order 8, anisotropic scaling, positivity constraint, and\nLaplacian weighting of 0.2, as these parameters enabled us to obtain maps with reduced number of \"failing\" voxels.\nThe simulation of the kernel signals and convolved signals was carried out using Dmipy10 (Fick et al., 2019).\n4. Results\nFigure 3: Error distributions and performance metrics across the white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal\nfluid (CSF) synthetic testing dataset.\nWe compared the ground-truth MPI indices with those predicted, for each of the synthetic testing datasets of WM,\nGM and CSF. Fig. 3 presents the error distributions, along with their mean and median values, and key performance\nmetrics such as the Coefficient of Determination (𝑅2) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). RMSE was calculated\nfor relative errors (rRMSE) for RTOP, RTAP, and RTPP, while non-relative errors were used for NG indices, since\nthey fall within the range [0,1]. Most of the relative error distributions for microscopic RTOP, RTAP and RTPP fall\nmainly within -10% and 10%, which, together with a 𝑅2 above 0.7, indicates good regression performance. A similar\n7https://www.scikit-learn.org/\n8https://www.ray.io/\n9https://dipy.org/\n10https://github.com/AthenaEPI/dmipy\nZajac, Menegaz, & Pizzolato\nPage 7 of 14\n\n\nMicroscopic Propagator Imaging\nconsideration applies to NG⟂(where the error distribution is even narrower). However, a low 𝑅2 for NG∥indicates\npoor learning performance in this case, with and improved 𝑅2 for GM and CSF compared to WM.\nFigure 4: Mean absolute SHAP values representing the features importance for the selected trained RF regressor. Results\nwere computed by randomly extracting 10000 samples from each of the WM, GM, and CSF testing datasets. A higher\nvalue indicates a higher importance of the feature.\nWe calculated the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values (Lundberg and Lee, 2017) using the tree explainer\n(Lundberg et al., 2020) on the RF model to obtain a reliable quantification of the importance of the features. More\nconventional measures may be biased when features are correlated (Strobl et al., 2008; Nembrini et al., 2018). Fig. 4\nillustrates the importance of features calculated on a representative subsample (10000 examples) of each testing WM,\nGM, and CSF dataset. The DC components are the most important features. This is expected since the 𝑐00 coefficients\nof the SH expansion are related to spherical mean of the shells and determine most of the kernel signal variability, hence\nof its propagator. Results demonstrate the importance of the ratios, which is modulated by the dataset, the considered\nMPI index, and the zonal degree. Notably, ratios have a particularly prominent importance in the determination of\nNG⟂and in the GM dataset.\nMPI indices were compared with the corresponding MAP-MRI ones (processed with MAPL) on the four healthy\nsubjects of the HCP dataset (Fig. 5). Fig. 6 illustrates the correlation scatter plots of the MPI versus MAP-MRI indices\nfor voxels located in white matter (blue) and for voxels located in the region comprising the corpus callosum (orange).\nFor this region, the plots include the regression lines obtained with linear regression (yellow) and with the robust\nestimator RANSAC (Fischler and Bolles, 1981) (green). In addition, the slope of the RANSAC regression line (𝑚) and\nthe Pearson correlation coefficient (𝑟) are reported.\nThe comparison between MPI indices and those obtained with MAP-MRI on the tested subjects (Fig. 6) reveals\na good correlation for RTOP and RTAP in regions, like the corpus callosum, where we expect the tissue to be\ncomposed of a single bundle of coherently aligned axons. In fact, there, the EAP and the microscopic propagator\nshould share similar properties albeit the latter being additionally insensitive to within-bundle orientation dispersion,\ni.e. microdispersion. MPI’s insensitivity to microdispersion may explain the low correlation slope for RTPP. In fact,\naccording to synthetic results shown in Fig. 3, MPI’s RTPP is robustly estimated therefore we can exclude the estimation\nerror being responsible for the slope. Instead, we may focus on the effect of microdispersion on the EAP’s RTPP as\nZajac, Menegaz, & Pizzolato\nPage 8 of 14\n\n\nMicroscopic Propagator Imaging\nFigure 5: Maps of propagator indices obtained with MAPL implementation of MAP-MRI and with MPI for four subjects\nof the HCP dataset. MAPL’s results were clipped between 0 and the 99th percentile to remove outliers. The color bars’\nupper limits were adjusted by considering the highest of values between MAPL and MPI. In the case of NG∥two different\ncolor bar ranges are used ([0,0.6] for MAPL and [0,0.1] for MPI) to adjust for the markedly different value ranges.\nZajac, Menegaz, & Pizzolato\nPage 9 of 14\n\n\nMicroscopic Propagator Imaging\nFigure 6: Correlation between MAP-MRI (MAPL) and MPI in real subjects ROIs. A white matter mask was created\nby selecting the voxels with a predominant fraction of white matter (the fractions of the tissues were recovered using\nMSMT-CSD) and a fractional anisotropy (FA) above 0.5. Additionally, for each subject, the corpus callosum mask was\nobtained with manual segmentation.\nopposed to MPI. MPI’s return-to-plane probability is approximately proportional to the inverse of the axial diffusivity\nof the axonal compartment (the most abundant) in white matter. While small variations in MPI’s RTPP may occur due to\nslightly changing microstructural properties, we see no reason to expect large variations of it in (healthy) homogeneous\nregions like the corpus callosum. We indeed observe that MPI’s RTPP is more constant compared to that estimated with\nMAP-MRI (Fig. 5). We then suggest that the variability of MAP-MRI’s RTPP estimates may thus reflect the differences\nin microdispersion between the voxels in the ROIs. To corroborate this observation, MPI’s RTPP is lower than MAP-\nMRI’s counterpart which confirms findings according to which, correspondingly, the axial axonal diffusivity obtained\nwith a method that removes microdispersion is higher than what calculated otherwise (Pizzolato et al., 2023). A similar\nconsideration can be made for the perpendicular non-Gaussianity, NG⟂. In the presence of orientation dispersion, the\nestimated EAP-based NG⟂will have non-negligible contributions from the axonal diffusion along axons that are not\nperfectly aligned with the EAP’s principal diffusion direction. This \"washing\" effect would then reduce the effective\nvalue of the EAP-based NG⟂, since axons are expected to display a more marked non-Gaussianity perpendicularly\nto their axes compared to along the direction aligned with (parallel to) them. This phenomenon does not occur, or it\ndoes with a lesser extent, in the case of MPI where we observe larger NG⟂values (last column of Fig. 5). Hence, it\nZajac, Menegaz, & Pizzolato\nPage 10 of 14\n\n\nMicroscopic Propagator Imaging\nshould not surprise that the correlation slopes of MPI versus MAP-MRI indices in Fig. 6 differ from the identity, as this\nis an expected outcome. MPI’s parallel non-Gaussianity NG∥deserves special consideration. Maps in Fig. 5 suggest\na relatively high value in white matter, which may indicate the presence of effects due to tortuous (or generally not\ncylindrical) axonal geometries and/or the presence of cellular somas. However, the amount of parallel non-Gaussianity\nis visibly lower compared to MAP-MRI (note that for MPI the color bar has a lower maximum extent). This is also\nexpected, since part of MAP-MRI’s NG∥can be explained, similarly to the other indices, by orientation dispersion.\nHowever, MPI’s NG∥is the only index which has unsatisfactory 𝑅2 values (see Fig. 3), therefore the corresponding\nmaps cannot be trusted. A reason for the low performance of the parallel non-Gaussianity may be found in the training\ndata for, other than the non-Gaussianity due to the presence of cells of different sizes, no sources of parallel non-\nGaussianity for axons have been simulated. This corresponds to having a training dataset where the axonal contribution\nto NG∥is zero. As a consequence, the synthetic signal features of training examples resembling white matter signals\n(where axons are the main compartment) may likely be mapped to the value of the axonal parallel non-Gaussianity,\nhence to zero. This is not the case of the perpendicular direction (that of NG⟂) where both the ensemble of cells with\ndifferent radii, and the ensemble of cylinders of various diameters induce non-Gaussianity.\n5. Discussion\nThe sets of spherical harmonic coefficients estimated for each PGSE shell are naturally linked to the diffusion\nprocess occurring within the voxel’s tissue microstructure. Under the condition that the signal may actually be obtained\nas the convolution between a signal rotational kernel and an orientation distribution function (ODF), which may be\nthe main limiting assumption of MPI, the ratios between corresponding coefficients of any two shells – as well as the\nratios between corresponding 𝑙-band power spectra – are solely linked to the properties of the kernel itself. In fact,\nthe ratios are independent from the ODF. Although this property reveals useful in estimating axial and radial axonal\ndiffusivities, and radii (even accounting for the presence of somas) when using data at strong diffusion weightings\n(Pizzolato et al., 2023), the ratios do not prevent degeneracy when attempting to estimate the parameters of the relatively\nsimple \"standard\" model of (white matter) diffusion (Reisert et al., 2017) using a multi-shell scheme (even as rich as\nthe HCP data used here). However, the results in this work demonstrate that the ratios are directly sensitive to the\nindices of the kernel’s (microscopic) propagator, when collecting data over multiple shells with diffusion weightings\ndefined in a \"q-space sense\" (where the diffusion time Δ −𝛿∕3 and the pulse duration 𝛿are kept constant). This fact\nopens up the new possibility of performing microscopic propagator imaging (MPI).\nThe majority of microscopic propagator indices were robustly estimated. However, we have observed that parallel\nnon-Gaussianity NG∥is not reliable since it had a low regression performance. We cannot say at this moment whether\nthis is due to an intrinsic low sensitivity of the selected features to that specific index or if this is due to the parallel\nnon-Gaussianity not being simulated for axons in the training dataset, as mentioned previously. Nevertheless, this\nconsideration leads us to believe that more sophisticated synthetic signal generation strategies, for example via Monte\nCarlo simulation, would improve the realism of the MPI indices and likely enable the learning of other features of\nthe microscopic propagator. It is worth mentioning that the presented framework can in principle accommodate the\npresence of exchange between tissue compartments in the simulated kernel signal, although a quantification of it may\nnot be straightforward or even possible with the current 𝑞-space acquisition scheme. A more realistic simulation could\nalso benefit some technical choices in the implementation of MPI. For example, using Monte Carlo simulation, it would\nbe possible to completely bypass the step of fitting MAP-MRI to the simulated kernel signal, since RTOP, RTPP and the\nother indices may be calculated directly from the trajectories of the simulated random walkers. This would additionally\nprovide the benefit of avoiding the tuning of parameters for obtaining the microscopic propagator indices, such as the\nmaximum basis order of MAP-MRI and MAPL’s Laplacian regularization. In our simulations, these parameters had\nan effect on the fitting quality, which also depended on the degree of isotropy, or anisotropy, of the simulated kernel\nsignal. Hence, our choices were based on a trade-off between being able to reconstruct very anisotropic kernels and\nnot having too much overfitting in the case of kernels that were mostly isotropic. In practice, after visual inspection,\nwe adopted a high basis order while at the same time introducing Laplacian regularization. Finally, much like for\nEAP-based methods, 𝑞-space sampling will determine the feasibility and robustness of the estimated MPI indices.\nLikewise, designing an ad hoc sampling would enable additional fine-tuning of MPI performance.\nThe proposed MPI framework enables us to decouple the simulation of the kernel signal, in particular the chosen\nsimulation parameters, from the estimated quantities (indices) thanks to the propagator formalism. Independently\nfrom how the kernel signal is simulated, or from which microscopic propagator indices are obtained, the proposed\nZajac, Menegaz, & Pizzolato\nPage 11 of 14\n\n\nMicroscopic Propagator Imaging\nMPI framework is general and opens new possibilities to quantitatively describe the diffusion process due to the\nmicrostructures without explicit biases due to their mesoscopic directional arrangement within the voxel volume.\nTherefore, MPI brings new complementary information to conventional methods that retrieve the Ensemble Average\nPropagator (EAP). In fact, while EAP methods provide indices whose values change with the ODF, MPI indices are\nODF-invariant and thus relate solely to the microscopic tissue properties such as the volumes, sizes, and shapes of axons\nand cells (and possibly any other relevant microstructures). Consequently, MPI is expected to have a higher diagnostic\nrelevance and a more direct interpretability than EAP methods. For example, longitudinal differences in MPI indices in\nthe same subject could be more specifically linked to a change in tissue integrity or composition rather than a change\nin its orientational organization. At the same time, MPI provides indices that retain quantitative interpretability of\nthe diffusion process. In fact, much like DTI and MAP-MRI, MPI indices can be used to compare differences with\nrespect to healthy normative values. Thus, further work may address the question of the diagnostic sensitivity of MPI\nto various pathological conditions of nervous tissue.\n6. Conclusion\nMicroscopic Propagator Imaging (MPI) brings about a new diffusion MRI methodology to extract quantitative\ninformation about the tissue microstructures while remaining unaffected by their (mesoscopic) orientational organiza-\ntion. This property allows variations in MPI indices to more directly reflect changes in the volumes, sizes, and shapes\nof axons, cellular somas, and potentially other microstructures. This implies that MPI may offer a higher specificity\nfor these types of microstructural changes compared to other quantitative propagator-based methods, like Diffusion\nTensor Imaging and Mean Apparent Propagator MRI, which may translate to a better characterization of the tissue in\nview of diagnostic and prognostic applications.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nTommaso Zajac: Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation, Visualization, Writing – Original Draft.\nGloria Menegaz: Investigation, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – Review & Editing.
