The famous Theorem of Nobile says that a pure dimensional\ncomplex analytic set X is analytically smooth if, and only if, its Nash\ntransformation η: N(X) →X is an analytic isomorphism. This result\nwas proven in 1975 and since then, as far as the author knows, no answer\nhas been given to the real case, even more so when one only asks for\nCk smoothness. In this paper, we prove the real version of the Theorem\nof Nobile asking only Ck smoothness, i.e., we prove that for a pure\ndimensional real analytic set X the following statements are equivalent:\n(1) X is a real analytic (resp. Ck+1,1) submanifold;\n(2) the mapping η: N(X) →X is a real analytic (resp. Ck,1) diﬀeo-\nmorphism;\n(3) the mapping η: N(X) →X is a C∞(resp. Ck,1) diﬀeomorphism;\n(4) X is a C∞(resp. Ck+1,1) submanifold.\nIn this paper, we also prove the bi-Lipschitz version of the Theorem of\nNobile. More precisely, we prove that X is analytically smooth if and\nonly if its Nash transformation η: N(X) →X is a homeomorphism that\nlocally bi-Lipschitz.\n1. Introduction\nGiven a pure d-dimensional K-analytic set X in Kn, N(X) is the closure\nin X × GrK(d, n) of the graph of the Gauss mapping ν : X \\ Sing(X) →\nGrK(d, n) given by ν(x) = TxX, where K is C or R and GrK(d, n) is the\nGrassmannian of d-dimensional K-linear subspaces in Kn. The set N(X) is\ncalled the Nash transformation of X and the projection η: N(X) →X\nis called the Nash mapping of X. Sometimes we also call η: N(X) →X\nthe Nash transformation of X. The notion of Nash transformation trivially\nextends to algebraic varieties over a ﬁeld of arbitrary characteristic.\nAn important problem in the resolution of singularities related to Nash\ntransformations is the following conjecture:\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classiﬁcation. 14B05; 32S50 .\nKey words and phrases. Lipschitz regularity, Nobile’s theorem, Nash Conjecture.\nThe author was partially supported by CNPq-Brazil grant 310438/2021-7. This work\nwas supported by the Serrapilheira Institute (grant number Serra – R-2110-39576).\n1\n\n\n2\nJ. E. SAMPAIO\nConjecture 1. A ﬁnite succession of Nash transformations resolves the\nsingularities of X.\nThis problem was proposed by Nash in a private communication to Hi-\nronaka in the early sixties (cf. [18, p. 412]) and it was also posed by Semple\nin [17]. This is why we call it Nash-Semple’s conjecture.\nIt is not the purpose of this article to discuss this conjecture, but it is\nimportant to say that a relevant partial answer to the above conjecture\nwas given by Spivakovsky in [18]. He showed that in the case of surfaces,\nthe normalised Nash transformations (i.e. Nash transformations followed\nby normalizations) resolve the singularities. Recently, in the preprint [1]\nwas given a very important partial answer to Nash-Semple’s conjecture.\nThe authors in [1] presented counterexamples for this conjecture for any\ndimension d ≥4. Thus, Nash-Semple’s conjecture is only an open problem\nin dimensions 2 and 3. However, there are still several important families\nof analytic sets for which this conjecture is an open problem, for example,\nhypersurfaces in all dimensions d ≥2.\nProbably the most basic and fundamental result related to the Nash trans-\nformation and Nash-Semple’s conjecture is the following result proved by\nNobile [11]:\nTheorem 1.1 (Theorem of Nobile). Let X be a pure r-dimensional ana-\nlytic subset in Cn. Then, X is smooth if and only if η: N(X) →X is an\n(analytic) isomorphism.\nIn fact, the precise statement of the Theorem of Nobile is the following:\nLet k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero (resp. k = C), X\nbe a pure r-dimensional algebraic (resp. analytic) variety over k. Then, X\nis smooth if and only if η: N(X) →X is an isomorphism.\nThe proof in [11] shows that it suﬃces to prove the theorem in the analytic\ncase with k = C, as stated in Theorem 1.1. The proof presented in [11] is\nan analytic proof and systematically used the complex structure. A more\nalgebraic proof of the Theorem of Nobile is due to Teissier [19] (cf. [12]).\nSee more about the Theorem of Nobile in the recent notes [12].\nThe version of Theorem of Nobile in positive characteristic does not work.\nIndeed, it is shown in [11] that for the cusp X : x2 = y3, working in\ncharacteristic two, the Nash mapping η: N(X) →X is an isomorphism,\nalthough, of course, X is singular. Recently, in the article [4] the authors\nshowed that if X is a normal variety of any dimension, η: N(X) →X is an\n\n\nREAL AND BI-LIPSCHITZ VERSIONS OF THE THEOREM OF NOBILE\n3\nisomorphism if and only if X is smooth, even if the base ﬁeld has positive\ncharacteristic. More about the Theorem of Nobile can be found in [12].\nHowever, as far as the author knows, there is no proof for the real version\nof this theorem, even more so when one only asks for Ck smoothness. So, it\nis natural to ask: Does the real version of the Theorem of Nobile hold true?\nAnother natural problem is whether the analytic diﬀeomorphism condi-\ntion of the Nash mapping can be weakened.\nRecall that we have a distance deﬁned in GrR(d, n) as follows: Given two\nlinear subspaces L1 and L2 in GrR(d, n),\nδ(L1, L2)\n=\ndH(S1, S2)\n=\nmax{sup\na∈S1\nd(a, S2), sup\nb∈S2\nd(b, S1)},\nwhere Si = Li ∩Sn−1, i = 1, 2 and d(a, S) = inf{∥a −x∥; x ∈S}.\nIn this paper, we prove that it is enough to ask that the Nash mapping\nis locally bi-Lipschitz.\nTheorem 3.4. Let X ⊂Cn be a pure dimensional complex analytic set.\nThen, X is smooth if and only if η: N(X) →X is a homeomorphism that\nis locally bi-Lipschitz.\nWe also prove a real version of Theorem of Nobile, when one only asks\nfor Ck,1 smoothness. Indeed, we prove the following result:\nTheorem 3.5. Let X ⊂Rn be a pure dimensional real analytic set, and let\nk be a nonnegative integer number. Then, X is a Ck+1,1 submanifold if and\nonly if the mapping η: N(X) →X is a homeomorphism such that η−1 is\nCk,1 smooth.\nConsequently, we also obtain the following real version of Theorem of\nNobile.\nTheorem 3.6. Let X ⊂Rn be a pure dimensional real analytic set. Then\nthe following statements are equivalent:\n(1) X is a real analytic submanifold;\n(2) the mapping η: N(X) →X is a real analytic diﬀeomorphism;\n(3) the mapping η: N(X) →X is a C∞diﬀeomorphism;\n(4) X is a C∞submanifold.\nIn fact, we obtain a stronger result. Here, we present a proof that works\neven in the case of sets that are locally deﬁnable in a polynomially bounded\n\n\n4\nJ. E. SAMPAIO\no-minimal structure under small assumptions. For a subset X ⊂Rn, which is\na d-dimensional set deﬁnable in an o-minimal structure, we say that C3(X)\nand C4(X) coincide linearly, if for any p ∈X such that C4(X, p) is a d-\ndimensional linear subspace, then C3(X, p) = C4(X, p).\nWe prove the following more general result:\nTheorem 3.1. Let X ⊂Rn be a locally closed set that is pure dimensional\nand locally deﬁnable in a polynomially bounded o-minimal structure on R.\nSuppose that C3(X) and C4(X) coincide linearly. Then, for a ﬁxed k ∈N,\nthe mapping η: N(X) →X is a homeomorphism such that η−1 is Ck,1\nsmooth if and only if X is a Ck+1,1 submanifold. Moreover, the mapping\nη: N(X) →X is a C∞diﬀeomorphism if and only if X is a C∞submani-\nfold.\nIn order to know more about o-minimal geometry, see, for instance, [2]\nand [3].\nAcknowledgements.

Preliminaries\nAll the subsets of Rn or Cn considered in the paper are supposed to be\nequipped with the Euclidean distance. When we consider other distances,\nit is clearly emphasised.\n2.1. O-minimal structures.\nDeﬁnition 2.1. A structure on R is a collection S = {Sn}n∈Z>0 where each\nSn is a set of subsets of Rn, satisfying the following axioms:\n1) All algebraic subsets of Rn are in Sn;\n2) For every n, Sn is a Boolean subalgebra of the powerset of Rn;\n3) If A ∈Sm and B ∈Sn, then A × B ∈Sm+n.\n4) If π: Rn+1 →Rn is the projection on the ﬁrst n coordinates and\nA ∈Sn+1, then π(A) ∈Sn.\nAn element of Sn is called deﬁnable in S.\nThe structure S is said o-\nminimal if it satisﬁes the following condition:\n5) The elements of S1 are precisely ﬁnite unions of points and intervals.\nDeﬁnition 2.2. A mapping f : A ⊂Rn →Rm is called deﬁnable in S if\nits graph is an element of Sn+m.\n\n\nREAL AND BI-LIPSCHITZ VERSIONS OF THE THEOREM OF NOBILE\n5\nA structure S is said polynomially bounded if it satisﬁes the following\ncondition:\n6) For every function f : R →R that is deﬁnable in S, there exists a\npositive integer number N such that |f(t)| ≤tN for all suﬃciently\nlarge positive t.\nWe say that a set X ⊂Rn is locally deﬁnable in S if for any x ∈X\nthere is a neighbourhood U ⊂Rn of x such that X ∩U is deﬁnable in S.\nThroughout this paper, we ﬁx a polynomially bounded o-minimal struc-\nture S on R.\nIn the sequel, the adjective deﬁnable denotes deﬁnable in S.\nWe say that a set X ⊂Rn is locally deﬁnable if for any x ∈X there is\na neighbourhood U ⊂Rn of x such that X ∩U is deﬁnable.\nRemark 2.3. If f : [0, ǫ) →R is a continuous and deﬁnable function that\nis not identically zero close to 0, then there is a number α ≥0 and c ̸= 0\nsuch that f(t) = ctα + o(tα), where g(t) = o(tα) means lim\nt→0+\ng(t)\ntα = 0 (see [8,\nProposition]). Thus, we deﬁne the order of f at 0 by ord0f = α.\n2.2. Tangent cones.\nDeﬁnition 2.4. Let X ⊂Rn be a subset and let p ∈X.\nWe say that\nv ∈Rn is a tangent vector of X at p if there are a sequence {xj}j∈N ⊂X\nand a sequence of positive real numbers {tj}j∈N such that lim\nj→∞tj = 0 and\nlim\nj→∞\n1\ntj (xj −p) = v. The set of all tangent vectors of X at p is denoted by\nC3(X, p) and is called the tangent cone of X at p.\nRemark 2.5. Let X ⊂Cn be a complex analytic (resp. algebraic) set and\nx0 ∈X. In this case, C(X, x0) (resp. C(X, ∞)) is the zero set of a set of\ncomplex homogeneous polynomials, as we can see in [20, Theorem 4D]. In\nparticular, C(X, x0) (resp. C(X, ∞)) is the union of complex lines passing\nthrough the origin 0 ∈Cn.\nDeﬁnition 2.6. Given a pure d-dimensional deﬁnable set X ⊂Rn and p ∈\nX, C4(X, p) is the union of the d-dimensional linear subspaces T ⊂Rn such\nthat there is a sequence {xj}j∈N ⊂X \\Sing1(X) satisfying\nlim\nj→+∞TxjX = T,\nwhere Sing1(X) denotes the set of points x ∈X such that X is not a C1\nsubmanifold around x.\nNote that C3(X, p) ⊂C4(X, p) for all p ∈X.\n\n\n6\nJ. E. SAMPAIO\n2.3. Multiplicity and degree of real sets. This subsection is closely\nrelated to the subsection with the same title in [6].\nLet X ⊂Rn be a d-dimensional real analytic set with 0 ∈X and\nXC = V (IR(X, 0)),\nwhere IR(X, 0) is the ideal in C{z1, . . . , zn} generated by the complexiﬁca-\ntions of all germs of real analytic functions that vanish on the germ (X, 0).\nWe know that XC is a germ of a complex analytic set and dimC XC =\ndimR X. Then, for a linear projection π : Cn →Cd such that π−1(0) ∩\nC(XC, 0) = {0}, there exists an open neighbourhood U ⊂Cn of 0 such that\n#(π−1(x) ∩(XC ∩U)) is constant for a generic point x ∈π(U) ⊂Cd. This\nnumber is the multiplicity of XC at the origin and is denoted by m(XC, 0).\nDeﬁnition 2.7. With the above notation, we deﬁne the multiplicity of X at\nthe origin by m(X, 0) := m(XC, 0).\nOne can learn more about multiplicity of real analytic sets in [16].\nRemark 2.8. It follows from the works in [16] and [6] that if X ⊂Rn\nis a pure d-dimensional real analytic set and π: Rn →Rd is a projection\nsuch that π−1(0) ∩C(X, 0) = {0}, then there are an open neighbourhood\nU ⊂Rn of 0 and a subanalytic set σ ⊂Rd such that dimR σ < d and\nm(X, 0) ≡#(π−1(t) ∩U)(mod 2) for all small enough t ∈Rd \\ σ, where\n#(π−1(t) ∩U) denotes the cardinality of π−1(t) ∩U.\n3. Main results\n3.1. Deﬁnable version of the Theorem of Nobile.\nTheorem 3.1. Let X ⊂Rn be a locally closed set that is pure d-dimensional\nand locally deﬁnable in a polynomially bounded o-minimal structure on R.\nSuppose that C3(X) and C4(X) coincide linearly. Then, for a ﬁxed nonneg-\native integer number k, the mapping η: N(X) →X is a homeomorphism\nsuch that η−1 is Ck,1 smooth if and only if X is a Ck+1,1 smooth submani-\nfold. Moreover, the mapping η: N(X) →X is a C∞diﬀeomorphism if and\nonly if X is a C∞submanifold.\nProof. It is clear that if X is a Ck+1,1 smooth submanifold, then η: N(X) →\nX is a homeomorphism such that η−1 is Ck,1. Moreover, if X is a C∞smooth\nsubmanifold, then η: N(X) →X is a C∞smooth diﬀeomorphism.\nReciprocally, assume that the mapping η: N(X) →X is a homeomor-\nphism such that η−1 is Ck,1 smooth.\n\n\nREAL AND BI-LIPSCHITZ VERSIONS OF THE THEOREM OF NOBILE\n7\nFirstly, we assume k = 0. In this case, η: N(X) →X is a homeomor-\nphism that is locally bi-Lipschitz.\nSince η: N(X) →X is in particular a bijection, we obtain that C4(X, p)\nis a d-dimensional linear subspace for all p ∈X. Since C3(X) and C4(X)\ncoincide linearly, then C3(X, p) is a d-dimensional linear subspace for all\np ∈X and continuously varies in p. For simplicity, in this case, for each\np ∈X, we denote C3(X, p) by TpX.\nClaim 1. X is a C1 submanifold.\nProof of Claim 1. Suppose on the contrary that X is not a C1 submanifold.\nBy [7, Theorem 4.4], there exists p ∈X such that there is no neighbourhood\nof p in X to which the restriction to X of the orthogonal πp: Rn →TxX\nis injective.\nWe may assume that p coincides with the origin 0 and we\nchoose the linear coordinates (x, y) of Rn such that TpX = {(x, y); y = 0} =\nRd × {0} ∼= Rd, where k = dim X. With this identiﬁcation, πp now becomes\nthe orthogonal projection to the ﬁrst k coordinates π: Rn →Rd.\nBy [7, Lemma 4.1], there is an open neighbourhood U of 0 in X such\nthat π|U is an open map. By shrinking U, if necessary, we assume that\nπ(U) = Bd(0, r) and for every p ∈U, δ(TpX, T0X) < 1\n2 and, in particular,\nTpX is not orthogonal to T0X. Since X is locally closed, we may assume\nthat r was taken small enough so that X ∩Bn(0, r) ∩X is a compact set\nand π|−1\nU (0) = {0}.\nLet N =\nsup\nx∈Bd(0,r)\n#π|−1\nU (x) and S = {x ∈Bd(0, r) : #π|−1\nU (x) = N},\nwhere #π|−1\nU (x) denotes the cardinality of π|−1\nU (x). By shrinking r, if nec-\nessary, we assume that 0 ∈S. Given x0 ∈S ∩Bd(0, r/2), let t = sup{s ≤\nr/2; #π|−1\nU (x) = N for all x ∈Bd(x0, s)}. We have that S is an open set,\nπ−1\nU (Bd(x0, t)) has exactly N connected components, say X1, ...., XN, and\neach Xi is the graph of a C1 deﬁnable mapping fi : Bd(x0, t) →Rn−d. By\nthe assumptions on the tangent cones, we also have that each fi has bounded\nderivative, and thus it is a Lipschitz mapping and has a Lipschitz extension\n¯fi : Bd(x0, t) →Rn−d. Note that each ¯fi is also a deﬁnable mapping. Thus,\nthere is x ∈Bd(x0, t) such that ∥x −x0∥= t and #π|−1\nU (x) < N. This\nimplies that there are i and j such that ¯fi(x) = ¯fj(x).\nLet λ ≥1 be a number such that ∥Dfi∥≤λ and ∥Dfj∥≤λ on S.\nThere is a constant ˜K such that δ(T(z,fi(z))Xi, T(z,fj(z))Xj) ≥˜K∥(Dfi)z −\n(Dfj)z∥for all z ∈S, where ∥(Dfi)z −(Dfj)z∥:= sup{∥(Dfi)z(u) −\n(Dfj)z(u)∥; u ∈Rd, ∥u∥≤1}.\n\n\n8\nJ. E. SAMPAIO\nIn fact, for a ﬁxed z ∈S, let Si = T(z,fi(z))X ∩Sn−1 and Sj = T(z,fj(z))X ∩\nSn−1. Then, we have\nδ(T(z,fi(z))X, T(z,fj(z))X)\n=\ndH(Si, Sj)\n=\nmax{sup\na∈Si\nd(a, Sj), sup\nb∈Sj\nd(b, Si)},\nand thus for any u ∈Rd \\ {0}, there is v ∈Rd \\ {0} such that\nδ(T(z,fi(z))X, T(z,fj(z))X)\n≥\n\r\r\r\r\n(u, (Dfi)z(u))\n∥(u, (Dfi)z(u))∥−\n(v, (Dfj)z(v))\n∥(v, (Dfj)z(v))∥\n\r\r\r\r .\nDenoting ˜u =\nu\n∥(u,(Dfi)z(u))∥and ˜v =\nv\n∥(v,(Dfj)z(v))∥, we have\nδ(T(z,fi(z))X, T(z,fj(z))X)\n≥\n∥(˜u, (Dfi)z(˜u)) −(˜v, (Dfj)z(˜v))∥\n≥\n√\n2\n2 (∥˜u −˜v∥+ ∥(Dfi)z(˜u) −(Dfj)z(˜v)∥)\n≥\n√\n2\n2 (∥˜u −˜v∥+ 1\nλ∥(Dfi)z(˜u) −(Dfj)z(˜v)∥)\n≥\n√\n2\n2 ∥˜u −˜v∥+\n√\n2\n2λ ∥(Dfi)z(˜u) −(Dfj)z(˜u)∥\n−\n√\n2\n2λ ∥(Dfj)z(˜u −˜v)∥\n≥\n√\n2\n2λ ∥(Dfi)z(˜u) −(Dfj)z(˜u)∥.\nNote that ∥˜u∥≥\n1\n√\n1+λ2. Therefore,\nδ(T(z,fi(z))X, T(z,fj(z))X)\n≥\n√\n2\n2λ\n√\n1 + λ2 ∥(Dfi)z −(Dfj)z∥.\n(1)\nLet γ : [0, ǫ) →Bd(x0, t) be the arc given by γ(t) = x + tu, where u =\nx0−x\n∥x0−x∥. We have γ((0, ǫ)) ⊂Bd(x0, t) and ∥γ′(t)∥= ∥u∥= 1 for all t ∈\n[0, ǫ). Let γi(t) = (γ(t), fi(γ(t))) and γj(t) = (γ(t), fj(γ(t))). For simplicity,\ndenote g(t) = fi ◦γ(t) −fj ◦γ(t).\nBy the inequality 1,\nδ(Tγi(t)X, Tγj(t)X) ≥\n√\n2\n2λ\n√\n1 + λ2 ∥(Dfi)γ(t)(γ′(t)) −(Dfj)γ(t)(γ′(t))∥\nfor all t ∈(0, ǫ).

Therefore X is a C1 submanifold.\n□\nClaim 2. X is a C1,1 submanifold.\nProof of Claim 2. This follows by using the Pl¨ucker embedding, but we\npresent a direct proof here.\nSince we are dealing with a local problem, we may assume that X is the\ngraph of a C1 mapping f : Bd(0, r) →Rn−d, for some r > 0. By shrinking\nr > 0, if necessary, we may assume that f is λ-Lipschitz. We assume that\nλ ≥1. Then, for S1 = T(z,f(z))X ∩Sn−1 and S2 = T(w,f(w))X ∩Sn−1, we\nhave\nδ(T(z,f(z))X, T(w,f(w))X)\n=\ndH(S1, S2)\n=\nmax{sup\na∈S1\nd(a, S2), sup\nb∈S2\nd(b, S1)},\nand thus for any u ∈Rd \\ {0}, there is v ∈Rd \\ {0} such that\nδ(T(z,f(z))X, T(w,f(w))X)\n≥\n\r\r\r\r\n(u, Dfz(u))\n∥(u, Dfz(u))∥−\n(v, Dfw(v))\n∥(v, Dfw(v))∥\n\r\r\r\r .\nDenoting ˜u =\nu\n∥(u,Dfz(u))∥and ˜v =\nv\n∥(v,Dfw(v))∥, we have\nδ(T(z,f(z))X, T(w,f(w))X)\n≥\n∥(˜u, Dfz(˜u)) −(˜v, Dfw(˜v))∥\n≥\n√\n2\n2 (∥˜u −˜v∥+ ∥Dfz(˜u) −Dfw(˜v)∥)\n≥\n√\n2\n2 (∥˜u −˜v∥+ 1\nλ∥Dfz(˜u) −Dfw(˜v)∥)\n≥\n√\n2\n2 (∥˜u −˜v∥+ 1\nλ(∥Dfz(˜u) −Dfw(˜u)∥−∥Dfw(˜u −˜v)∥))\n≥\n√\n2\n2λ ∥Dfz(˜u) −Dfw(˜u)∥.\nNote that ∥˜u∥≥\n1\n√\n1+λ2. Therefore,\nδ(T(z,f(z))X, T(w,f(w))X)\n≥\n√\n2\n2λ\n√\n1 + λ2 ∥Dfz −Dfw∥,\n\n\n10\nJ. E. SAMPAIO\nwhere ∥Dfz −Dfw∥= sup{∥Dfz(u) −Dfw(u)∥; u ∈Rd, ∥u∥≤1}.\nBy\nhypothesis, there is a constant K > 0 such that δ(T(z,f(z))X, T(w,f(w))X) ≤\nK∥(z, f(z)) −(w, f(w))∥. Then,\n∥Dfz −Dfw∥\n≤\nKλ\np\n2 + 2λ2∥(z, f(z)) −(w, f(w))∥\n≤\nKλ\np\n2 + 2λ2(∥z −w∥+ ∥f(z) −f(w)∥)\n≤\nKλ\np\n2 + 2λ2(1 + λ)∥z −w∥.\nTherefore, Df is Lipschitz, which shows that X is a C1,1 submanifold.\n□\nNow, we assume that k ≥1. By the ﬁrst part of this proof, X is C1,1\nsmooth.\nSince our problem is a local problem, we may assume that X is the graph\nof a C1,1 smooth mapping h: B →Rn−d and such that h is a deﬁnable\nmapping. Let us write h = (h1, ..., hd).\nWe are going to show that h is Ck+1,1. This follows from the following\nclaim:\nClaim 3. If h is Cs,1 smooth for some 1 ≤s ≤k, then h is Cs+1,1 smooth.\nProof of Claim 3. Assume that h is Cs,1 smooth for some 1 ≤s ≤k.\nThen X is a Cs,1 submanifold.\nSince η: N(X) →X is a Ck,1 smooth\ndiﬀeomorphism and k ≥s, then N(X) is a Cs,1 submanifold as well, and\nthus ν : X →GrR(d, n) is Cs,1 smooth. By using the Pl¨ucker embedding\np: GrR(d, n) →P(Vd Rn), where Vd Rn is the d-th exterior power of Rn and\nP(Vd Rn) is the projectivization of Vd Rn, we see that 1 and each partial\nderivative ∂hi\n∂xj are coordinates of (id × p) ◦η−1(x, h(x)), and thus ∂hi\n∂xj is Cs,1\nsmooth. Therefore, h is Cs+1,1 smooth.\n□\nSince h is C1,1 smooth, by using recursively Claim 3, h is Ck+1,1 smooth.\nMoreover, if η: N(X) →X is a C∞diﬀeomorphism, then by Claim 3, h\nis Ck,1 smooth for all positive integer k. Therefore, h is C∞smooth, and\nthus X is a C∞submanifold.\n□\nExample 3.2. Let X = {(x, y) ∈C2; x2 = y3}. We have that η: N(X) →\nX is a bi-α-H¨older homeomorphism for some α ∈(0, 1). However, X is not\na C1 submanifold.\nExample 3.3. Let X = {(x, y) ∈R2; y ≥0}. We have that η: N(X) →X\nis a C∞diﬀeomorphism. Indeed, η−1(x) = (x, R2) for all x ∈X. However,\nX is not a C1 submanifold.\n\n\nREAL AND BI-LIPSCHITZ VERSIONS OF THE THEOREM OF NOBILE\n11\n3.2. Metric version of the Theorem of Nobile.\nTheorem 3.4.

By Theorem 3.1, X is a C1,1 submanifold. By a result\nproved by Milnor in the introduction of [9], X is smooth. This also follows\nfrom the Lipschitz Regularity Theorem [15, Theorem 4.2] (see also [14]).\n□\nNote that the condition that η: N(X) →X is locally bi-Lipschitz cannot\nbe dropped. Indeed, if X = {(x, y) ∈C2; x2 = y3}, then η: N(X) →X is a\nhomeomorphism, but X is not smooth at 0.\n3.3. Real version of the Theorem of Nobile.\nTheorem 3.5. Let X ⊂Rn be a pure d-dimensional real analytic set, and\nlet k be a nonnegative integer number. Then X is a Ck+1,1 submanifold if,\nand only if, the mapping η: N(X) →X is a homeomorphism such that η−1\nis Ck,1 smooth.\nProof. It is clear that if X is a Ck+1,1 submanifold, then η: N(X) →X is\na homeomorphism such that η−1 is Ck,1 smooth.\nReciprocally, assume that η: N(X) →X is a homeomorphism such that\nη−1 is Ck,1 smooth.\nSince η: N(X) →X is in particular a bijection, we obtain that C4(X, p)\nis a d-dimensional linear subspace for all p ∈X. In particular, C4(X, p)\ncontinuously varies on p.\nWe are going to prove that C3(X, p) = C4(X, p) for all p ∈X. Suppose\nby contradiction that this is not true, that is, suppose that there is p ∈X\nsuch that C3(X, p) ⊊C4(X, p). Then W := int(C4(X, p) \\ C3(X, p)) is not\nan empty cone.\nWe may assume that p = 0 and we choose linear coordinates (x, y) in Rn\nsuch that C4(X, 0) = {(x, y) ∈Rn; y = 0}. Let π: Rn →C4(X, 0) ∼= Rd be\nthe orthogonal projection. Since X is a real analytic set, the multiplicity\nmod 2 is well-deﬁned. Let U be a suﬃciently small neighbourhood of 0 in\nX such that there is a subanalytic set σ ⊂C4(X, 0) such that #(π−1(v) ∩\nU) (mod 2) is constant for all suﬃciently small v ∈C4(X, 0) \\ σ.\n\n\n12\nJ. E. SAMPAIO\nFor v ∈W and a suﬃciently small neighbourhood U of 0 in X, we have\nthat π−1(tv)∩U = ∅for all suﬃciently small t > 0. This shows that the mul-\ntiplicity of X at the origin is 0 (mod 2). Since C4(X, q) continuously varies on\nq, by shrinking U, if necessary, we may assume that δ(C4(X, 0), C4(X, q)) <\n1/3 for all q ∈U. In particular, for each q ∈U, the restriction of π to\nC4(X, q) is a linear isomorphism.\nTherefore, π(U \\ Sing(X)) is an open\nsubset of C4(X, 0). We may assume that U = X ∩Bn(0, r) for some r > 0.\nLet B = π(U), B′ = B\\π(Sing(X)), U ′ = π−1(B′)∩U, N = sup\nx∈B′ #π|−1\nU′ (x)\nand S = {x ∈B′ : #π|−1\nU (x) = N}. By shrinking r, if necessary, we assume\nthat 0 ∈S and π−1(0) ∩U = {0}. We have that S is an open set, π−1\nU (S)\nhas exactly N connected components, say X1, ...., XN, and for each i, Xi\nis the graph of a C1 mapping fi: S →Rn−d. By the assumptions on the\ntangent cones, we also have that each fi has bounded derivative. Let λ ≥1\nbe a number such that ∥Dfi∥≤λ in S for all i ∈{1, ..., N}.\nSince 0 ∈S, there is a deﬁnable C1 smooth arc γ : [0, ǫ) →S such that\nγ(0) = x, γ((0, ǫ)) ⊂S and ∥γ(t)∥= t for all t ∈[0, ǫ).\nLet ˜γi(t) =\n(γ(t), fi(γ(t))) and ˜γj(t) = (γ(t), fj(γ(t))).\nSince m(X, 0) = 0 (mod 2), we have N ≥2 and, in particular, π|U is not\ninjective.\nBy proceeding as in the proof of Theorem 3.1, there is a constant ˜K such\nthat δ(T(z,fi(z))Xi, T(z,fj(z))Xj) ≥˜K∥(Dfi)z −(Dfj)z∥for all z ∈S. Then,\nδ(Tγi(t)Xi, Tγj(t)Xj) ≥˜K∥(fi ◦γ)′(t) −(fj ◦γ)′(t)∥for all t ∈[0, ǫ).\nSince η is, in particular, a local bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism, by proceed-\ning in the same way as in the proof of Theorem 3.1, we obtain\nord0∥γi(t) −γj(t)∥\n≤\nord0∥γi(t) −γj(t)∥−1,\nwhich is a contradiction.\nTherefore, C3(X, p) = C4(X, p) for all p ∈X.\nIn particular, C3(X) and C4(X) coincide linearly. By Theorem 3.1, X is a\nCk+1,1 submanifold.\n□\nConsequently, we obtain the following real version of the Theorem of\nNobile.\nTheorem 3.6. Let X ⊂Rn be a pure d-dimensional real analytic set. Then\nthe following statements are equivalent:\n(1) X is a real analytic submanifold;\n(2) the mapping η: N(X) →X is a real analytic diﬀeomorphism;\n(3) the mapping η: N(X) →X is a C∞diﬀeomorphism;\n\n\nREAL AND BI-LIPSCHITZ VERSIONS OF THE THEOREM OF NOBILE\n13\n(4) X is a C∞submanifold.\nProof. It is clear that (1) ⇒(2) and (2) ⇒(3).\nLet us prove (3) ⇒(4). So, assume that η: N(X) →X is a C∞diﬀeo-\nmorphism. In particular, η−1 is Ck,1 smooth for any nonnegative integer k.\nBy Theorem 3.5 and the proof of Theorem 3.1, X is locally the graph of a\nmapping a h: B →Rn−d that is Ck+1,1 smooth for all nonnegative integer\nk. So, h is smooth C∞and, therefore, X is a C∞submanifold.\nThe implication (4) ⇒(1) follows from [5, Proposition 1.1].\n□\nReferences\n[1] Castillo, F.; Duarte, D.; Leyton-´Alvarez, M. and Liendo, A.
