It was known\nthat string theory admits enormous vacua in the context of flux compactifications. Among\nthose, the vacua arising from flux compactifications in type IIB string theory are referred\nto as type IIB flux vacua (for reviews, see [1–3]). Since this landscape serves as one of the\ncontrollable low-energy effective theories derived from string theory, it has been extensively\ninvestigated from both theoretical and phenomenological perspectives.\n– 1 –\n\n\nModular symmetry in low-energy effective theories provides a powerful tool for clari-\nfying the vacuum structure within the flux landscape. In type IIB flux compactifications\non T 6/(Z2 × Z′\n2) orientifolds, the modular symmetry leads to a classification of Vacuum\nExpectation Values (VEVs) regarding complex structure moduli fields as physically inde-\npendent vacua. Then, the distribution of the VEVs was known to be clustered at fixed\npoints of PSL(2, Z) modular symmetry [4, 5]. In addition, although the modular symme-\ntry appearing in the landscape concerning T 6/Z6−II orientifold is not PSL(2, Z) but ¯Γ0(3)\nwhich is the subgroup of PSL(2, Z), it was found that the distribution of the VEVs is\nclustered at the fixed points of ¯Γ0(3) modular symmetry [6]. Thus, we can state that the\nflux landscape favors the fixed points of the modular symmetry. From a phenomenological\nperspective, the fixed points of the modular symmetry are known to exhibit remarkably\ninteresting features [7–18]. Therefore, it is very important to systematically classify the\nmodular symmetries in low-energy effective theories to reveal the vacuum structure of the\nflux landscape in different toroidal orientifolds.\nConsidering the systematic classification of the modular symmetries, it is useful to\ndiscuss the symmetries through the symplectic basis transformation of the period vector.\nHowever, the methods mentioned in previous research [6] are not enough to systematically\nclassify the modular symmetries of the period vector in various toroidal orbifolds because\nwe can not determine cycles of a third-cohomology basis on the toroidal orbifolds. Since\nthe linear combinations of these cycles lead to different cycles with different modular sym-\nmetries, we discuss the resolution of the indefiniteness of the cycles by choosing the period\nvector including the structure of “Scaling duality” which is a natural generalization of S-\ntransformation of PSL(2, Z). In addition, we must consider the degree of freedom regarding\noverall factors of the cycles of the third-cohomology basis. Since these factors affect the\nintersection numbers and the relative sizes between the components of the period vector,\nthe indefiniteness of the overall factor causes the emergence of various modular symmetries.\nThen, by assuming the consistency of duality symmetries for a complex-structure modulus\non each toroidal orbifold in the context of low-energy effective action of string theory, we\ncan fix the overall factors of cycles. In heterotic string theory, the duality symmetries of\nthe complex-structure modulus are derived from threshold corrections of moduli-dependent\ngauge coupling constants [19, 20]. These previous researches have classified the duality\nsymmetries by investigating the dependence of winding and momentum modes. Therefore,\nsince the structure of the winding and the momentum modes regarding the massive mode\nin the ten-dimensional bosonic string sector of the type IIB closed string is the same as the\ncase of the heterotic string theory, we can classify the duality symmetries of the complex-\nstructure modulus by applying the same technology to the one-loop partition function of\nthe type IIB closed string. Under this assumption, the systematic classification of the mod-\nular symmetries can be performed in the type IIB flux landscape of the various toroidal\norientifolds.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we briefly review the geometry of\nT 6/Z4 orbifold with SU(2) × SU(4) × SO(5) root lattice. First, we construct the cycles of\nthe third cohomology basis which is invariant under the Coxeter element Q, and investigate\n– 2 –\n\n\nthese intersection numbers. Next, we calculate complex one-forms by taking account of\neigenvectors concerning the Coxeter element to obtain a holomorphic three-form. In section\n3, the construction of the period vector is discussed to study the modular transformation of\nit. To include the contribution of the intersection numbers which are not normalized to one,\nwe revisit the definition of the coordinates and the derivatives of a prepotential. Moreover,\nwe show the “Scaling duality” appearing in the symplectic transformation group Sp(4, Z).\nIn addition, we summarize the duality symmetries on the toroidal orbifolds and mention\nthe conditions for the period vector, which are necessary to classify the modular symmetries\nsystematically. In section 4, by taking account of effective potentials induced by three-form\nfluxes on the toroidal orientifolds, we obtain supersymmetric (SUSY) Minkowski solutions\nby solving F-term equations. Then, to check the invariance of the F-term equations and the\nscalar potential under the modular transformations, we discuss the relevant transformations\nof the three-form fluxes.\nConsidering these flux transformations, we can deal with the\nexplicit modular symmetries in the low-energy effective theory on each toroidal orientifold.\nSection 5 is devoted to the conclusion. In Appendix A, we discuss the details of the duality\nsymmetries derived from the structure of the winding and the momentum numbers regarding\nthe mass spectrum of the type IIB closed string. In Appendix B, we summarize the explicit\nexamples regarding the period vectors and the three-form fluxes on the various orientifolds.\n2\nThe geometry of orbifold\nIn the following, taking an explicit orbifold into account, we discuss the breakdown of the\nSL(2, Z) symmetry for complex-structure moduli derived from the geometry of orbifolds\nwith h2,1\nuntw. = 1. First, we perform SL(2, Z) modular transformation of a period vector that\nappears in the effective action of type IIB string theory. In particular, in this section, we\nfocus on the T 6/Z4 orbifold with the SU(2) × SU(4) × SO(5) root lattice.\n2.1\nGeometry\nThe torus lattices for orbifold constructions and orbifold geometrical properties have been\nstudied in [21–24]. In particular, the geometry of toroidal orbifolds utilized in flux com-\npactifications of type IIB theory had been studied in [25–27], we briefly review them to\nfacilitate later discussion.\nFirst, we discuss the geometry of the T 6/Z4 orientifold with the SU(2)×SU(4)×SO(5)\nroot lattice. The Hodge numbers for the untwisted sector are (h1,1\nuntw., h2,1\nuntw.) = (5, 1) and\nthe Hodge numbers for the twisted sector are (h1,1\ntwist., h2,1\ntwist.) = (22, 2). In this study, we\nfocus exclusively on the untwisted sector of the complex-structure modulus and analyze the\nmodular transformations that act on it.\nTo construct some orbifolds, we impose the boundary conditions on a basis of T 6. When\nconsidering the T 6/Z4 orbifold, it is required that the six-dimensional metric is invariant\nunder the action of Z4. By using Coxeter element Q corresponding to SU(2)×SU(4)×SO(5)\nroot lattice, we can define Z4 basis transformation for the metric described by gij = ⟨ei, ej⟩.\n– 3 –\n\n\nThe action of Q on SU(2) × SU(4) × SO(5) root lattice is defined as\nQ(e1) = e2,\nQ(e2) = e1 + e2 + e3 + e4,\nQ(e3) = −e1 −e2 −e3,\nQ(e4) = −e1 −e2 −e4,\nQ(e5) = e6,\nQ(e6) = −e5 −e6.\n(2.1)\nThe matrix representation of Q is defined by Q(ei) = ejQji, and the explicit matrix is\nshown below:\nQ =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 0 −1 0 0\n0\n1 0 −1 0 0\n0\n0 1 −1 0 0\n0\n0 0 0 1 −1 0\n0 0 0 2 −1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 −1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,\n(2.2)\nwhere Q4 = 1. From the invariance of the metric, i.e., QtgQ = g, and the relation between\nthe metric and the 1-forms dxi, i.e., ds2 = gijdxi ⊗dxj, the 1-forms transform into dx′ =\nQdx.\nIn the case of T 6, there are 20 real three-forms defined by a third-cohomology basis as\nfollows:\nα0 = dx1 ∧dx3 ∧dx5,\nβ0 = dx2 ∧dx4 ∧dx6,\nα1 = dx2 ∧dx3 ∧dx5,\nβ1 = −dx1 ∧dx4 ∧dx6,\nα2 = dx1 ∧dx4 ∧dx5,\nβ2 = −dx2 ∧dx3 ∧dx6,\nα3 = dx1 ∧dx3 ∧dx6,\nβ3 = −dx2 ∧dx4 ∧dx5,\nγ1 = dx1 ∧dx2 ∧dx3,\nδ1 = −dx4 ∧dx5 ∧dx6,\nγ2 = dx1 ∧dx2 ∧dx5,\nδ2 = −dx3 ∧dx4 ∧dx6,\nγ3 = dx1 ∧dx3 ∧dx4,\nδ3 = −dx2 ∧dx5 ∧dx6,\nγ4 = dx3 ∧dx4 ∧dx5,\nδ4 = −dx1 ∧dx2 ∧dx6,\nγ5 = dx1 ∧dx5 ∧dx6,\nδ5 = −dx2 ∧dx3 ∧dx4,\nγ6 = dx3 ∧dx5 ∧dx6,\nδ6 = −dx1 ∧dx2 ∧dx4,\n(2.3)\nwhere the six real coordinates xi on the torus T 6 have the periodic boundary conditions\ni.e. xi ∼= xi + 1 and the orientation is\nR\nT 6/Z4 dx1 ∧dx2 ∧dx3 ∧dx4 ∧dx5 ∧dx6 = −1. Then,\nthe above cycles satisfy\nZ\nT 6/Z4\nαi ∧βj = δi\nj,\nZ\nT 6/Z4\nγi ∧δj = δi\nj.\n(2.4)\nNote that the basis composed by these cycles is not the basis on T 6/Z4 but the basis on\nT 6 owe to lack of invariance for the Coxeter element and we just choose the normalization\nof intersection number regarding these cycles on T 6/Z4.\n– 4 –\n\n\nWhen discussing the geometry of orbifolds, it is necessary to prepare the real three-\nforms that are invariant under the Coxeter element Q [6]. For example, by using a real\nthree-form α0 and the definition of Q4 = 1, we can obtain a new basis which is invariant\nunder Q as follows:\nX\nΓ(α0) := Q(α0) + Q2(α0) + Q3(α0) + Q4(α0)\n= 2α0 −2α1 −2δ5 + 2δ6,\n(2.5)\nwhere we denote an orbit Γ of α0 under a transformation group G by G(α0) ≡{gα0 | g ∈G}\nand we consider the summation of each orbit regarding α0. Q is one of the elements in\nG and the length of orbits regarding α0 is 4 due to Q4(α0) = α0. Then, following the\ntransformation: dx′ = Qdx, we arrive at\nQ(α0) = Q(dx1 ∧dx3 ∧dx5)\n= (−dx3) ∧(dx2 −dx3) ∧(2 dx4 −dx5)\n= −α1 −2δ5.\n(2.6)\nTo construct the cycles on the orbifold, we apply this action P Γ to 20 real three-forms.\nBy choosing only the linearly independent cycles from the obtained invariant cycles, the\nfollowing four cycles are derived 1;\n1A0 ≡1\n2\nX\nΓ(α1),\n1A1 ≡\nX\nΓ(β1),\n1B0 ≡\nX\nΓ(δ2),\n1B1 ≡\nX\nΓ(α0),\n(2.7)\nwhich is invariant third-cohomology basis H3(T 6/Z4, Z) under the Coxeter element Q. Here,\nwe also consider the sum of orbits associated with the Coxeter element and the lengths of\nfour orbits are\n|Γ(α0)| = 4,\n|Γ(α1)| = 4,\n|Γ(β1)| = 4,\n|Γ(δ2)| = 4.\n(2.8)\nIn terms of 20 real three-forms, the basis can be expressed as follows:\n1A0 = α0 −γ2 −2γ3 −δ5 −δ6,\n1A1 = −2β0 −γ5 + γ6 −δ3,\n1B0 = 2β1 + γ5 −γ6 −2δ2 −δ3,\n1B1 = 2(α0 −α1 −δ5 + δ6).\n(2.9)\nOn T 6, these intersections of the dual cycles in regard to the orbifold satisfy the following\nrelations:\nZ\nT 6/Z4\n1A0 ∧1B0 = 4,\nZ\nT 6/Z4\n1A1 ∧1B1 = 8,\n(2.10)\n1Here, we can not fix the explicit basis by using the Coxeter element and intersection numbers. In a\nlater discussion, we choose the explicit form by modular symmetries originating from string theory.\n– 5 –\n\n\nwhere the other intersection numbers are 0. In section 3.3, the difference of these intersection\nnumbers is an important factor to obtain the modular transformation of the period vector,\nwhich is consistent with duality symmetries.\n2.2\nHolomorphic three-form\nFor the construction of period vector which has the dependence of a complex-structure\nmodulus, it is necessary to get the explicit expression of the holomorphic three-form. A\nholomorphic three-form is defined as the wedge product of complex one-form {dzi}i=1,2,3\nwhere the Coxeter element acts diagonally on these one-forms;\nQ :\ndzi →e2πξidzi,\n(2.11)\nwith the eigenvalues 2πξi. Then, in order to find the complex one-form, we require the\nfollowing ansatz:\n\n\n\ndz1\ndz2\ndz3\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n(v1)tdx\n(v2)tdx\n(v3)tdx\n\n\n,\n(2.12)\nwhere vi are the eigenvectors of the Coxeter element Qt with the eigenvalues (e2πξ1, e2πξ2, e2πξ3)\nand the requirement of SU(3)-holonomy leads to ±ξ1 ± ξ2 ± ξ3 = 0. Here, we choose the\neigenvalues (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) =\n\u0000 1\n4, 1\n4, −2\n4\n\u0001\n. In Eq. (2.12), the action of the Coxeter element can\nbe represented as\nQ(dzi) = (vi)tdx′ = (Qtvi)tdx = e2πξidzi.\n(2.13)\nFrom the above discussion, we can construct the complex one-forms as follows:\ndz1 = a\n\u0000dx1 + i dx2 −dx3\u0001\n,\ndz2 = b\n\u0012\ndx4 −\n\u00121\n2 −i\n2\n\u0013\ndx5\n\u0013\n,\ndz3 = c\n\u0000dx1 −dx2 + dx3\u0001\n+ d dx6,\n(2.14)\nwhere a, b, c and d are constants.\nIn the case of T 6/Z4, the volume of the fixed sub-torus regarding higher twists is larger\nthan one [27].\nBy requiring the normalized periodicity for the sub-tori, we choose the\nnormalization of Eq. (2.14) such that |detY | = 2ImU, where Y is the transformation from\nreal to complex coordinates.\nSince the direction of the fixed torus is derived from the invariance of the self-dual\nlattice [28], we can describe the fixed torus by the winding number w and momenta number\np satisfying Q2w = w and ((Qt)−1)2p = p (see Appendix A);\nw =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn1\n0\nn1\n0\n0\nn2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,\np =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nm1\n−m1\nm1\n0\n0\nm2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,\n(2.15)\n– 6 –\n\n\nwhere {n1, n2, m1, m2} are integers. The inner product of winding and momentum numbers\nis\nptw = 2n1m1 + n2m2.\n(2.16)\nThen, the coefficient of n1m1, which is not one, implies that the real coordinate has a larger\nperiodicity than one, and we consider a normalization to obtain the desirable periodicity in\nthe following. Here, we apply Eq. (2.16) to the eigenvectors of Eq. (2.14);\n(v1)tw = 0,\n(v2)tw = 0,\n(v3)tw = 2c n1 + d n2.\n(2.17)\nFrom this observation, we find that the fixed torus lies along the direction of dz3 and we\nchoose the normalization as c = 1\n2. Finally, by interpreting the remaining complex degrees\nof freedom as the complex-structure modulus and considering |detY | = 2ImU, we can fix\nthe complex one-forms as follows:\ndz1 =\n1\n√\n2\n\u0000dx1 + i dx2 −dx3\u0001\n,\ndz2 = dx4 −\n\u00121\n2 −i\n2\n\u0013\ndx5,\ndz3 = 1\n2\n\u0000dx1 −dx2 + dx3\u0001\n+ Udx6.\n(2.18)\nConsequently, by using these complex one-forms, the holomorphic three-form is defined as\nΩ= dz1 ∧dz2 ∧dz3 where\nR\nT 6/Z4 Ω∧¯Ω= 2iImU.\nIn the following section, we discuss the period vector which can be constructed by\nusing the technique in [6] and the basis transformation of the period vector is known to\nbe associated with the subgroup of PSL(2, Z). However, the explicit form of the period\nvector is not fixed uniquely due to the indefiniteness of the third-cohomology basis on each\norbifold. In addition, it is found that the subgroup with respect to the transformation of\nthe period vector changes when each component of the period vector changes. Note that\nthe complex one-forms are uniquely defined by taking account of |detY | = 2ImU and the\nstructure of the winding and the momentum numbers derived from the mass spectrum of\nthe type IIB closed string, as discussed before. Given this fact, the modular symmetry of\nthe period vector should be fixed uniquely because the duality symmetry for the complex-\nstructure modulus on each toroidal orbifold is fixed uniquely.\nThus, it is strange that\nthe modular transformation of the complex-structure modulus, which is derived from the\nbasis transformation of the period vector, changes depending on how the third-cohomology\nbasis is chosen. To resolve this problem, we examine the consistency between the modular\nsymmetry of the period vector and the duality symmetries in what follows.\n3\nThe modular transformation of period vector\nIn this section, we discuss the construction of the period vector and the modular transfor-\nmation. As mentioned in section 2.1, the explicit real basis, which is invariant under the\n– 7 –\n\n\nCoxeter element Q, can not be fixed and this result leads varieties of the modular transfor-\nmation group regarding the period vector. Our research takes account of determining the\nreal basis by choosing one which is consistent with duality symmetries.\n3.1\nConstruction of period vector\nTo analyze the modular transformation of the complex-structure modulus, we focus on the\nperiod vector on T 6/Z4 orbifold which is defined by the SU(2)×SU(4)×SO(5) root lattice.\nFirstly, we introduce a basis of three cycles AI, BJ with I, J = 0, ..., h2,1\nuntw. on T 6/Z4\norbifold on general grounds 2. Then their intersection numbers are chosen as follows:\nAI ∩BJ = cIδI\nJ,\nBJ ∩AI = −cIδI\nJ,\nAI ∩AI = 0,\nBJ ∩BJ = 0,\n(cI ∈N). (3.1)\nNote that we consider that these intersection numbers are not one. The dual cohomology\nbasis is expressed by (1AI, 1BJ);\nZ\nAJ 1AI =\nZ\nT 6/Z4\n1AI ∧1BJ = cIδI\nJ,\nZ\nBJ\n1BI =\nZ\nT 6/Z4\n1BI ∧1AJ = −cJδJ\nI .\n(3.2)\nWhen the basis transformation preserves these properties, the group of transformation is\ndescribed by a symplectic modular group Sp(2h2,1\nuntw. + 2, Z) [29, 30]. Taking account of\nthe definition of coordinates XI on the moduli space using 1AI periods of holomorphic\nthree-form and functions FI using 1BI periods of holomorphic three-form, it is necessary to\nsatisfy\nR\nT 6/Z4 Ω∧¯Ω= 2iImU. In other words, we must consider the normalization of the\nholomorphic three-form on each cycle. Thus, the coordinates XI and the functions FI are\ndefined as follows 3:\nXI =\n1\n√cI\nZ\nAI Ω,\nFI =\n1\n√cI\nZ\nBI\nΩ,\n(I = 0, ..., h2,1\nuntw.).\n(3.3)\nIn the case of T 6/Z4 orbifold, by using this definition, the holomorphic three-form can\nbe expanded as\nΩ= 1\n2X01A0 +\n1\n2\n√\n2X11A1 −1\n2F01B0 −\n1\n2\n√\n2F11B1.\n(3.4)\nApplying this expansion Eq. (3.4) to\nR\nT 6/Z4 Ω∧¯Ω, we can obtain an explicit expression of\nthe period vector Π:\nZ\nT 6/Z4\nΩ∧¯Ω= −X0 ¯F0 −X1 ¯F1 + ¯X0F0 + ¯X1F1\n= Π†ΣΠ,\n(3.5)\n2Here, these cycles are invariant under the Coxeter element Q and we discuss only the untwisted modulus.\n3Relaxing the normalization for the intersection number ensures that the subsequent discussion demon-\nstrates consistency between the string theory’s duality symmetries and the period vector’s modular sym-\nmetry.\n– 8 –\n\n\nwhere\nΣ =\n \n0\n12\n−12 0\n!\n.\n(3.6)\nTherefore, we arrive at the following expression of the period vector\nΠ ≡\n\n\n\n\n\nX0\nX1\nF0\nF1\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\nR\nT 6/Z4 Ω∧1B0\n1\n2\n√\n2\nR\nT 6/Z4 Ω∧1B1\n1\n2\nR\nT 6/Z4 Ω∧1A0\n1\n2\n√\n2\nR\nT 6/Z4 Ω∧1A1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n√\n2\n−iU\nU\n√\n2\ni\n2\n\n\n\n\n,\n(3.7)\nwhich satisfies Π†ΣΠ = 2iImU. Since the overall factor can be absorbed by Käler transfor-\nmation, we consider a modified period vector Π′ =\n\u0010\n1, −i\n√\n2U, U,\ni\n√\n2\n\u0011t\nin the discussion of\nmodular transformation.\n3.2\nModular transformation of period vector\nFrom the properties of Eq. (3.2), we know that the basis transformation of the period\nvector is Sp(4, Z). However, in general, we do not know how the symplectic transformation\ncan be interpreted as a modular transformation of the complex-structure modulus in the\nperiod vector.4 In the following discussion, we take account of the modular transformation\ngroup regarding the period vector by a linear fractional transformation as follows:\nU →aU + b\ncU + d,\n(3.8)\nwhere a, b, c and d are integer coefficients. Then, we require a condition ad −bc ̸= 0 5.\nFrom the properties of Eq.\n(3.2), we know that the basis transformation group of the\nperiod vector is Sp(4, Z).\nTherefore, it is necessary to find constraints of a, b, c and d\nby making an association between the linear fractional transformation and the symplectic\nmodular transformation. The following discussion is based on [6].\nFirst, regarding the period vector Π′ =\n\u0010\n1, −i\n√\n2U, U,\ni\n√\n2\n\u0011t\n, we identify a relation\nbetween the linear fractional transformation with Kähler transformation (cU + d) and the\nsymplectic modular transformation. Considering the transformation (3.8) for Π′, we can\nobtain the following vector\n\n\n\n\n\ncU + d\n−i\n√\n2(aU + b)\naU + b\ni\n√\n2(cU + d)\n\n\n\n\n,\n(3.9)\n4The relation between the modular transformation and symplectic transformation of the complex struc-\nture or Kähler structure moduli in specific Calabi-Yau threefolds was discussed in [31].\n5In general, a, b, c and d are not integers. However, in this research, we treat them as integers to simplify\nour discussions.\n– 9 –\n\n\nwhere (cU + d) is absorbed by Kähler transformation.

Therefore, we discuss two cases: Case I.\nx43 = 0, x44 ̸= 0 and Case II. x43 ̸= 0, x44 = 0.\nCase I. x43 = 0, x44 ̸= 0\nIn this case, by using the condition XtΣX = Σ, an explicit matrix of X is\nX1 =\n1\n√\nad −bc\n\n\n\n\n\nd\n0\nc\n0\n0\na\n0 −2b\nb\n0\na\n0\n0 −c\n2 0\nd\n\n\n\n\n.\n(3.19)\nSince X is the matrix of the symplectic transformation Sp(4, Z) and these elements are\nintegers, we must consider the following conditions for a, b, c and d:\na′ ≡\na\n√\nad −bc,\nb′ ≡\nb\n√\nad −bc,\nc′ ≡1\n2\nc\n√\nad −bc,\nd′ ≡\nd\n√\nad −bc,\n(a′, b′, c′, d′ ∈Z)\n(3.20)\nwhere these definitions lead a′d′ −2b′c′ = 1.

Therefore,\nwe can find that the symplectic basis transformation for the period vector is consistent with\nthe duality symmetry of the complex-structure modulus, as shown in Table 1. Note that\nthe modular transformation is not SL(2, Z) but PSL(2, Z). Thus it is necessary to consider\nthe corresponding subgroup ¯Γ0(2) of PSL(2, Z).6 In general, the subgroup ¯Γ0(n) is defined\nas follows:\n¯Γ0(n) ≡\n( \na b\nc d\n!\n∈PSL(2, Z)\n\f\f\f\f\f c ≡0\n(mod n)\n)\n.\n(3.24)\nMoreover the subgroup ¯Γ0(n) which is written in Table 1 is defined as follows:\n¯Γ0(n) ≡\n( \na b\nc d\n!\n∈PSL(2, Z)\n\f\f\f\f\f b ≡0\n(mod n)\n)\n.\n(3.25)\nCase II. x43 ̸= 0, x44 = 0\nRepeating the same calculation, we can obtain the explicit matrix of X:\nX2 =\n1\n√\n2\n√\nad −bc\n\n\n\n\n\n0\nc\n0\n2d\n−2b 0 −2a\n0\n0\na\n0\n−2b\nd\n0\nc\n0\n\n\n\n\n.\n(3.26)\nSince X is the matrix of the symplectic transformation Sp(4, Z) and these elements are\nintegers, we must consider the following conditions for a, b, c and d:\na′′ ≡1\n2\n√\n2a\n√\nad −bc,\nb′′ ≡\n√\n2b\n√\nad −bc,\nc′′ ≡1\n2\n√\n2c\n√\nad −bc,\nd′′ ≡1\n2\n√\n2d\n√\nad −bc,\n(a′′, b′′, c′′, d′′ ∈Z),\n(3.27)\nwhere these definitions lead 2a′′d′′ −b′′c′′ = 1. By using a′′, b′′, c′′ and d′′, we can describe\nthe symplectic modular transformation as the restricted linear fractional transformation:\nX2 =\n\n\n\n\n\n0\nc′′\n0\n2d′′\n−b′′ 0 −2a′′\n0\n0\na′′\n0\n−b′′\nd′′\n0\nc′′\n0\n\n\n\n\n.\n(3.28)\n6These modular subgroups can also lead to interesting modular flavor symmetries [33].\n– 12 –\n\n\nNow we find that Sp(4, Z) basis transformation can generate the transformation re-\ngarding the subgroup of PSL(2, Z). Here, we consider an element of the symplectic group\nSp(4, Z) as follows:\nSSD =\n\n\n\n\n\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n\n\n\n\n.\n(3.29)\nThen it is found that this element can bridge between X1 and X2 as the following relation:\nSSDx1 = x2,\n(x1 ∈X1, x2 ∈X2) ,\n(3.30)\nwhere these elements have a property of non-Abelian SSDx1 ̸= x1SSD. Therefore, con-\nsidering that the transformation of the dual cohomology basis is Sp(4, Z), the modular\ntransformation group of the complex-structure modulus can be denoted by ¯Γ0(2) and Z2\nregarding SSD as follows:\n¯Γ0(2) ⋊Z2.\n(3.31)\nNext, we focus on the transformation of SSD as the linear fractional transformation.\nTaking account of a transformation S(2) ≡\ni\n√\n2U SSD for the period vector, which includes\nthe Kähler transformation, we find that this is associated with a modular transformation\nU →−1\n2U from the following calculation:\nS(2)Π′ =\ni\n√\n2U\n\n\n\n\n\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n−i\n√\n2U\nU\ni\n√\n2\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n1\ni\n√\n2U\n−1\n2U\ni\n√\n2\n\n\n\n\n.\n(3.32)\nThis transformation U →−1\n2U corresponds to the action of exchanging the inside and the\noutside of a circle of radius\n1\n√\n2 and the circle has a fixed point U = 1\n2 + i\n2 of ¯Γ0(2) in the cir-\ncumference. In other words, for ¯Γ0(2), this can be understood as a natural generalization of\nthe S-transformation of PSL(2, Z). Here, we call it “Scaling duality” [6]. For these results,\nthe basis transformation regarding Sp(4, Z) can be expressed naturally by the subgroup of\nPSL(2, Z) and the generalized S-transformation.\n3.3\nConditions for the construction of the period vector\nIn this section, we discuss the general conditions necessary for the construction of period\nvectors, in order to extend the examples discussed in section 2 and section 3 to the other\norbifolds. First, the conditions for constructing the third-cohomology basis of the toroidal\norbifolds are summarized as follows:\n• The cycles of the toroidal orbifolds are composed of linear combinations of cycles on\nT 6, which have integer coefficients, because the toroidal orbifold is the subspace of\nT 6.\n– 13 –\n\n\n• Each cycle on the toroidal orbifold must be invariant under the Coxeter element Q.\n• The third-cohomology basis of the toroidal orbifold has the symplectic structure as\nEq. (3.2).\nAlthough these conditions restrict the choice of the cycles regarding the toroidal orbifold,\nwe can consider various linear combinations of the cycles of T 6, which satisfy the invariance\nof Q and the symplectic structure. Then, we choose the cycles which have the structure\nof bridging two symplectic transformation matrices by S-transformation or the Scaling\nduality as Eq. (3.30). By considering this condition, we can discuss the generalization\nof the S-transformation naturally and understand the symplectic structure of the period\nvector obviously 7.\nThe explicit form of the period vector can be chosen by the assumption that the pe-\nriod vector has a structure of the Scaling duality. However, the period vector can not be\nfixed because we can take different integer values as the coefficient of overall of the cy-\ncles regarding the third-cohomology basis. In addition, each period vector which has the\ndifferent coefficient generates a different subgroup of the modular transformation. This\nindicates that the symmetry emerging in the low-energy effective theory depends on the\nspecific choice of coefficients for the overall of the cycles. Hence, the absence of a guiding\nprinciple for selecting these coefficients is a problem.\nTo resolve this problem, we discuss the consistency between the modular symmetry of\nthe period vector and the duality symmetries. Table 1 shows the duality symmetries of the\ntoroidal orbifolds which have a complex-structure modulus for the untwisted sector. Here,\nour research can identify other duality symmetries that are distinct from those shown in\nprevious research [20]. We discuss the details of the duality symmetries derived from the\nstructure of the winding and the momentum numbers regarding the mass spectrum of the\ntype IIB closed string in Appendix A.\n7Elements of set generated by the symplectic transformation of the period vector or the modular trans-\nformation of the complex-structure modulus are also candidates of the period vector.\n– 14 –\n\n\nZN, ZN × ZM\nLattice\nDuality symmetries of U\nZ4\nSU(4)2\nPSL(2, Z)\nZ4\nSU(2) × SU(4) × SO(5)\n¯Γ0(2)\nZ4\nSU(2)2 × SO(5)2\nPSL(2, Z)\nZ6−II\nSU(2) × SU(6)\n¯Γ0(3)\nZ6−II\nSU(3) × SO(8)\n¯Γ0(3)\nZ6−II\nSU(2)2 × SU(3)2\nPSL(2, Z)\nZ6−II\nSU(2)2 × SU(3) × G2\nPSL(2, Z)\nZ8−II\nSU(2) × SO(10)\n¯Γ0(2)\nZ8−II\nSO(4) × SO(9)\nPSL(2, Z)\nZ12−II\nSO(4) × F4\nPSL(2, Z)\nZ2 × Z4\nSU(2)2 × SO(5)2\nPSL(2, Z)\nZ2 × Z6\nSU(2)2 × SU(3) × G2\nPSL(2, Z)\nTable 1: The duality symmetries regarding the complex-structure modulus on T 6/ZN and\nT 6/(ZN ×ZM) orbifold. In the case of SU(3)×SO(8) loot lattice, the complex-structure\nmodulus is defined as U ′ ≡U + 2.\nTaking account of the consistency, we must revisit definitions of the intersection number\nand the expansion of the holomorphic three-form. If the above duality symmetries can be\nrealized by the basis transformation of the period vector, it is necessary to discuss the way\nof constructing the third-cohomology basis and the holomorphic three-form as Eqs. (2.10),\n(3.2) and (3.4), which is not the usual normalization as XI =\nR\nAI Ω, FI =\nR\nBI Ω. Finally,\nby assuming these conditions, we can uniquely determine the period vector that satisfies\nthe duality symmetry in the low-energy effective theory of string theory. The additional\nconditions taken into account are shown as follows:\n• The period vector has a structure where the Scaling duality bridges the symplectic\ntransformation matrices of the period vector. In other words, these actions are realized\nas an outer automorphism of the symplectic transformation group Sp(4, Z).\n• The modular transformation of the period vector is consistent with the duality sym-\nmetries of the complex-structure modulus.\nFor the other orbifolds, we summarize the results of these calculations in Appendix B.\n4\nFlux landscape of type IIB string theory\n4.1\nEffective action and three-form fluxes G3\nIn this section, we discuss the construction of effective potentials induced by three-form\nfluxes by using the third-cohomology basis and the holomorphic three-form which are con-\nstructed in section 2 and section 3. Here, we define the three-form fluxes as G3 ≡F3 −SH3\nwhere F3 denotes the Ramond-Ramond three-form, H3 denotes the three-form in the Neveu-\nScwarz sector, and S ≡C0 + i e−ϕ is the axio-dilaton. In the effective Lagrangian of type\n– 15 –\n\n\nIIB supergravity, the Kähler potential K and the Gukov-Vafa-Witten superpotential W\n[34] are denoted by\nK = −log\n\u0000−i\n\u0000S −¯S\n\u0001\u0001\n−log\n\u0012\n−i\nZ\nΩ∧¯Ω\n\u0013\n,\n(4.1)\nW =\nZ\nG3 ∧Ω,\n(4.2)\nand the no-scale type scalar potential in the unit of MPl = 1 is also denoted by\nV = eK \u0010\nKI ¯JDIWD ¯J ¯W\n\u0011\n,\n(4.3)\nwhere the labels I, J include the axio-dilaton and the complex-structure modulus. KIJ is\nthe inverse of the Kähler metric KI ¯J ≡∂I∂¯JK and DIW ≡∂W + KIW is the covariant\nderivative of W.\nIn this study, we discuss the quantization of the three-form fluxes of Eq. (4.2) on the\ncycles of T 6 as follows:\nZ\nT 6/Z4\n(F3, H3) ∧αi ≡(−bi, −di),\nZ\nT 6/Z4\n(F3, H3) ∧βi ≡(ai, ci),\nZ\nT 6/Z4\n(F3, H3) ∧γi ≡(−fi, −hi),\nZ\nT 6/Z4\n(F3, H3) ∧δi ≡(ei, gi).\n(4.4)\nHere, we consider the quantization which has no contribution of the twisted sector associated\nwith the complex structure moduli. By using these definitions, the three-form fluxes on the\ncycles which are invariant under the Coxeter element Q can be denoted by\n1\n4\nZ\nT 6/Z4\n(F3, H3) ∧1A0 = 1\n8\nZ\nT 6/Z4\n(F3, H3) ∧\nhX\nΓ(α1)\ni\n= 1\n8\nZ\nT 6/Z4\n(F3, H3) ∧\n\u0002\nQ(α1) + Q2(α1) + Q3(α1) + Q4(α1)\n\u0003\n= 1\n2(−b1, −d1),\n1\n8\nZ\nT 6/Z4\n(F3, H3) ∧1A1 = 1\n2(a1, c1),\n1\n4\nZ\nT 6/Z4\n(F3, H3) ∧1B0 = (e2, g2),\n1\n8\nZ\nT 6/Z4\n(F3, H3) ∧1B1 = 1\n2(−b0, −d0).\n(4.5)\nThe overall factors 1/4 and 1/8 are terms to offset overcounting of the intersection numbers\nEq. (2.10) as the same discussion as in Eq. (3.3) and Eq. (3.4). In the second line of Eq.\n(4.5), the number of the elements of Γ(α0) is found by the length of orbit in Eq. (2.8). In\naddition, we know a relation Q(dx1 ∧dx2 ∧dx3 ∧dx4 ∧dx5 ∧dx6) = dx1 ∧dx2 ∧dx3 ∧dx4 ∧\ndx5 ∧dx6 and this result derives\nR\nT 6/Z4(F3, H3) ∧Qn(α1) =\nR\nT 6/Z4(F3, H3) ∧α1. Thus,\nthe three-form fluxes on the invariant cycles under Q are denoted by the flux quanta of\n– 16 –\n\n\nT 6. Taking account of the quantization of these three-form fluxes, it is necessary to choose\nspecific constant multiples for the flux quanta as follows:\n(b1, d1) ∈4Z,\n(a1, c1) ∈4Z,\n(e2, g2) ∈2Z,\n(b0, d0) ∈4Z.\n(4.6)\nNote that, for simplicity, we consider the additional even multiples for the flux quanta in\norder to avoid the exotic O3-planes [6, 35–38].\nBy using these results, we can construct the expansion of G3 as\nG3 = (e2 −Sg2)1A0 −1\n2(b0 −Sd0)1A1 + 1\n2(b1 −Sd1)1B0 −1\n2(a1 −Sc1)1B1\n= (e2 −Sg2)\n\u0000α0 −γ2 −2γ3 −δ5 −δ6\u0001\n−1\n2(b0 −Sd0)\n\u0000−2β0 −γ5 + γ6 −δ3\u0001\n+ 1\n2(b1 −Sd1)\n\u00002β1 + γ5 −γ6 −2δ2 −δ3\u0001\n−(a1 −Sc1)\n\u0000α0 −α1 −δ5 + δ6\u0001\n.\n(4.7)\nThen, we can describe Nflux as follows:\nNflux =\nZ\nH3 ∧F3 = 2(a1d0 −c1b0 −g2b1 + e2d1) ∈16Z.\n(4.8)\nSince we can obtain the three-form fluxes and the holomorphic three-form, the superpo-\ntential can be represented by them. The general form of the superpotential is expressed as\nfollows:\nW = A + BS + U [C + DS] ,\n(4.9)\nand A, B, C and D in the case of T 6/Z4 orientifold with SU(2)×SU(4)×SO(5) root lattice\ncan be found by the calculation of Eq. (4.2) as follows:\nA = −1\n√\n2(b1 −ib0),\nC = −\n√\n2(e2 + ia1),\nB =\n1\n√\n2(d1 −id0),\nD =\n√\n2(g2 + ic1).\n(4.10)\nTaking account of the landscape of type IIB supergravity, the stationary point ∂IV = 0\nleads to the VEVs of the axio-dilaton and the complex-structure modulus. It is possible to\nobtain them by solving the following F-term equations:\n\n\n\n\n\nDUW = ∂UW + KUW= 0\nDSW = ∂SW + KSW = 0\nW = 0\n⇒\n\n\n\n\n\nC + DS = 0\nB + DU = 0\nA + CU = 0\n,\n(4.11)\nwhich is an overdetermined system. Therefore, we can derive the flux landscape of SUSY\nMinkowski solutions regarding the axio-dilaton and the complex-structure moduli as follows:\n⟨S⟩= −C\nD,\n⟨U⟩= −B\nD,\nAD −BC = 0.\n(4.12)\n– 17 –\n\n\n4.2\nFlux transformations for symmetries in the F-term equations\nFor the modular symmetries of the complex-structure modulus in the type IIB flux land-\nscape, it is not enough to discuss the transformation of the period vector because the\nthree-form fluxes on the cycles of orientifold break the modular symmetry.

Since the action of the low-energy effective theory\nassociated with type IIB string theory is described by the period vector, the research of\nthese symmetries corresponds to revealing the symmetries appearing in the low-energy ef-\nfective theory. In particular, it is known that the flux landscape of type IIB supergravity\ntends to be realized at fixed points in the modular transformation groups [5, 6]. It motivates\nus to construct the period vectors which are consistent with string theory and examine the\nmodular symmetries emerging from the geometric structure of the toroidal orbifolds.\nIn section 2 and section 3, we constructed the period vector on T 6/Z4 orbifold with\nSU(2) × SU(4) × SO(5) root lattice. Although the explicit period vector can be obtained\nby using the traditional discussions regarding the holomorphic three-form and the third-\ncohomology basis, there is redundancy concerning the linear combinations of the cycles in\nthe third-cohomology basis. Then we partially eliminated this redundancy by choosing the\ncycles that have the structure of “Scaling duality” in section 3.2 because we can discuss the\nnatural generalization for S-transformation of PSL(2, Z). Note that there is still redun-\ndancy that some period vectors can be transformed into the desired period vector by the\nsymplectic transformation group Sp(4, Z).\nIn addition, we must consider the problem that the overall coefficients of the cycles\nare unfixed. Since the overall factors are associated with the intersection numbers and the\nrelative differences regarding the elements of the period vectors, the different overall factors\ngenerate different modular symmetries. For this point, the factors of the cycles in T 6/Z4\norbifold can be determined by choosing the period vector that the modular symmetry is\nthe same as the duality symmetries. Here, we need to carefully discuss the definition of\nthe coordinates of each cycle concerning the period vector in section 3.1.\nIn terms of\nmodular symmetry, this condition allows the realization of the low-energy effective theory\nthat is consistent with string theory. By using these conditions, the period vectors can be\nconstructed on some toroidal orbifolds and we can conclude that the structure of “Scaling\nduality” and the consistency with duality symmetries is necessary to discuss the systematic\nclassification of the modular symmetries regarding the period vectors.\nFurthermore, by taking account of the cycles on the toroidal orbifolds, we defined the\nthree-form fluxes G3 and constructed the Gukov-Vafa-Witten superpotential. Then it is\nfound that the flux quanta take the specific constant multiples on the cycles of T 6/Z4\norientifold as same as the discussion in [6].\nIn addition, by revealing the explicit flux\ntransformations for the modular transformation of the complex-structure modulus, we can\nrealize the modular symmetries in the type IIB flux landscape. In our future work, we\nwill discuss the Dirac quantization of the three-form fluxes and the tadpole cancellation\ncondition in detail because we only consider the brief discussion of the flux quanta to avoid\nthe exotic O3-plane.\n– 20 –\n\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by K2-SPRING program Grant number JPMJSP2136\n(T.

The partition function for the bosonic closed string part in type II can\nbe obtained from ten-dimensional bosonic one of heterotic strings.\nThe starting point is the one-loop partition function for type IIB closed strings on the\nsix-dimensional torus\nZIIB(τ, ¯τ, G, B) =\n1\n4τ2(η¯η)12\n\f\fϑ4\n3 −ϑ4\n4 −ϑ4\n2\n\f\f2 X\nP∈Λ\nq\n1\n2 P 2\nL ¯q\n1\n2 P 2\nR,\n(A.1)\nwhere τ = τ1 +iτ2 is the modulus of the world–sheet torus and q = e2πiτ. The τ-dependent\nfunctions η(τ) and ϑi(τ) are the Dedekind eta function and the i-th elliptic theta function,\nrespectively. The summation of P over the lattice Λ comes from the internal directions and\nthe element P of the lattice is expressed as\nPL = p\n2 + (G −B)w,\n(A.2a)\nPR = p\n2 −(G + B)w,\n(A.2b)\nwhere w and p are integer six vectors taking values on the lattice Λ and its dual Λ∗,\ncorresponding to the winding numbers and the Kaluza-Klein momenta, and the background\nfields G and B are a metric of the torus and an anti-symmetric tensor, called the moduli\nof the torus. The lattice Λ, called the Narain lattice, must be even and self-dual by the\nmodular invariance of the partition function.\nFrom now on, we consider the T 6/ZN orbifolds for simplicity, but the following discus-\nsion can easily be generalized to the ZM × ZN orbifolds. In general, the partition function\nfor the orbifolds can be written as the sum of all of the sectors projected by ZN twists θ:\nZorb(τ, ¯τ, G, B) = 1\nN\nN−1\nX\nk,l=0\nZ[θk, θl],\n(A.3)\nwhere the blocks Z[1, θl] are called the untwisted sectors while the other blocks correspond\nto the contributions from the twisted string states, which can be obtained by the modular\ntransformations of the untwisted sectors. An important fact is that if l is a divisor of N,\nZ[1, θl] has the dependence of the moduli G, B which comes from the summation of the\nmomentum lattice, and then the twisted sector obtained from that untwisted sector also\nhas the moduli dependence. In these sectors, some supersymmetries are preserved since\n– 21 –\n\n\nθl leaves some fixed directions when l is a divisor of N. In order to study the duality\nsymmetry, it is enough to focus on those moduli-dependent parts of the partition functions.\nThe orbifold twists θ are realized by Coxeter elements Q that specify the orbifold point\ngroup.\nIn order to ensure that the point group is an automorphism of the lattice, the\nbackground G, B must satisfy\nQtGQ = G,\nQtBQ = B.\n(A.4)\nSolving these conditions, one can find that the moduli are (partially) fixed. The moduli-\ndependent part in the untwisted sectors can be expressed as\nZ(1,θl)(τ, ¯τ, G, B) =\nX\nP∈Λ⊥\nq\n1\n2 P t\nLG−1PL ¯q\n1\n2 P t\nRG−1PR,\n(A.5)\nwhere Λ⊥is the sub-lattice of Λ invariant under Ql and we assume l to be a divisor of N.\nFrom the invariance under orbifold twists, the windings w and momenta p must satisfy\nQlw = w,\n((Qt)−1)lp = p,\n(A.6)\nwhich lead to the fixed directions and the duality groups of the orbifold theories.\nAs a concrete example, we take the T 6/Z4 orbifold with the SU(2) × SU(4) × SO(5)\nroot lattice, as discussed in sections 2 and 3. In this case, the moduli-dependent parts in\nthe untwisted sectors are Z(1,1), Z(1,θ2) and in the twisted sectors are Z(θ2,1), Z(θ2,θ2), which\ncan be obtained by a S- and ST-transformation from Z(1,θ2), respectively. We can focus on\nZ(1,θ2) to identify the duality group of this theory.\nConditions Q2w = w and ((Qt)−1)2p = p give fixed directions (2.15), where Q is\ngiven by (2.2).\nThe invariant lattice Λ⊥under Q2 gives the two-dimensional sub-torus\nwith the metric G⊥and B-field B⊥defined by wtGw = (n1 n2)G⊥(n1 n2)t and ptBp =\n(m1 m2)B⊥(m1 m2)t. We introduce the Kähler and complex structure moduli U and T\ndefined as\nT = 2(B⊥12 + i\np\ndetG⊥),\nU =\n1\nG⊥11\n(G⊥12 + i\np\ndetG⊥).\n(A.7)\nUsing these moduli, we can write down Z(1,θ2) as\nZ(1,θ2)(τ, ¯τ, T, U) =\nX\nm1,m2,n1,n2∈Z\ne2πiτ1(2m1n1+m2n2)e−πτ2\nT2U2 |TUn2+Tn1−2Um1+m2|2\n,\n(A.8)\nwhere U = U1 + iU2 and T = T1 + iT2. From this partition function, we can read off the\nmass spectrum of strings for the two-dimensional sub-torus\nm2\n⊥=\nX\nm1,m2,n1,n2∈Z\n1\nT2U2\n|TUn2 + Tn1 −2Um1 + m2|2,\n(A.9)\nwhich is invariant under the following transformations on T and U:\nT →T + 2,\nT →\nT\nT + 1,\n(A.10a)\nU →U + 1,\nU →−\nU\n2U −1.\n(A.10b)\nTherefore, we conclude that the duality group for this orbifold is given by Γ0(2)T ×Γ0(2)U.\nThe duality symmetries in the other cases can also be studied in the same way.\n– 22 –\n\n\nB\nVarious orbifolds\nIn this appendix, we show the period vectors and three-from fluxes in various orbifold\ncompactifications with h2,1\nuntw. = 1.\nB.1\nT 6/Z4 orbifold with SU(4)2 root lattice\nConsidering T 6/Z4 orbifold, it is required that the six-dimensional metric is invariant under\nthe action of Γ = Z4.

To fix explicit cycles of a third-cohomology basis regarding the\nuntwisted complex structure modulus, which is necessary to construct the period\nvectors, we find that the following two symmetries are required for the period\nvectors: (i) ``Scaling duality '' which is a generalized $S$-transformation of\n$PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ and (ii) the modular symmetries to be consistent with\nsymmetries derived from mass spectra of the closed string in type IIB string\ntheory. Furthermore, by considering flux quanta on the cycles, we explore type\nIIB flux vacua on toroidal orientifolds and flux transformations under the\nmodular symmetries of the period vectors.",
