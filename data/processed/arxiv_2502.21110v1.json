Li\nDepartment of Aerospace Engineering\nUniversity of Michigan\nmaxzli@umich.edu\nChuchu Fan\nDepartment of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nchuchu@mit.edu\nABSTRACT\nIncreased deployment of autonomous systems in fields like transportation and\nrobotics has led to a corresponding increase in safety-critical failures. These\nfailures are difficult to model and debug due to the relative lack of data: while\nnormal operations provide tens of thousands of examples, we may have only\nseconds of data leading up to the failure. This scarcity makes it challenging to train\ngenerative models of rare failure events, as existing methods risk either overfitting\nto noise in the limited failure dataset or underfitting due to an overly strong prior.\nWe address this challenge with CALNF, or calibrated normalizing flows, a self-\nregularized framework for posterior learning from limited data. CALNF achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on data-limited failure modeling problems and enables\na first-of-a-kind case study of the 2022 Southwest Airlines scheduling crisis.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nWhen complex systems fail, the first step towards recovery is understanding the factors that lead to\nfailure. Modeling failures and other rare events is challenging because the limited amount of available\ndata. While much work has been done on preemptive failure prediction in simulation (Corso et al.,\n2022; O’ Kelly et al., 2018; Sinha et al., 2020; Dawson & Fan, 2023; Delecki et al., 2023; Zhong\net al., 2023), and online failure detection (Keipour et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2018; Gudovskiy\net al., 2022; Kang et al., 2022; Najari et al., 2022; Garg et al., 2023), relatively little work has been\ndone on post-event failure modeling from observational data.\nIn failure modeling problems, we seek to infer the hidden factors contributing to an observed failure\nby learning a posterior distribution over those factors. When observational data are plentiful, deep\ngenerative models can be powerful tools for solving these problems, but these methods struggle when\nonly a few examples are available. To solve rare event modeling problems that arise in domains like\nrobotics and networked cyberphysical systems, we need new ways of training generative models in\ndata-constrained settings.\nFormally, we frame rare event modeling as a data-constrained Bayesian inverse problem where we\naim to infer the distribution of latent variables z from noisy observations x of a stochastic process\nx ∼pθ(x|z; y), where θ are unknown process parameters and y are known context variables, all\nreal-valued (Stuart, 2010). Given nominal observations D0 = {x(i)\n0 , y(i)\n0 }N0\ni=1 and a much smaller set\nof target observations Dt = {x(i)\nt , y(i)\nt }Nt\ni=1, where Nt ≪N0, we aim to learn an approximation of\nthe posterior distribution\nqϕ(z) ≈pθ\n\u0010\nz|{x(i)\nt , y(i)\nt }Nt\ni=1\n\u0011\n.\n(1)\n1\narXiv:2502.21110v1  [cs.LG]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nNote that this problem is distinct from the rare event simulation problem considered in O’ Kelly et al.\n(2018); Sinha et al. (2020); Gao et al. (2023), and Dawson & Fan (2023). While we focus on learning\nthe distribution of failures from small, fixed number of real-world data points, these methods assume\nthe ability to sample and label an arbitrary number of new failure examples in simulation.\nIn data-constrained settings, a common approach to solving inverse and few-shot generative modeling\nproblems is to use the nominal observations to train a deep model of the prior distribution, then\nuse this prior to regularize qϕ (e.g. by penalizing the divergence between qϕ and the learned prior,\nAsim et al. (2020); Liu et al. (2023); Abdollahzadeh et al. (2023); Zhang et al. (2019); Ojha et al.\n(2021); Higgins et al. (2016)). Unfortunately, it can be difficult to specify the appropriate amount of\nregularization a priori, particularly when the distribution of z differs between the nominal and target\ndatasets (as if often the case in failure modeling problems).\nIn this paper, we address this challenge by developing CALNF, or calibrated normalizing flows.\nTo make full use of available data, CALNF amortizes inference over both the nominal and target\ndatasets, learning a shared representation for both posteriors. To prevent overfitting, CALNF first\nlearns a low-dimensional embedding for a family of candidate posteriors then searches over this\nlow-dimensional space to find an optimal representation of the target posterior. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on a range of data-constrained inference benchmarks, including several\nwith real-world data from autonomous systems. We apply our method to a post-mortem analysis of\nthe 2022 Southwest Airlines scheduling crisis, which stranded more than 2 million passengers and\nled to more than $750 million in financial losses (Rose, 2023); our first-of-a-kind analysis suggests a\nmechanism by which failure propagated through the Southwest network.\n2\nBACKGROUND\nBecause the posterior in Eq. (1) is typically intractable to evaluate exactly, inverse problems are\ntypically solved approximately, often using variational inference (Stuart, 2010). These methods\napproximate the true posterior by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO, Kingma & Welling\n(2013)), often using deep non-parametric representations like normalizing flows for qϕ (Tabak &\nVanden-Eijnden, 2010; Rezende & Mohamed, 2015).\nL(ϕ, θ, D) =\nE\n(x,y)∈D\nE\nz∼qϕ(z) [log pθ(x, z; y) −log qϕ(z)] .\n(2)\nA particular challenge in data-constrained settings is that deep models tend to overfit the particu-\nlar target samples used for training, as shown in Fig. 1c. As the following result illustrates, the\nrepresentational power of these models makes them highly sensitive when trained on small datasets.\nLemma 1. Let D = {z(i)}N\ni=1 be sparse dataset with distance O\n\u0000(LN)−1/(d+1)\u0001\nbetween points\n(the precise limit is given in the appendix), and let qϕ(z) be a model capable of representing any\nL-Lipschitz probability density. If ϕ(D) are the parameters of the maximum likelihood estimator1\ngiven D, then the optimal solutions trained on datasets differing by one point D1 = D ∪\n\b\nz(1)\t\nand\nD2 = D ∪\n\b\nz(2)\t\nwill differ by Wasserstein distance W2\n\u0000qϕ(D1), qϕ(D2)\n\u0001\n= ||z(1) −z(2)||/N.\n1We provide these results for maximum likelihood estimation, but similar results can be shown for maximum\na posteriori or maximum ELBO contexts.\n(c) KL regularized, β=0.01\n(b) Imbalanced dataset\nTarget\nNominal\n(a) GT\n(d) KL regularized, β=1.0\n(e) CalNF (ours)\nFigure 1: Inference in data-constrained environments.

(d) When β is too large, the learned distribution underfits and struggles\nto distinguish between nominal and target distributions. (e) Our method learns a more accurate\nreconstruction of the target distribution using hyperparameter-insensitive self-regularization.\n2\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nThe proof relies on the fact that the optimal L-Lipschitz maximum likelihood estimator is qϕ(D)(z) =\nP\nz(i)∈D ˆδ(z −z(i)), where ˆδ(z) = max(0, a −L||z||) is an L-Lipschitz approximation of δ(z)/N\nand a is a constant given in the appendix. Lemma 1 implies that small changes in the training data\ncan lead to large changes in the learned distribution; as N becomes small, this sensitivity increases.\nTwo common strategies for reducing this sensitivity in non-sparse settings are bootstrapping (Efron,\n1992), which trains an ensemble of models on random subsamples of the target data, and prior\nregularization (Asim et al., 2020), which uses a model trained on nominal data to regularize the target\nposterior. Unfortunately, both of these methods are difficult to apply to data-constrained problems.\nBootstrapping, or ensemble, methods are theoretically well-motivated (Efron, 1992; Breiman, 1996)\nbut do not fully avoid data sensitivity issues when applied to deep models (Nixon et al., 2020). In\nfact, it can be shown that bootstrapping has no effect on data sensitivity in highly data-constrained\nenvironments.\nLemma 2. Consider the setting from Lemma 1. Let Di be K subsampled datasets created by sampling\nN points with replacement from the original D. Let ϕ(Di) be parameters of the maximum likelihood\nestimator for each Di and define the ensemble model qensemble(z) = PK\ni=1 qϕi(z)/K. As K →∞, the\nensemble model recovers the solution of the non-bootstrapped problem; i.e. qensemble(z) →qϕ(D)(z).\nThe second strategy, prior regularization, is common in the few-shot learning literature, particularly\nfor image generation tasks (Asim et al., 2020; Higgins et al., 2016; Abdollahzadeh et al., 2023).\nThese methods use a large dataset to learn the nominal posterior distribution, then use that nominal\nposterior to regularize the target posterior:\nϕ0 = argmaxϕL(ϕ, θ, D0)\nϕt = argmaxϕL(ϕ, θ, Dt) −βDKL(qϕ0, qϕ)\n(3)\nThis penalty allows the large number of nominal samples to regularize the distribution learned from\nthe target data, but there are two issues with this approach. First, it is difficult to choose an appropriate\npenalty strength β a priori, as illustrated using the toy example in Fig. 1. If β is too small, the model\nwill overfit to the target data (Fig. 1c), but if β is too large then the model will underfit the target\nin favor of learning the nominal distribution (Fig. 1d). Moreover, even if we were able to select an\noptimal β, many practical failure modeling problems involve a large shift between the nominal and\ntarget distributions, in which case regularizing between these distributions may not be appropriate.\nIn order to effectively train deep generative models of rare failure events, we will need to address two\nkey questions. First, building upon prior regularization: can we adapt the amount of regularization\nbased on the available data rather than specifying a regularization penalty a priori? Second, building\nupon bootstrapping: can we share information between model components to learn robustly in\ndata-constrained contexts?\n2.1\nRELATED WORK\nA number of recent works have explored various forms of prior regularization, mostly in the context\nof image generation tasks (see Abdollahzadeh et al. (2023) for a survey). Asim et al. (2020) use a deep\nprior model trained on large image datasets to regularize single-shot maximum likelihood estimation\nfor image denoising. Liu et al. (2023) combine prior regularization with graduated optimization for\nimage reconstruction, gradually increasing the regularization strength over multiple inference rounds.\nOjha et al. (2021) pre-train a model on a large open image dataset, then fine-tune to smaller image\ndatasets with a loss function that preserves relative difference and similarity across domains. Kong\net al. (2022) focus on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and regularize the generator’s latent\nspace by sampling points in between sparse target data. Other works rely on data augmentation, either\nusing hand-designed heuristics Wang et al. (2020), which must be re-derived for each new problem\ndomain, or pre-trained generative models Tran et al. (2017); Zheng et al. (2023), which require a\nminimum amount of data from similar examples.\n3\nMETHOD: CALIBRATED NORMALIZING FLOWS\nTo address the challenges from Section 2, we propose a novel framework for rare event modeling:\ncalibrated normalizing flows, or CALNF. This method involves two steps, illustrated in Fig. 2. First,\nwe learn a low-dimensional embedding for a family of probability distributions that includes both the\n3\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nnominal posterior and several candidate target posteriors. We then search over this low-dimensional\nspace to find the optimal representation of the target posterior. To ensure that the embedding space is\nwell behaved, we apply regularization between candidate target posteriors. This self-regularization,\ncombined with implicit regularization from our use of a single, shared representation for both the\ntarget and nominal posteriors, allows CALNF to efficiently learn the posterior without overfitting.\n[          ]\nFlow Network\n[          ]\n[          ]\n[          ]\nCalibration Label\nBase Distribution\n{\n[          ]\n[λ, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, λ, 0, 0, 0]\n...\n[0, 0, 0, 0, λ]\nλ = 0\nλ = 1\nFigure 2: (Left) CalNF architecture: A normalizing flow is trained on random subsamples of the\ntarget data and the full nominal dataset, using one-hot labels to identify different subsamples (•)\nand the zero vector to identify the nominal data (◦). The model is calibrated by freezing the model\nparameters and optimizing the label on the entire target dataset (⋆). (Right) Target candidates: The\nnominal posterior qϕ(z; 0) (blue) and the family of candidate distributions for the target posterior\nqϕ(z; λ1i), shown for varying values of the calibration label.\nThe first step in our framework is to learn an embedding for a family of candidate probability\ndistributions. To do this, we randomly sample K subsets of the target data D(1)\nt , . . . , D(K)\nt\n, then train\na single conditional normalizing flow qϕ(z; c) to learn a mapping from a low-dimensional label c to\nthe posterior distribution conditioned on each of these subsets. We identify the posterior for each\ntarget subset using one-hot labels 1i and use the zero label 0K to identify the nominal posterior; i.e.:\nqϕ(z; 0K) ≈p(z|D0),\nqϕ(z; 1i) ≈p(z|D(i)\nt ), i = 1, . . . , K\nOnce posteriors have been learned for each of these subsets, we calibrate the model by holding the\nmodel weights ϕ constant and searching for an optimal label c∗such that qϕ(z; c∗) ≈p(z|Dt).\nThis training process is shown in more detail in Algorithm 1. This algorithm modifies the standard\nvariational inference training process in two ways: by training on multiple random subsets of the\ntarget data, and by interleaving model updates and label calibration. To begin, we split the target\ntraining data into K random subsets with one-hot labels and train the model to learn the posterior\nfor each subset. Each subset Di\nt is created by independently drawing Nt samples from Dt with\nreplacement. We denote the empirical ELBO given dataset D as\nL (ϕ, c, D) =\n1\n|D|\nX\n(x,y)∈D\nE\nz∼qϕ(z;c) [log p(x, z; y) −log qϕ(z; c)] .\n(4)\nThe model is trained with three objectives: to maximize the ELBO on each target subset (with one-hot\nlabels), the nominal data (with a zero label), and the full target dataset (using the calibrated label c∗).\nIn addition, to improve the conditioning of the embedding space, we add a regularization term on the\ndivergence between the posterior distributions learned for each target subset, yielding the loss:\nL(ϕ, c) = −1\nK\nK\nX\ni=1\nL\n\u0010\nϕ, 1i, D(i)\nt\n\u0011\n−L (ϕ, 0K, D0) −L(ϕ, c, Dt) + β\nK\nX\ni̸=j\nDKL (qϕ(·; 1i), qϕ(·; 1j))\n(5)\nThis additional regularization term reflects the fact that the target subsamples D(i)\nt\nare identically\ndistributed, so the divergence between the candidate posteriors learned for each subsample should be\nsmall, and we show empirically that CALNF performs well for a range of β. The mixture label c∗is\ninitialized at [1/K, . . . , 1/K] and updated to maximize c∗= arg maxc L(ϕ, c, Dt). In practice, this\nis equivalent to jointly optimizing (ϕ, c∗) = arg min L(ϕ, c∗), but we show these optimization steps\nseparately in Alg. 1 to emphasize the different objectives.\n4\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nAlgorithm 1 Calibrated Normalizing Flows\nInput: Nominal data D0, target data Dt, step size γ, number of target subsamples K,\nself-regularization β\nOutput: Model parameters ϕ and calibrated label c∗\nfor k = 1, . . . , K do\nD(k)\nt\n←N-element random subsample of Dt\nend for\nInitialize ϕ, c∗\nwhile ϕ not converged do\nUpdate model ϕ ←ϕ −γ∇ϕL(ϕ, c∗)\nUpdate calibration c∗←c∗−γ∇cLcal(ϕ, c∗)\nend while\n3.1\nTHEORETICAL ANALYSIS\nThe secondary optimization of c∗is one of the main differences between CALNF and traditional\nbootstrapped ensembles (which combine the target candidates in a mixture model rather than opti-\nmizing in a lower-dimensional label space). In this section, we provide theoretical motivation for\nthis decision, showing that learning a mapping from labels c to candidate distributions implicitly\nregularizes the learned target posterior.\nIn particular, consider the Wasserstein metric W2(p1, p2) = infγ\n\u0002\nEz1,z2∼γ ||z1 −z2||2\u00031/2 where\nγ is a coupling of probability distributions p1 and p2 The result show that CALNF, in addition to\nexplicitly regularizing the divergence between target candidates, also provides implicit regularization\nof the W2 metric between the learned nominal and calibrated target posteriors.\nTheorem 1. If the flow map fϕ(z, c) is L-Lipschitz in the second argument, then the Wasserstein\ndistance between the nominal and target posteriors is bounded; W2 (qϕ(z, 0K), qϕ(z, c∗)) ≤L||c∗||\nA proof is included in the appendix, along with L for common normalizing flow architectures.\n4\nEXPERIMENTS\n4.1\nBENCHMARK PROBLEMS\nThis section describes the benchmark problems used in our experiments; the first is newly developed\nfor our study, but the rest are previously-published benchmarks (Keipour et al., 2021; Deng et al.,\n2022). We also include the toy 2D problem in Fig. 1 (N0 = 103, Nt = 20). More details are provided\nin the appendix, and we provide open-source code and data.\nAir traffic disruptions\nWe develop a stochastic queuing model of the Southwest Airlines network\nusing publicly available arrival and departure data, based on (Pyrgiotis et al., 2013). The latent\nvariables represent travel times, runway delays, and overnight aircraft reserves. The context includes\nflight schedules, and observations include actual departure and arrival times. Nominal and failure\ndata from between Dec. 1 through Dec. 20 and Dec. 21 through Dec. 30, respectively, are used\nfor the four busiest airports. The four-airport sub-network has 24 latent variables. We train using\nN0 = 9 and Nt = 4 and evaluate on 4 held-out failure data points (each data point is a single day\nwith between 88–102 flights).\nAerial vehicle control\nWe consider a failure detection benchmark for unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAVs) using the ALFA dataset (Keipour et al., 2021). This dataset includes real-world data from a\nUAV during normal flight and during failures with various deactivated control surfaces. The latent\nvariable z parameterizes the nonlinear attitude dynamics and has 21 dimensions, y includes the current\nand commanded states, and x is the next state. We train on 10 nominal trajectories (N0 = 2235) and\n1 failure trajectory (Nt = 58) and evaluate on a held-out failure trajectory (69 points).\nGeophysical imaging\nSeismic waveform inversion (SWI) is a well-known geophysics problem\nused as a benchmark for inference and physics-informed learning (Gouveia & Scales, 1998; Deng\n5\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nTable 1: ELBO (nats/dim) on held-out anomaly data on benchmark problems. 2D and SWI use\nunseen synthetic data for the test set; all other cases withhold half of the target data for testing.

SWI seeks to infer the properties of the Earth’s subsurface using\nseismic measurements, which are simulated using the elastic wave equation. This model uses latent\nvariables z for subsurface density, context y for the source signal, and observations x for the seismic\nmeasurements (Richardson, 2023). The latent space has 100 dimensions (a 10 × 10 grid). We train\non N0 = 100 and Nt = 4 and evaluate on 500 synthetic samples.\n4.2\nBASELINES AND METRICS\nOur main claim is that our CALNF framework is an effective way to learn the posterior when a\nsmall number of target data points are available. The most relevant comparisons are to the prior\nregularization and bootstrapping ensemble methods discussed in Section 2. In particular, we compare\nagainst three baselines from previously-published literature: prior regularization using KL divergence\n(based on Asim et al. (2020)), prior regularization using Wasserstein divergence (based on Finlay et al.\n(2020) and Onken et al. (2021)), and an ensemble method based on a mixture of normalizing flows\n(adapted from the generative ensembles proposed in Choi et al. (2019)). The two prior regularization\nbaselines are sensitive to the hyperparameter β, so we report results for a range β ∈[0.01, 1.0].\nCALNF uses K = 5 and β = 1.0 for all problems, and Figs. 11 and 12 in the appendix shows the\nsensitivity of our method to varying K and β. We use K = 5 components for the ensemble baseline.\nSince the large amount of nominal data makes it easy to fit the nominal distribution, we compare\nprimarily on the basis of the evidence lower bound L computed on held-out target data, reporting\nthe mean and standard deviation over four random seeds. When useful, we also provide visual\ncomparisons of the posterior distributions learned using different methods.\n4.3\nRESULTS & DISCUSSION\nOur main empirical results are shown in Table 1. Our method achieves better performance on held-out\ntarget data than baselines on all problems. Of course, CALNF’s improved performance comes at the\ncost of increased training time, requiring K additional likelihood evaluations per step relative to the\nKL- and W2-regularized methods (and the same number of evaluations as the ensemble method).\nTo qualitatively understand the difference in performance between these methods, Fig. 3 compares\nthe learned target posteriors on the SWI problem (which lends itself to easy visualization) with the\nground truth in 3a. We see that the KL- and W2-regularized and ensemble methods (Fig. 3b-d) do\nnot infer the correct density profile from the target data, while only our method (Fig. 3e) is able to\ninfer the correct shape. Fig. 4 shows CALNF’s prediction in the UAV problem on a held-out failure\ntrajectory after training on only one other failure trajectory (and 10 nominal trajectories). These\nresults suggests that our method is able to appropriately balance the information gained from the\nnominal distribution with the limited number of target data points.\nWe also provide the results of an ablation study in Table 8 in the supplementary material, comparing\nthe ELBO achieved when we omit the calibration step (using a constant c), omit the nominal data,\nand remove the subsampling step. These results indicate that most of the performance improvement\nfrom CALNF is due to training on random subsamples of the target data. We observe that in cases\n6\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n(a) GT mean\nNominal\nTarget\n(b) KL reg.\n(c) W2 reg.\n(e) CalNF (ours)\n(d) Ensemble\nFigure 3: Seismic waveform inversion.

The appendix includes further results on training time and the\nsensitivity of CALNF to varying K (Fig. 11), β (Fig. 12), and target dataset size Nt (Fig. 12).\n4.4\nUSING CALNF FOR ANOMALY DETECTION\nAlthough our main focus in this paper is modeling failure events, we can apply the posteriors learned\nusing our method to detect previously-unseen failures. To use CALNF for anomaly detection, we train\nthe normalizing flow and calibration label as described above, then use the ELBO L(ϕ, c∗, {x, y})\nas the score function to classify a novel datapoint {x, y}. Table 2 shows the area under the receiver\noperating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR) for this\nCALNF-based anomaly detector on the UAV and SWI problems, compared with the supervised\nanomaly detector proposed in (Gudovskiy et al., 2022; Kang et al., 2022; Rudolph et al., 2021) and\nwith hand-tuned KL- and W2-regularized variants. We were not able to test the ATC problem in this\nsetting due to a lack of data, and the 2D toy example is too simple to be informative, as all methods\nachieve near-perfect classification. Although CALNF is designed for posterior learning rather than\nanomaly detection, we find that it achieves more consistent results on this downstream task than\nexisting methods, likely due to CALNF’s resistance to overfitting.\nFigure 4: Single-shot UAV failure\ndynamics predicted by CALNF.\nTable 2: Anomaly detection performance on held-out data, re-\nporting mean and standard deviation across four seeds.\nAUROC ↑\nAUCPR ↑\nSWI\nUAV\nSWI\nUAV\nNF-AD\n0.74±0.03\n0.65±0.17\n0.77±0.03\n0.56±0.23\nNF-ADKL\n0.74±0.03\n0.74±0.09\n0.77±0.03\n0.70±0.12\nNF-ADW2\n0.65±0.03\n0.54±0.08\n0.63±0.03\n0.41±0.08\nEnsemble\n0.75±0.10\n0.5±0.0\n0.78±0.09\n0.36±0.0\nCalNF\n0.79±0.02\n0.70±0.03\n0.83±0.03\n0.66±0.04\n4.5\nCALNF FOR FEW-SHOT INFERENCE ON IMAGE DATA\nAlthough image modeling is not the focus of this work, for completeness we also include results\napplying CALNF to few-shot image generation. To use CALNF for this task, we replace the\nunderlying normalizing flow with a conditional Glow architecture (a type of normalizing flow\nspecialized for image modeling Kingma & Dhariwal (2018)), using the calibration label as the\n7\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nconditioning input. We adapt the MNIST (LeCun et al., 2010) and CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky, 2009)\ndatasets to create a nominal dataset with all training examples from a single class and a target dataset\nwith 64 examples from a second class. In this case, there is no underlying stochastic process and no\ncontext variables (i.e. we directly observe the images x ∼pθ(x|z) = δ(x −z)), and the empirical\nELBO (4) reduces to the average negative log likelihood of the training data. As a result, minimizing\nthe loss (5) learns an approximation of the training image distribution.\nEach method is trained on all examples from the nominal class and the limited set examples from\nthe target class, and we report the negative log-likelihood on held-out test data, then we measure\nthe negative log-likelihood on held-out images from the target class to test generalization beyond\nthe limited training examples. Table 3 and Fig. 6 show the results of this experiment. We find that\nCALNF is able to generalize better than either a standard or ensemble model, as measured by a higher\nlog likelihood on the held-out data\nTable 3: Log-likelihood (bits/dim) on held-out im-\nages, reporting mean and standard deviation across\nfour seeds.

Between December 21st and December 30th, 2022, a series of cascading delays and cancella-\ntions severely disrupted the Southwest network, starting in Denver and spreading across the United\nStates. The disruption occurred in roughly two stages, as shown in Fig. 13 in the appendix. In the\nfirst stage, from 12/21 to 12/24, weather and operational difficulties caused cancellations to increase\nfrom a < 5% baseline to over 50% of scheduled flights. In the second phase between 12/25 and\n12/29, Southwest flight dispatchers started preemptively canceling flights and ferrying crew between\nairports to reset the network, canceling up to 77% of scheduled flights before returning to near-normal\noperations on 12/30. Southwest ultimately canceled more than 16,000 flights, affecting more than\n2 million passengers, and the airline lost substantial revenue and later paid a $140 million penalty\nimposed by the US Department of Transportation (28% of its 2023 net income; (Rose, 2023)).\nThis incident has been the subject of extensive investigation, with a report from Southwest Air-\nlines (Southwest Airlines, 2023), testimony before the US Senate from the Southwest Airlines Pilots\nAssociation (SWAPA; (Murray, 2023)), and press coverage (Rose, 2023; Cramer & Levenson, 2022).\nThese sources propose a number of hypotheses on the root cause of the 2022 incident. While there is\nbroad agreement that winter weather was a major factor, sources differ on the role of other factors;\ne.g. the SWAPA report emphasizes poor crew management, while press coverage emphasizes the\npoint-to-point nature of the Southwest network.\nGiven this context, we have two goals for our case study. First, we are interested in identifying\nchanges in the network state that coincided with the disruption, and how those disrupted parameters\ncompare to the nominal state of the network. Second, we aim to produce a generative model of the\ndisrupted network conditions for use as a tool for network design and analysis (e.g. as a simulation\nenvironment for stress-testing future scheduling and recovery policies might).\n8\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nFigure 7: The posterior distribution of departure service times at DEN, MDW, DAL, and LAS.\nService times increased only at airports that saw severe weather (DEN, MDW, and DAL).\n5.1\nIMPLEMENTATION\nWe focus on the first four days of the scheduling crisis, prior to the wave of manual interventions\naimed at resetting the network. We conduct our analysis at two spatial resolutions, considering\nsubnetworks of the 4 and 10 busiest airports in the Southwest network, respectively. More details on\nour model are included in the appendix, along with a key for relevant airport codes in Table 6.\n5.2\nRESULTS\nLocalized delays due to winter weather.\nOur first observation confirms a common explanation for\nthe disruption: that localized delays at airports across the US coincided with winter weather. Fig. 7\nshows CALNF’s posterior estimates of nominal and disrupted service times (a proxy for taxi, deicing,\nand ATC delays) at the four busiest airports. Of these four, only those that experienced severe cold\ntemperatures (DEN, MDW, and DAL) saw an increase in average service time, while there was\nno significant increase at LAS, which did not have severe weather. This result agrees with official\naccounts that identify winter weather and a lack of deicing equipment at critical airports like DEN\nas contributing factors (Southwest Airlines, 2023; Cramer & Levenson, 2022). However, the more\nimportant question is how these localized service delays cascaded into the nationwide disruption.\nCascading failures due to aircraft flow interruption.\nOur main finding comes from modeling\nthe movement of aircraft within the network. The number of aircraft starting the day at each airport\nprovides an important measure of robustness, since if there are insufficient aircraft to meet demand,\nthen departing flights must be delayed or canceled. Aircraft deficits can also cascade through the\nnetwork, as down-stream airports are deprived of the aircraft needed to serve scheduled departures.\nBecause aircraft distribution data are not publicly available, we must use our method to infer it.\nLAS\nDAL\nMDW\nPHX\nHOU\nMCO\nBNA\nDEN\nOAK\nBWI\nRelative aircraft surplus/deﬁcit\nFigure 8: CALNF’s inferred posterior estimates of the distribution of Southwest aircraft at the\nstart of the first four days of the disruption, normalized by the number of scheduled departures at\neach airport; positive/negative indicates more/fewer aircraft than in the nominal case, respectively.\nCALNF suggests that LAS, DAL, and PHX accumulated a large aircraft deficit over the course of the\ndisruption.\n9\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nFig. 8 shows our results from using CALNF to infer the distribution of aircraft reserves in the top-10\nnetwork over each of the first four days of the disruption. CALNF finds that there was no detectable\ndeviation from the nominal aircraft distribution on the first day of the disruption, but we infer a\nsteadily increasing deficit at LAS, DAL, and PHX over the following three days. The fact that the\naircraft deficit at these airports continued to worsen may have been a factor in Southwest’s decision\nto “hard reset” the network by ferrying empty planes between airports.\nBeyond inferring these hidden parameters in the Southwest network, CALNF’s results also suggest a\npossible causal mechanism by which aircraft deficits at LAS, DAL, and PHX propagated to the rest\nof the network. Although the Southwest network is famously operated in a point-to-point manner,\naircraft typically visit multiple airports in sequence on a given day; and disruptions at any of these\nintermediate destinations can lead to “missing aircraft” at downstream nodes. For example, although\nLAS and PHX did not experience severe weather during this period, nearly 50% of aircraft ultimately\nbound for LAS or PHX pass through either DEN or MDW (which did see weather-related delays).\nOur analysis in Fig. 8 suggests that trends in aircraft reserves at key airports like LAS, PHX, and\nDAL might be valuable early warning signs for detecting future disruptions.\nGenerative modeling\nOnce we have learned the nominal and disruption posteriors for the South-\nwest network, we can use these as generative models for stress-testing proposed modifications to the\nSouthwest network or scheduling system. In future work, we hope to explore how these generative\nmodels can be used to design more resilient schedule recovery algorithms.\n6\nCONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for rare-event modeling, developing a data-constrained\nposterior inference tool that uses a subsampling and calibration strategy to avoid overfitting to\nsparse data. We apply our algorithm to failure analysis and inverse problems, achieving competitive\nperformance on a range of benchmarks with both simulated and real data. We also apply our algorithm\nto a real-world failure modeling problem, providing new insight into the factors behind the 2022\nSouthwest Airlines scheduling crisis.\nLimitations & future work\nThe primary limitation of our work is that training CALNF on\nrandomly sampled subsets of the target dataset incurs an additional training cost (as shown in Table 9\nin the appendix). Although there is no inference-time penalty, CALNF requires K + 1 evaluations of\nthe joint likelihood p(x, z; y) per training step (one for each of K subsamples and once for updating\nc∗), compared to K evaluations for the ensemble and one evaluation for the KL- and W2-regularized\nmethods. Our method also requires one additional hyperparameter than the baselines, which adds\nto implementation complexity, and it is more difficult to train in parallel than the ensemble model.\nHowever, even though CALNF is slower to train, it achieves results in the low-data regime that are not\npossible using faster methods. For example, Fig. 3 shows how our method solves a seismic imaging\nproblem that none of the competing baselines can solve, and CALNF yields better, more consistent\nperformance on downstream anomaly classification tasks. We would also like to emphasize that there\nis no additional cost for for our method at inference time, other than the negligible cost of passing the\ncalibrated label c∗as an additional input to the normalizing flow.\nA second limitation is that our method does not provide an estimate of the risk of failure. Estimating\nthe probability of failure is challenging due to the size of the dataset, but we hope that future work\nwill close this gap; e.g. providing theoretical bounds using large deviation theory (Dembo & Zeitouni,\n2010). A final limitation is that we implicitly assume that failure examples share some structure with\nnominal ones, and so learning a shared representation for both cases (as CALNF does) is helpful. If\nthe failure examples are drawn from a radically different distribution than nominal data, the implicit\nregularization from this shared representation (discussed in Theorem 1) may not be useful.\nBroader impact\nThis paper aims to provide tools to understand the causes of past failures and\nprevent future incidents. We hope that our work will help enable a more comprehensive data-driven\napproach to safety analysis for complex systems, including cyberphysical systems and complex\ninfrastructural networks. There is some potential for negative impact (e.g. a bad actor attempting to\ninfer the properties of a safety-critical system to prepare an adversarial attack), but we believe that\nthe potential benefits for designing more robust systems outweigh these concerns.\n10\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nREPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT\nWe include source code for all experiments in a zip file in our supplementary materials, including\nREADME files with instructions for installing all required dependencies and scripts for recreating all\nexperimental results reported in this paper, including all hyperparameters and random seeds used.\nWe also provide an open-source implementation of our algorithm and air traffic simulator at https:\n//github.com/dawsonc/BayesAir.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was partly supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) ULI\ngrant 80NSSC22M0070, Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) grant FA9550-23-1-0099,\nand the MIT-DSTA program.

The conditional inverse autoregressive flow (IAF; (Kingma et al., 2016)) has Lipschitz\nconstant L ≤Q\ni\nQ\nt(Lst + Lmt), where the outer product is over autoregressive blocks and the\ninner product is over steps within each autoregressive block. Lst and Lst are the Lipschitz constants\nof the neural networks yielding the mt and st values for each autoregressive step (these can be\neasily bounded for most neural networks; e.g. by the product of the L2 matrix norms of the weight\nmatrices; (Miyato et al., 2018)).\n14\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nRemark 2. A neural spline flow (Durkan et al., 2019) has Lipschitz constant L ≤2¯s, where ¯s is an\nupper bound on the slope s = (yk+1 −y)/(xk+1 −xk) between adjacent knot points of the spline\n(this can be constrained by construction by ensuring a minimum spline bin width).\nRemark 3. Continuous normalizing flows (Chen et al., 2018) have Lipschitz constant L ≤eLg∆t\nwhere ∆t is the duration of integration and Lg is the Lipschitz constant of the neural network defining\nthe vector field of the flow.\nRemark 4 (from (Verine et al., 2023)). Normalizing flows based on invertible residual networks, such\nas i-ResNet (Behrmann et al., 2019) and Residual Flow (Chen et al., 2019), have Lipschitz constant\nL ≤(1 + Lg)m, where m is the number of residual blocks and Lg < 1 is the Lipschitz constant of\nthe residual block g(x).\nRemark 5 (from (Verine et al., 2023)). Normalizing flows based on Glow (Kingma & Dhariwal,\n2018) have Lipschitz constant L ≤Q ∥Wi∥2, where the product is over the weight matrices Wi of\nthe convolution blocks.\nB\nPROOF OF LEMMA 1\nProof. The optimal maximum likelihood estimator is a mixture of delta functions q∗(z) =\nP\nz(i)∈D δ(z −z(i))/N. Since we assume that the data points are well-separated, the optimal\nL-Lipschitz maximum likelihood estimator replaces the scaled delta δ(z)/N with the L-Lipschitz\nfunction ˆδ(z) that a) is non-negative, b) integrates to 1/N, and c) maximizes the value ˆδ(0). Con-\nstraint (c) will be active (otherwise we recover the scaled delta function), so we know that ˆδ will have\nthe form max(0, a −L||z||). Normalizing to 1/N yields\nˆδ(z) = max (0, a −L|z|)\n(6)\na =\n \n(d + 1)LdΓ( d\n2 + 1)\nπd/2N\n!1/(d+1)\n(7)\nSubstituting one data point for another (subject to the assumption on data sparsity) changes the\noptimal estimator by swapping the corresponding mixture component; i.e. exchanging ˆδ(z −z(2))\nfor ˆδ(z −z(1)). The W2 distance between the resulting mixtures is the same as the W2 distance\nbetween the changed components. Each component has probability mass 1/N and they are distance\n||z(1) −z(2)|| apart, completing the proof.\nC\nPROOF OF LEMMA 2\nProof. Let Di be a random dataset created by sampling D N times with replacement. In the proof\nof Lemma 1, we show that the optimal L-Lipschitz maximum likelihood estimator given Di is\nP\nz∈Di ˆδ(z −z(i)). This gives ensemble model\nqensemble(z) =\nK\nX\ni=1\n\" X\nz∈Di\nˆδ(z −z(i))\n#\n/K\n(8)\nSince each Di is sampled independently with replacement, we can combine the nested sums\nqensemble(z) =\nX\nz(i)∈DNK\nˆδ(z −z(i))/K\n(9)\nwhere DNK is a single dataset of NK points sampled with replacement from D. As K →∞, the\nempirical distribution of DNK approaches that of D, so this sum reduces almost surely to:\nlim\nK→∞qensemble(z)\na.s.\n=\nX\nz(i)∈D\nˆδ(z −z(i))\n(10)\n15\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nD\nPROOF OF THEOREM 1\nProof. The W2 metric is defined as an infemum over couplings γ, so in order to provide an upper\nbound it suffices to propose a coupling between the nominal and target posteriors, qϕ(z, 0K) and\nqϕ(z, c∗). Recall that the normalizing flow qϕ has base distribution q0 and flow map fϕ, where fϕ(z, c)\nis assumed to be L-Lipschitz in the second argument. Consider the joint distribution γ(z1, z2) defined\nby z0 ∼q0(z), z1 = fϕ(z0, 0K), and z2 = fϕ(z0, c∗). By construction, the marginals of γ in each\nargument are qϕ(z, 0K) and qϕ(z, c∗), respectively, and so γ is a valid coupling.\nThis provides the bound\nW2(qϕ(·, 0K), qϕ(·, c∗)) ≤\n\u0014\nE\nz1,z2∼γ ||z1 −z2||2\n\u00151/2\n≤\n\u0002\nL2||c∗−0K||2\u00031/2\n≤L||c∗||\nE\nDETAILS ON BENCHMARK PROBLEMS\nThis section provides additional details for the three types of inverse problem studied in our paper.\nAll problems are implemented using the Pyro probabilistic programming framework (Bingham et al.,\n2019).\nE.1\nSEISMIC WAVEFORM INVERSION\nAn illustration of the SWI problem is given in Fig. 9. We implement the SWI problem using\nthe Deepwave library (Richardson, 2023). We use latent parameters z ∈Rnx×ny representing\nthe subsurface density profile (with spatial resolution nx = 10 and ny = 10), context y ∈RnT\nrepresenting the source signal, and observations x ∈Rns×nr×nT representing the signal measured at\neach receiver, where ns = 1, nr = 9, nT = 100 are the number of sources, receivers, and timesteps,\nrespectively. Before solving the elastic wave PDE, the density profile is upsampled to 100 × 30. The\nobservations are corrupted with additive isotropic Gaussian noise. The parameters of this problem\nare summarized in Table 4.\nReceivers\nSource\nFigure 9: (Left) An illustration of the SWI problem and (right) the receiver measurements (blue)\ngiven a source signal (black).\nE.2\nUAV CONTROL\nWe model the nonlinear attitude dynamics of the UAV as a combination of an unknown linear mapping\nfrom the current and desired states to angular rates, then a nonlinear mapping from angular rates to\nupdated UAV orientation. The state q = [ϕ, θ, ψ] includes the roll, pitch, and yaw angles of the UAV,\n16\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nTable 4: Summary of parameters for the SWI problem.\nDimension\nLatent parameters z\nDensity profile (10 × 10)\n100\nContext y\n—\nObservation x\nSeismic waveform (100 timesteps at 9 receivers)\n900\nand ˆq denotes the commanded orientation.

A summary of the parameters for\nthis problem are given in Table 5.\nAn example trajectory, including both nominal and anomalous segments, for the UAV dataset are\nshown in Fig. 10. In this case, the anomaly is relatively easy to detect; the challenge is understanding\nhow the aircraft’s flight dynamics change during the failure so that a recovery controller can be\ndesigned to handle this case.\nFigure 10: Example trajectory that includes an elevator failure, including both nominal and anomalous\nsegments.\n17\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nTable 5: Summary of parameters for the UAV problem.\nDimension\nLatent parameters z\nFeedforward matrix A (3 × 3)\n9\nFeedback matrix K (3 × 3)\n9\nBias term d\n3\nContext y\nCurrent state\n3\nDesired orientation\n3\nObservation x\nNext state\n3\nE.3\nAIR TRAFFIC NETWORK\nThe input to our air traffic model is a list of scheduled flights, each specifying an origin and destination\nairport and a scheduled departure and arrival time. The latent state z includes the mean travel time\nbetween each origin/destination pair, the mean service time at each airport (which affects both arriving\nand departing aircraft and models taxi, deicing, and ATC delays), the mean turnaround time at each\nairport (the minimum time that must elapse before an arriving aircraft may depart), the baseline\ncancellation rate at each airport, and the initial number of aircraft at each airport. A summary of these\nparameters are given in Table 7. So that the benchmarks in Section 4 can be run in a reasonable time,\nwe restrict the ATC problem used for benchmarking to the four busiest airports and do not model\ncancellations, but we use the ten busiest airports and do include cancellations in our case study in\nSection 5.\nThe model steps through the scheduled flights in 15 minute increments. In each increment, it checks\nfor the flights that are scheduled to depart from each airport. Each of these flights receives a certain\nprobability of cancellation given by\nP(canceled) = 1 −(1 −pc)σ\n\u0012\n10\n# available aircraft\n# departing flights in this block\n\u0013\n(14)\nwhere pc is the baseline cancellation rate for the origin airport and σ is the sigmoid function, so the\nprobability of cancellation is pc when there are more available aircraft than scheduled departures and\napproaches 1 as the number of available aircraft decreases. Cancellations are sampled from a relaxed\nBernoulli distribution with this cancellation probability and a straight-through gradient estimator. If a\nflight is canceled, it is marked as such and the observation for that flight will just be canceled and\nwill not include actual departure and arrival times. If the flight is not canceled, then it is moved to the\nrunway queue if there are enough aircraft available; otherwise, it is delayed until the next time block.\nBoth departing and arriving flights are served using a single M/M/1 queue for each airport, with\nservice times drawn from an exponential distribution with the mean specified according to each\nairport’s mean service time. Once airborne, departing flights are assigned a random flight time from a\nGaussian with mean given by the mean travel time for each route and fixed variance. Once this travel\ntime has elapsed, they enter the runway queue at the destination airport. Once an aircraft has landed,\nit does not become available to serve new flights until the minimum turnaround time has elapsed\n(which is sampled from a Gaussian with mean given by the mean turnaround time for each airport).\nObservations for non-canceled flights include the simulated arrival and departure times, plus some\nfixed-variance Gaussian noise.\nE.4\nTOY 2D PROBLEM\nThe data for the 2D toy problem is generated by uniformly sampling nominal data:\nθ ∼U(0, π)\nx ∼N(cos θ −0.5, 0.1)\ny ∼N(sin θ −0.25, 0.1)\n18\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nTable 6: International Air Transport Association (IATA) codes and full names of the ten busiest\nairports in the Southwest network.\nDEN\nDenver International Airport\nDAL\nDallas Love Field Airport\nMDW\nChicago Midway International Airport\nPHX\nPhoenix Sky Harbor International Airport\nHOU\nWilliam P.

We note that CALNF is agnostic to the underlying flow architecture; we also tried\nusing masked autoregressive flows (Huang et al., 2018), which trained faster but had slightly worse\nperformance, and continuous normalizing flows (Chen et al., 2018), which trained much more slowly.\nWe implement the KL regularization baseline using neural spline flows with a KL regularization\npenalty between the learned anomaly and nominal posteriors. We implement an RNODE-derived\nmethod that includes only the W2 regularization term, not the Froebenius norm regularization term\n19\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n(which is used only to speed training and inference, not to regularize the learned posterior; (Finlay\net al., 2020)).\nWe extend our method to anomaly detection by defining a score function as the ELBO of a given\nobservation, approximated using 10 samples from the learned posterior.\nAll methods were implemented in Pytorch using the Zuko library for normalizing flows (Zuk, 2024).\nThe neural spline flows used 3 stacked transforms, and all flows used two hidden layers of 64 units\neach with ReLU activation (except for the continuous flows on the 2D problem, which use two\nhidden layers of 128 units each). All flows were trained using the Adam optimizer with the learning\nrate 10−3 (except on the UAV problem, which used a learning rate of 10−2) and gradient clipping.\nCALNF used K = 5 on all problems. All methods were trained on either a single NVIDIA GeForce\nRTX 2080 Ti GPU or a g4dn.xlarge AWS instance, with 200, 500, 500, and 150 epochs for\nthe 2D, SWI, UAV, and ATC problems, respectively. The image generation examples were trained\nfor 1000 epochs (MNIST) and 500 epochs (CIFAR-10). Non-image benchmarks all take less than\n2 hours to train, and image benchmarks take approximately 20 hours to train. We estimate cloud\ncompute costs for this entire project (including preliminary experiments) at less than 200 USD.\nCode examples, including scripts for reproducing the results in Tables 1 and 8 and notebooks\ncontaining our data analysis for Section 5, are included in the attached supplementary material.\nAn open-source version of our algorithm and air traffic network simulator is available at https:\n//github.com/dawsonc/BayesAir.\nG\nFURTHER EMPIRICAL RESULTS\nTable 8: ELBO (nats/dim) on held-out target data for ablations of CALNF.

The inference times are identical except for\nthe W2-regularized method, which is slower due to its use of neural ODEs for the flow map).\nFig. 12 show the performance of CALNF on the 2D benchmark as the number of target data points\nis decreased. When the size of the target dataset is at least 10% the size of the nominal dataset,\nCALNF’s test-set ELBO saturates at a high value. Between 2% and 5%, CALNF’s performance\nbegins to deteriorate, and below 2% performance drops off sharply. Higher values of β improve\nperformance in extremely data-sparse cases, but decrease performance when many target data points\nare available. This example uses 1000 nominal data points; the results in our main paper use β = 1.0\n(constant across all experiments) and a target dataset 2% of the size of the nominal dataset for this\nproblem.\nFrom the results in Fig. 12, we see that larger values of β perform better when the failure dataset\nis very small, but smaller values of β perform better when the failure dataset is large. These results\nsuggest that when plenty of information is available (in the form of a large training dataset), it\nis beneficial to encourage diversity among the candidate posteriors through a small regularization\nstrength β; however, when information is limited, we can achieve better performance by encouraging\nsimilarity between candidate posteriors to reduce overfitting.\nFigure 12: Performance of CALNF under extreme data scarcity on the 2D benchmark, with varying\nself-regularization strengths β.\n21\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nTable 10: ELBO (nats/dim) on held-out anomaly data of the ensemble baseline trained without\nnominal data.
