In this study, we investigated phase transition engineering in Ag \nelectrodes via Cu and Zn alloying, transforming from a cubic to a tetragonal phase. These \nalloyed electrodes are then thermally deposited as back electrodes in perovskite solar cells. We \nconducted a comprehensive analysis of the pure Ag and Ag-Cu-Zn alloys deposited atop a hole-\ntransport layer for use in Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3-based solar cells. Our findings \nreveal that solar cells developed with pure Ag electrodes demonstrate a power conversion \nefficiency (PCE) of 18.71%, characterized by a fill factor (FF) of 74.8%, an open-circuit voltage \n(VOC) of 1.08 V, and a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.17 mA/cm². Conversely, solar \ncells fabricated with optimized Ag0.875Cu0.120Zn0.005 electrodes exhibit enhanced performance \nmetrics, with an FF of 72.5%, VOC of 1.12 V, and JSC of 23.39 mA/cm², culminating in an \nelevated PCE of 19.02%. Moreover, this electrode demonstrates remarkable durability, \nsustaining operational integrity for 460 hours for the PSCs stored in N2 glove box, in contrast \nto the 320 hours for cells with Ag electrodes. The Ag-Cu-Zn alloys exhibited high resistance to \ncorrosion and good adhesion on the hole-transport material layer compared to a layer of Ag. \nThese advancements may lead to the realization of cost-effective, durable, and efficient solar \nenergy conversion systems. \n1. Introduction \nPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently been demonstrated as potential candidates for the \nnext generation of green and renewable energy conversion due to their low material and \nmanufacturing cost, scalable fabrication capability, and very high efficiency achieved[1,2]. The \nlong-term stability of perovskite materials is still a major challenge for commercialization[3,4]. \nFactors such as heat, oxygen and moisture lead to degradation of the perovskite materials and \nhave garnered significant attention from researchers due to their significant impact on the \nstability and longevity of perovskite-based devices[5,6]. Additionally, there is growing attention \ntowards understanding the mechanisms behind the reduced stability of perovskite solar cells, \nparticularly due to ion migration between the electrode and the perovskite layer[7,8]. \nThe metals with suitable work function and conductivity have been chosen as electrodes in \nPSCs. The metallic layers of Al, Au, Cu and Ag have been reported to be used regularly for \nback-contact electrodes in PSCs. Properties of different materials, interfaces, and morphology \nof the electrodes influence the overall device performance. Al is not a preferred material for \nPSCs due to its susceptibility to corrosion and oxidation[9,10]. Al may also react with degradation \nproducts of the perovskite layer producing organo-aluminum compounds or alternatively anion \nradicals. These compounds can easily react with any proton donor present (e.g.  a trace of water \nor with oxygen)[11].  Ag electrode is broadly used in the PSCs, but its reactive and corrosive \nnature with perovskite consistently induces the critical stability issue[12,13].  As well, Ag atoms \n\n\n \n \n2 \n \ndiffuse into the perovskite layer, they can accelerate the reaction with iodine species, and induce \nthe deep level defects in the perovskite layer[14,15]. Cu is a more appropriate electrode material \nfor higher stability of PSCs than conventional Al and Ag electrodes. Cu has been observed to \ndiffuse into and react with the perovskite layer, and the infrared and ultraviolet contents in the \nsunlight accelerate the photo-oxidation and chemical reaction between Cu and the perovskite \nlayer[10,16].  Therefore, Au has been considered a logical choice of the electrode as it inherently \nprovides  resistance to environmental oxidation and appears also to be resistant to metal–halide \nformation, however diffusion of Au into the perovskite active layer can induce deep traps, \nleading to a degradation in performance[10,17,18]. Au is a relatively expensive material, which \ncan increase the overall cost of PSCs, making them less economically viable for large-scale \nproduction[19]. In this study, we present the incorporation of Ag-Cu-Zn alloy compositions, \nencompassing variants of Ag0.875Cu0.125Zn0.000, Ag0.875Cu0.120Zn0.005, and Ag0.875Cu0.115Zn0.010, \nas novel electrode materials. These alloys show excellent thermal and electrical conductivity \nand good reflectivity of light and present a cost-effective alternative to other precious electrode \nmetals. Ag-Cu-Zn alloy based back electrodes are less corrosive and less diffusive relative to \nAg electrodes and reduce the device degradation in the unencapsulated PSCs under ambient \nconditions.  \nIn this work, we report the innovative demonstration of thermal evaporation processing of Ag-\nCu-Zn alloy as a novel back electrode material for high-efficiency and long-term stable \nCs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3-based PSCs. The PSCs fabricated with Ag and Ag-Cu-\nZn electrodes are stored in the dark under ambient air conditions. Notably, PSCs with Ag \nelectrodes exhibit degradation with time, which is attributed to Ag corrosion, as evidenced by \nthe formation of silver iodide (AgI) confirmed through XRD and XPS analysis. In contrast, \nalloying Ag with Cu and Zn significantly reduce the corrosion rate of the electrodes, minimizes \nthe diffusion of Ag atoms into the perovskite layer, and consequently enhances device stability.  \n2. Experimental Section \nFigure 1 illustrates the schematic representation of the fabrication process of the Ag-Cu-Zn \nalloy back electrodes via the melt quenching technique followed by thermal evaporation. To \nprepare the Ag-Cu-Zn alloys, the appropriate amounts of Ag, Cu, and Zn powders were grinded, \nas described in Table S1 provided in the supporting information and then transferred into \ncleaned and flat quartz ampoules. The ampoules were subsequently sealed under a vacuum of \n10-6 mbar and loaded into a resistive furnace. The furnace temperature was initially ramped to \n350 °C and maintained for 3 hours, followed by a gradual increase to 700 °C. After a 3-hour \nisothermal hold at 700 °C, the temperature was further elevated to 1050 °C. To ensure sample \nhomogeneity, the ampoules were continuously rocked throughout the process. Following a 12-\nhour dwell at 1050 °C, the temperature was reduced to 800 °C, and the melt was rapidly \nquenched in an ice-water bath. Post-quenching, the Ag-Cu-Zn alloys were annealed at 250 °C \nto relieve stress and improve homogenization. \nTo fabricate the PSCs, the precursor solutions of SnO2, Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 \n(abbreviated as CsFAMA), and spiro-OMeTAD were prepared for the deposition of the electron \ntransport layer (ETL), active layer, and hole transport layer (HTL), respectively. The detailed \nprocedures for preparing these precursor solutions are outlined in the Methods section of the \nsupporting information. The step-by-step fabrication process utilized for the preparation of \nPSCs is illustrated in the schematic diagram presented in Figure S1. \nAfter optimization, when silver alloying with copper and Zinc, the composition of \nAg0.875Cu0.120Zn0.005 emerged as the most efficacious electrode material for PSCs. This alloy \n\n\n \n \n3 \n \nand its corresponding thin film/device are denoted as ACZ0.5/target, while fine silver serves as \nAg/control.  \n \nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of the fabrication of Ag-Cu-Zn alloy back electrodes. \n3. Results and Discussion \nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of both Ag and ACZ0.5 thin films were subjected to \nanalysis using the pseudo-Voigt function through the Rietveld refinement method. The Rietveld \nrefinement results for both thin films are depicted in Figure 2a,b. The results of the refinement \nfor fine silver confirm a face-centered cubic structure with a space group Fm-3m (No. 225) and \nunit cell parameters a=b=c=4.09 Å. In contrast, ACZ0.5 exhibits a crystalline structure with a \ntetragonal symmetry, characterized by a space group P4/mmm (No. 123) and lattice parameters \na=b=4.074 Å and c=8.148 Å, respectively. The observed peaks align well with the standard \nfiles and reported theoretical results[20]. The refinement outcomes, including reliability factors \nRP, RwP, Goodness of Fitting (GOF), R Bragg, χ2, RF, and lattice parameters for both samples, \nare summarized and tabulated in Table S2. Peak shifting and broadening can be seen in Ag thin \nfilms when alloyed with Cu and Zn (refer to Figure S2) and the corresponding crystal structures \nare illustrated in Figure S3. \nThe electronic structure and surface chemical compositions of Ag and the ACZ0.5 alloy were \ncharacterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS full survey of ACZ0.5 \nconfirms the presence of Ag, Cu and Zn elements (refer to Figure S4). The high-resolution \nXPS spectrum of Ag 3d illustrated in Figure 2c shows that ACZ0.5 comprises two distinct \npeaks at approximately 367 and 375 eV, corresponding to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, respectively. \nThe separation between these peaks is calculated to be 8.0 eV, confirming the Ag0 state[21]. The \nhigh-resolution XPS spectrum of Cu 2p depicted in Figure 2d shows that ACZ0.5 contains two \ndistinct peaks at approximately 933 and 953 eV, corresponding to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, \nrespectively. The separation between the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 peak is calculated to be 20.0 eV, \nwhich confirm the Cu0 state[22,23]. The high-resolution XPS of Zn 2p exhibits double peaks \nlocated at the binding energy of 1021 and 1045 eV with a spin–orbit splitting energy of 24 eV, \ncorresponding to the Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2, respectively, as shown in Figure 2e. The Zn 2p3/2 \npeak can be deconvoluted into two peaks centered at 1021 and 1022 eV, which can be assigned \nto Zn0 and Zn2+, respectively. Similarly, the Zn 2p1/2 peak can be deconvoluted into two peaks \ncentered at 1045 eV and 1046 eV[24,25]. The O 1s spectrum of ACZ0.5 alloy can be deconvoluted \ninto two peaks, as illustrated in Figure 2f, corresponding to the binding energy of Zn-O (530 \n\n\n \n \n4 \n \neV) and Zn-OH (532.5 eV) [25,26]. The formation of ZnO on the ACZ0.5 surface enhances the \ncorrosion resistance of the electrode. Raman spectra of Ag and its alloys also confirm the \nformation of ZnO on the surface (refer to Figure S5). The atomic ratio of Ag/Cu was calculated \nto be 6.9, which is close to the stoichiometric value, while the atomic concentration of Zn \ndecreases with depth. \n \nFigure 2.

In an ideal scenario, \nKPFM quantifies the Contact Potential Difference (CPD) between the metallic Atomic Force \nMicroscopy (AFM) tip and the sample, expressed by the relation[27]:  \nVCPD = (𝛷tip −𝛷sample) ⁄ e−                                                (1) \nHere, Φtip and Φsample denote the work functions of the sample and the tip, respectively, and e- \nrepresents the elementary charge. Figures 3a-f show the KPFM images, CPD profiles and \ncorresponding morphological mapping, including height profiles, for Highly Oriented Pyrolytic \nGraphite (HOPG), Ag, and ACZ0.5 alloy. To illustrate the work function, a Nanosensors PtIr-\nPPP-EFM probe, resonating at ca. 65.7 kHz, was employed to obtain CPD and corresponding \nmorphological mapping over each sample. HOPG was employed for the calibration of the tip \nwork function. The CPD of HOPG was determined to be 299 mV, as illustrated in Figure 3a, \nand the work function of HOPG was previously reported to be ~4.6 eV under environmental \nconditions, as cited in the preceding literature[27–29]. The absolute surface work function of the \nsample was calculated with the following equation[27]: \n𝛷sample = 4.6 eV + 𝑒−(𝑉CPDHOPG −𝑉CPDsample)                                (2) \n\n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nFigure 3. KPFM images and CPD profiles (a) HOPG, (b) Ag, and (c) ACZ0.5 alloy. AFM \nimage and height profiles of (d) HOPG, (e) Ag, and (f) ACZ0.5 alloy. EPMA analysis of \nACZ1.0 alloy sample on glass substrate: WDS mapping images showing elemental distribution: \n(g) Ag, (h) Cu, and (i) Zn.  \nWith the above information, the work function of the tip was calculated to be Φtip = 4.899 eV. \nThis value is consistent with previous reports[27]. The CPD values for Ag and ACZ0.5 alloy \nwere measured at 227 mV and 99 mV, as depicted in Figure 3b,c. Using Φtip and CPD values, \nthe work function values of fine silver and ACZ0.5 alloy were calculated to be ΦAg = 4.67 eV \nand ΦACZ0.5 = 4.80 eV, respectively. These values of work function are consistent with UPS \nanalysis (refer to Figure S6). Surface morphology images obtained through AFM for HOPG, \nAg, and ACZ0.5 alloy are shown in Figure 3d-f, respectively. Both Ag and ACZ0.5 alloy thin \nfilms exhibit similar morphologies, with roughness measurements of 1.3 nm and 1.4 nm, \nrespectively (refer to Figure S7).  \nElectron probe microanalysis (EPMA) was conducted to analyze the elemental distribution in \nthe alloy sample. The EPMA mapping results of ACZ1.0 in at% are shown in Figure 3g-i, and \ncorresponding area of map back-scattered electron (BSE) and secondary electron (SE) are \nshown in Figure S8. EPMA mapping indicates that the distributions of Ag, Cu, and Zn are \nuniform. The overall atomic fractions of Ag, Cu and Zn in the ACZ1.0 alloy were measured to \n\n\n \n \n6 \n \nbe 0.8625, 0.1256, and 0.0119, respectively, which is consistent with the theoretical \ncomposition of the ACZ1.0 alloy. These findings confirm that the alloy predominantly consists \nof a single phase. \nTo study of the moisture-induced degradation of electrodes with time, devices with architecture \nFTO/SnO2/CsFAMA/spiro-OMeTAD/electrode were fabricated as described in the Methods in \nthe supporting information. For this analysis, Ag and ACZ0.5 electrodes with precisely \ncontrolled thicknesses of approximately 8 nm (for XPS analysis) and 100 nm (for XRD \nanalysis) were deposited via thermal evaporation. We measured XRD and XPS for both the \nfreshly prepared samples and those subjected to aging for specific durations at a relative \nhumidity of 40% in the ambient air. The measurements were performed from the top electrode \nside to discern any alterations in the structural and chemical characteristics of the control and \ntarget devices, as illustrated in Figure 4a. \n \nFigure 4. (a) Schematic structure of the device with Ag/ACZ0.5 electrode, (b) XRD patterns \nof the device with Ag (control) electrode up to 90 days, (c) XRD patterns of the device with \nACZ0.05 (target) electrode up to 90 days, (d) Ag 3d XPS spectrum of the device with Ag \n(control) electrode up to 30 days, (e) Ag 3d XPS spectrum of the device with ACZ0.5 (target) \nelectrode up to 30 days, and (f) Cu 2p spectrum of the device with ACZ0.5 (target) electrode \nup to 30 days. \nXRD patterns exhibit variation as a function of time (see Figure 4b,c). Initially, it consisted of \ncombining XRD patterns from FTO, CsFAMA, Ag and ACZ0.5 for both control and target \ndevices (refer to Figure S9a,c, and Figure 2a,b). As time progressed, notable changes in the \nXRD patterns were observed, suggesting evolving structural characteristics within the \nCsFAMA film and electrodes. After 30 days, the control device stored in ambient air showed \nXRD peaks at 12.65, 25.55, 38.67 and 52.48°, which correspond to the crystallographic planes \nof PbI2, specifically (001), (002), (003) and (004), respectively (refer to Figure S9d). \n\n\n \n \n7 \n \nAdditionally, a peak at 23.80° was observed, which was indexed to the (002) crystallographic \nplane of AgI. Notably, this peak persisted with two new peaks at 22.68 and 39.46° in the XRD \npattern of the control device even after an extended storage period of 90 days in ambient \nair[12,21,30–32]. These peaks can be assigned to the (100) and (110) crystallographic plane of AgI, \nrespectively. Furthermore, one additional peak appeared at 11.32° after storage period of 90 \ndays, which corresponds to the (002) crystallographic planes of CsPb2Br5[33]. Similarly, the \nXRD analysis of the target device, stored under the same conditions, revealed the presence of \nidentical XRD peaks with storage period. Interestingly, no AgI peaks were seen after 30 days \nof storage. However, after 90 days, all three AgI peaks appeared. This observation suggests that \nthe ACZ0.5 alloy electrode exhibits enhanced stability compared to the Ag electrode.  \nOn the other hand, the fresh devices (FTO/SnO2/CsFAMA/spiro-OMeTAD/electrode) did not \nexhibit any discernible peaks corresponding to AgI (see Figure 4b,c). Both control and target \ndevices show notable peaks at 38.12 and 38.19˚, respectively, attributed to Ag (111) and \nACZ0.5 (112) crystallographic plane[12,32]. These peaks were observed continuously in both \ndevices stored for a period of 90 days at a relative humidity of 40% in ambient air. This \nobservation confirms that Ag was not converted completely to AgI after a storage period of 90 \ndays. \nTo investigate the degradation mechanism of electrodes over time, XPS analysis was conducted \non both devices for a duration of 30 days, as depicted in Figure 4d,e,f. Relatively a large amount \nof iodine and bromine were detected after storage period of 15 days and 30 days, respectively, \nin both control and target device (refer to Figure S12). This phenomenon is likely attributed to \nthe presence of pinholes in the spiro-OMeTAD films, enabling the detection of the underlying \nexposed perovskite layer. The Ag 3d XPS spectrum of fresh control device revealed two distinct \nand well-resolved peaks at 368.3 eV and 374.3 eV for Ag 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively (see \nFigure 4d). No noticeable peak shifting in Ag 3d XPS spectrum of fresh target device was \nobserved, as shown in Figure 4e. Additionally, the XPS spectrum of Cu 2p exhibited two \nprominent peaks at 952.8 eV and 933.0 eV for Cu 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively, with a separation \nof 19.8 eV between them (see Figure 4f). After storage period of 15 days, a notable observation \nwas made in the control device. The Ag 3d peaks clearly shift from a metallic state to a lower \nbinding energy. This shift is characteristic of the formation of AgI, as illustrated in Figure 4d. \nInterestingly, a similar shifting phenomenon in the target device was observed, but it occurred \nafter storage period of 30 days rather than 15 days, as depicted in Figure 4e. Further, a metallic \nto lower binding energy shifting in Cu 2p peaks was observed after a storage period of 30 days, \nwhich is the characteristics of CuI, as shown in Figure 4f. The formation of CuI at the spiro-\nOMeTAD/electrode interface facilitates hole transport[34,35]. These findings also confirm that \nACZ0.5 electrode is highly stable compared to Ag electrode. \nXRD and XPS analysis reveals that device degradation occurs in a two-step process. In the first \nstep, the CsFAMA layer undergoes degradation upon reacting with moisture, which penetrates \nthrough the pinholes present in the spiro-OMeTAD layer. During the second step, the degraded \nconstituents of CsFAMA, specifically PbI2, migrate through the spiro-OMeTAD layer and \nsubsequently react with Ag, leading to the formation of AgI through a diffusion process. The \nconceptual model of degradation of Ag electrode deposited on the FTO/SnO2/CsFAMA/spiro-\nOMeTAD is illustrated in Figure S13. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \nimages of the back electrodes of both the control and target devices, collected after 30 days, \nshow that the Ag electrode degrades more rapidly compared to the ACZ0.5 electrode (refer to \nFigure S14). This confirms that the ACZ0.5 electrode is more stable than the Ag electrode.  \n\n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nFigure 5. (a) Cross-sectional SEM image of PSCs, (b) Dark J–V characteristics of the control \nand target devices, (c) illuminated J–V measurement of control and target devices with reverse \nscan, (d) EQE and integrated current density curves, (e) the statistical distribution of the PCE \nand (f) stability measurements of control and target devices in the environment of 40 ± 5% \nhumidity (bottom) and which stored in N2 glove box (top). \nWe fabricated planar n–i–p  PSCs with configuration FTO/SnO2/CsFAMA/spiro-\nOMeTAD/electrode. Figure 5a shows a cross-sectional FE-SEM image of the PSC prepared \nby the solvent engineering method with CsFAMA as an active layer, SnO2 as an ETL and spiro-\nOMeTAD as an HTL. The PSC consisted of a uniform layer of SnO2 (~45 nm in thickness), a \nuniformly deposited CsFAMA layer (~340 nm in thickness) and a uniform layer of spiro-\nOMeTAD (~200 nm in thickness). We prepared PSCs with Ag and ACZ0.5 as a back electrode \n(~95 nm thick) for the control and target device, respectively. SEM image, absorption spectra, \nsteady-state photoluminescence spectra, and time-resolved photoluminescence profiles of \nCsFAMA thin film are shown in Figure S11. The energy band diagram of the PSCs is shown \nin Figure S15[36,37]. \nDark current-voltage characteristics, as illustrated in Figure 5b, were used to investigate the \neffect of the spiro-OMeTAD/electrode interface on the recombination nature in the device. The \ntarget device shows a lower leakage current (6.3 × 10−6 mA/cm2) than the Ag electrode-based \ndevice (3.3 × 10−5 mA/cm2) indicating the degraded recombination at the spiro-OMeTAD/Ag \ninterface[38,39].  The reduction in leakage current observed in the target device can be attributed \nto improved chemical stability, better adhesion, and reduced diffusion of silver ions into the \nperovskite layer. In Figure 5c, the photocurrent density-voltage (J–V) characteristics of the \nPSCs fabricated with the ACZ0.5 electrode as target device are compared with those of the \ncontrol device prepared with the Ag electrode. As shown in the J–V curves, the target device \nexhibited an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.12 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.39 \nmA/cm2, and a fill factor (FF) of 72.5%, giving an maximum PCE of 19.02%, whereas the \ncontrol device showed an overall PCE of 18.71% with a VOC of 1.08 V, a JSC of 23.17 mA/cm2, \nand a FF of 74.8%. The superior performance of the target device is mainly attributed to a \nhigher VOC, which is associated with beneficial effects such as electronic structure modification \nand chemical stability of the ACZ0.5 electrode. The lower FF of the target device may be \nattributed to the higher sheet resistance (0.012 ohm/sq for Ag and 0.425 ohm/sq for ACZ0.5) \n\n\n \n \n9 \n \nof the ACZ0.5 electrode compared to the Ag electrode. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) \nof the control and target devices was tested, as shown in Figure 5d. The results reveal that the \ntarget device shows a good optical response with a higher EQE and an integrated current density \nof 21.78 mA/cm2, while the control device exhibits an integrated current density of 21.30 \nmA/cm2. The statistical distribution diagram of the PCE of the PSCs is shown in Figure 5e and \nthe J–V data of 28 devices is shown in Table S3, and the PCE results exhibit that the PSCs with \nACZ0.5 electrodes show good reproducibility and better photovoltaic performance. Time-\nstability plots of the PSCs are shown in Figure 5f. The control device, stored in the environment \nof 40 ± 5% humidity loses 20% of its efficiency after 180 hours, whereas the target device takes \n310 hours to experience the same level of efficiency loss. The PCE of  the control device, stored \nin the N2 glove box, decreases to 80% of its initial value after 320 hours, while the PCE of the \ntarget device retains over 80% of its initial value after 460 h. These findings indicate that the \ntarget device exhibits superior stability, particularly in terms of moisture stability. \n4. Conclusions \nThe ACZ0.5 alloy-based back electrode demonstrates remarkable potential for use in PSCs due \nto its excellent chemical stability, good reflectivity of light, and high adhesion on the hole \ntransport layer. Our findings demonstrate that PSCs incorporating the ACZ0.5 alloy electrode \nexhibit significantly enhanced durability compared to those utilizing Ag metal electrodes, \nparticularly in unencapsulated devices. Additionally, these cells achieve high efficiency, and a \nlarger open-circuit voltage than traditional Ag electrodes. These attributes make the ACZ0.5 \nalloy-based electrode a promising candidate for photovoltaic applications, paving the way for \nmore reliable, cost-effective and efficient solar energy solutions. Further research and \ndevelopment could enhance its performance and broaden its applicability in the renewable \nenergy sector. \nSupporting Information.  \nSupporting Information is available with this paper. \nCorresponding Author \nRamesh Karuppannan – Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), \nBangalore 560012, Karnataka, India;  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8304-6500; Email: \nkramesh@iisc.ac.in  \nAuthors \nKeshav Kumar Sharma – Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore \n560012, Karnataka, India; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6753-2269  \nAshutosh Ujjwal – Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore \n560012, Karnataka, India; https://orcid.org/0009-0001-7786-4179  \nRohit Saini – Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore 560012, \nKarnataka, India; https://orcid.org/0009-0000-7004-0401  \nAuthor Contributions \nK.

Methods  \n1.1 Materials and solvents \nZinc powder (Zn, 96%), lead iodide (PbI2, 98%), and lead bromide (PbBr2, 98%) were \npurchased from TCI chemicals. Methylammonium bromide (MABr, 99.99%), formamidinium \niodide (FAI, 99.99%) were purchased from GreatCell Solar. Cesium iodide (CsI, 99.999%) and \nTin(IV) \nchloride \npentahydrate \n(SnCl4.5H2O, \n98%), \n2,2’,7,7’-tetrakis \n[N, \nN-di(4-\nmethoxyphenyl) amino]-9,9’-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD, 99%) were purchased from \nSigma-Aldrich. N, N-Dimethyl formamide (DMF, 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%), \nacetonitrile (ACN), 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP), Ethanol (C2H5OH), hydrochloric acid (HCl, \n37%) and Acetylacetone (acacH, ≥99%) were also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich without \nfurther purification. Chlorobenzene (CB, 98.0%) and lithium bis (trifluoromethanesulfonyl) \nimide (Li-TFSI, 98.0%) were also purchased from TCI chemicals. Fluorine-doped tin oxide \n(FTO, 7 Ω/sq.) and Hellmanex III were also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Fine silver (Ag, \n99.9%), Copper (99.9%) and Zinc (98%) were purchased from commercial sources.  \n \n1.2 SnO2 precursor solution \nThe precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 31.5 mg of SnCl4.5H2O in 1 mL absolute \nethanol. 20.5 μL of acacH was added as chelating at room temperature to the solution to yield \n[acacH] [Sn]\n⁄\n> 2. In the presence of an excess of acacH, the hydrolytic stability of the tin-\nacac-chelate complex increases, preventing the progress of further condensation reaction. The \nnominal hydrolysis ratio of alcoholic solution prepared from SnCl4.5H2O (ℎ= [H2O] [Sn]\n⁄\n=\n5) was adjusted by dropwise addition of 162 μL of DI water to yield  ℎ= [H2O] [Sn]\n⁄\n= 105. \nThe solution was stirred at 70 ˚C for 2 hrs, giving rise to transparent and stable colloidal \nsolution[1,2].  \n1.3 Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 precursor solution \nA solution was prepared by dissolving 507.1 mg of PbI2 and 73.4 mg of PbBr2 in 1 mL of \nanhydrous DMF and DMSO in a 4:1 (v/v) ratio, stirring at 100 °C for 30 minutes. After cooling, \n172 mg of FAI, 22.4 mg of MABr, and 53 μL of a CsI solution (1.5 M in DMSO) were added \nto the inorganic solution to create the perovskite precursor solution. The precursor solution was \nthen stirred at room temperature for 6 hrs[3]. \n1.4 Spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution \nA solution of spiro-OMeTAD precursor was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, \n17.5 μL of Li-TFSI solution (520 mg in 1 mL ACN), and 28.8 μL of t-BP in 1 mL of CB[3].  \n1.5 Ag-Cu-Zn alloy preparation  \n\n\n \n \n13 \n \nTo prepare the back electrode, silver, copper, and zinc metals were utilized in the specified \ncompositions, as detailed in the table below: \n \nTable S1.

Subsequently, the \nFTO glasses were subjected to UV ozone cleaning for 30 minutes before being used. A compact \nlayer of SnO2 was prepared by spin coating of SnO2 precursor solution at 3000 RPM for 30 \nsecs on FTO glass, followed by annealing at 145 ˚C for 1 hr. After cooling down, it was UV \nozone treated for 30 minutes before being used. The perovskite precursor solution was applied \non FTO/SnO2 layer through a two-step spin-coating process. In the first step, the coating was \nperformed at 1000 RPM for 10 secs with a ramping rate of 500 RPM/sec. Subsequently, in the \nsecond step, the spin-coating process was carried out at 6000 RPM for 20 secs with a ramping \nrate of 2000 RPM/sec. During the second step, 200 μL of CB was poured onto the spinning \nsubstrate 5 secs prior to the end of spinning program, followed by the annealing at 110 ˚C for 1 \nhr on the hotplate. 20 μL of spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated upon the perovskite layer \nat 500 RPM for 3 secs, and 3000 RPM for 30 secs. Finally, the devices were completed by \nthermal evaporation of ~100 nm thick fine silver and silver-copper-zinc alloys. The deposition \nrate during this process was set at 1 to 5 Å/sec under high vacuum (6.5×10-6 mbar). The active \narea of the devices, amounting to 0.09 cm2, was defined using an evaporation mask. \n1.7 Solar cell characterization  \nThe current-voltage (J–V) characteristics of the unencapsulated solar cells were measured using \na Keithley 2400 instrument. The measurement involved a forward scan from -0.5 V to 1.5 V at \na scanning rate of 50 mV/s, with a voltage step of 10 mV and a delay time of 50 ms. The \nmeasurements were conducted under ambient conditions and illuminated with AM1.5G light at \nan intensity of 100 mW/cm2 from a solar simulator (Newport). The solar simulator was \ncalibrated using a standard silicon solar cell device.   \n1.8 X-rays diffraction (XRD) \nXRD measurements were conducted using a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer that was \nequipped with a copper Kα anode. The diffractometer operated at a tube output voltage of 45 \nkV and a current of 30 mA. Single scans were performed within the angular range of 10˚ to 80˚ \nusing Bragg's angle, and the measurements were carried out in parallel beam (PB) geometry. \n1.9 Raman spectroscopy \nRaman spectra were obtained using a LabRAM HR evolution Raman microscope. A 532 nm \nargon ion laser was used as an excitation source for spectroscopic measurements.  \n1.10 \nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) \n\n\n \n \n14 \n \nThe surface and cross-sectional morphologies of perovskite films deposited on SnO2/FTO \nsubstrates were characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, \nZEISS Ultra55, Mono Carl Zeiss). The perovskite films were fabricated following the same \nprotocols employed in solar cell production. \n1.11 \nAtomic Force Microscopy (AFM) \nThe surface morphologies and localized work functions of back electrode films were \ncharacterized using AFM with a Park NX20 system in Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) \nmode. A PtIr-PPP-EFM probe was employed as the scanning probe microscopy (SPM) probe. \n1.12 \nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) \nChemistry of electrode degradation was examined by Thermo Scientific XPS/UPS system using \nan Al Kα (λ = 0.83 nm, hυ = 1486.7 eV). X-ray source was operated at 23.5 W, and the data \nwere analyzed using CasaXPS software. \n1.13 \nUltraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) \nThe work functions of thin films were calculated by Thermo-Scientific XPS/UPS system in \nUPS mode. UV photons are produced using a gas discharge lamp, typically filled with helium. \nHe-I line having the energy of 21.22 eV was used for the spectroscopic measurements.  \n1.14 \nUV-Visible-NIR spectroscopy \nThe absorbance, transmittance, and reflectance spectra of thin films were collected by \nPerkinElmer LAMBDA 1050+ UV-Vis-NIR spectrometers. Aluminum coated glass was used \nas a reference for reflectance.  \n2. Device Fabrication \n \nFigure S1.

When one \nsilver atom out of eight is replaced by copper (Cu), the structure transitions to a tetragonal phase \nwith a space group P4/mmm (No. 123). The addition of 0.5 to 1.0 % zinc (Zn) in place of Cu \nmaintains the tetragonal phase. The crystal structures of all compositions are illustrated in \nFigure S1. \n \nFigure S3.

XPS full survey of Ag (control), and ACZ0.5 (target) electrode films. \nThe Raman spectra of Ag, ACZ0.0, ACZ0.5, and ACZ1.0 electrode films are recorded at room \ntemperature and shown in Figure S5. The Ag Raman spectrum consists of vibrational mode at \n239, 883, 1287, 1359, and 1606 𝑐𝑚−1. In the Raman spectra of Ag, the band observed at 239 \ncm-1,  is due to 𝐴𝑔−𝑂 stretching mode[4,5], the vibrational peak observed at 883 cm-1 arises \ndue to 𝐴𝑔−𝑂 interaction through the hydrophilic part of carboxylic group[6,7]. The other band \nobserved at 1287, 1359, and 1606 cm-1 are arise due to carboxylic symmetric and anti-\nsymmetric 𝐶= 𝑂 stretching vibration of carboxylic group, respectively[4,6]. The Raman \nspectrum of ACZ0.0 reveals a new mode at 617 𝑐𝑚−1, associated with the bending of 𝐶−𝑂 \nbonds[8,9], while the 239 𝑐𝑚−1 mode of 𝐴𝑔−𝑂 has vanish. The Raman spectra of ACZ0.5 and \nACZ1.0 exhibit a new mode at 998 𝑐𝑚−1, wherein the 𝐶−𝑂 bending mode at 617 𝑐𝑚−1 has \nceased to be observed. This mode is associated with 2TO (transverse-optical) vibration mode \nof wurtzite ZnO[10,11], which confirms the formation of ZnO on the surface of thin films.  \n \nFigure S5. Raman spectra of Ag, ACZ0.0, ACZ0.5, and ACZ1.0 electrode films, which were \nobtained using a 532 nm excitation wavelength. \nThe UPS spectra of Ag and ACZ0.5 are shown in  Figure S6. The determination of the energy \nassociated with the secondary electron cutoff (SECO) entails an examination of the UPS \nspectrum when plotted in relation to the Fermi level. Assuming that Fermi level alignment is \npreserved between the spectrometer and the sample surface, the work function of the sample \nsurface is given by[12] \nϕ = hν −SECO                                                                                                                    (1) \nEquation (1) is certainly valid for a metal’s surface or for an adsorbate on a conducting substrate. \nThe work functions of Ag and ACZ0.5 are calculated to be 4.61 eV and 4.93 eV, respectively, \nas shown in Figure S6a,b.  \n\n\n \n \n17 \n \n \nFigure S6.

    "abstract": "Though the common metal electrode-based perovskite solar cells have achieved\na power conversion efficiency of >25%, they also play a crucial role in\naccelerating the degradation of the cells. In this study, we investigated phase\ntransition engineering in Ag electrodes via Cu and Zn alloying, transforming\nfrom a cubic to a tetragonal phase. These alloyed electrodes are then thermally\ndeposited as back electrodes in perovskite solar cells. We conducted a\ncomprehensive analysis of the pure Ag and Ag-Cu-Zn alloys deposited atop a\nhole-transport layer for use in Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3-based\nsolar cells. Our findings reveal that solar cells developed with pure Ag\nelectrodes demonstrate a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.71%,\ncharacterized by a fill factor (FF) of 74.8%, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of\n1.08 V, and a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.17 mA/cm2. Conversely,\nsolar cells fabricated with optimized Ag0.875Cu0.120Zn0.005 electrodes exhibit\nenhanced performance metrics, with an FF of 72.5%, VOC of 1.12 V, and JSC of\n23.39 mA/cm2, culminating in an elevated PCE of 19.02%. Moreover, this\nelectrode demonstrates remarkable durability, sustaining operational integrity\nfor 460 hours for the PSCs stored in the N2 glove box, in contrast to the 320\nhours for cells with Ag electrodes. The Ag-Cu-Zn alloys exhibited high\nresistance to corrosion and good adhesion on the hole-transport material layer\ncompared to a layer of Ag. These advancements may lead to the realization of\ncost-effective, durable, and efficient solar energy conversion systems.",
