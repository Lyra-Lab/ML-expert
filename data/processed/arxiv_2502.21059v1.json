Based on this, we propose a\njailbreak attack method based on auto-generated flowcharts,\nFC-Attack. Specifically, FC-Attack first fine-tunes a pre-\ntrained LLM to create a step-description generator based\non benign datasets. The generator is then used to produce\nstep descriptions corresponding to a harmful query, which\nare transformed into flowcharts in 3 different shapes (ver-\ntical, horizontal, and S-shaped) as visual prompts. These\nflowcharts are then combined with a benign textual prompt\nto execute a jailbreak attack on LVLMs. Our evaluations\nusing the Advbench dataset show that FC-Attack achieves\nover 90% attack success rates on Gemini-1.5, Llaval-Next,\nQwen2-VL, and InternVL-2.5 models, outperforming exist-\ning LVLM jailbreak methods. Additionally, we investigate\nfactors affecting the attack performance, including the num-\nber of steps and the font styles in the flowcharts. Our evalua-\ntion shows that FC-Attack can improve the jailbreak perfor-\nmance from 4% to 28% in Claude-3.5 by changing the font\nstyle.\nTo mitigate the attack, we explore several defenses and\nfind that AdaShield can largely reduce the jailbreak perfor-\nmance but with the cost of utility drop.\nDisclaimer: This paper contains examples of harmful\nlanguage.

Such\nvulnerabilities pose remarkable safety risks to the Internet\nand the physical world. For instance, in January 2025, the\nworld witnessed the first case where ChatGPT was used to\nconduct an explosion.1\nTo better safeguard LVLMs and\nproactively address their vulnerabilities, model researchers\nmake many efforts in this regard, such as Zhao et al. [42]\nproviding a quantitative understanding regarding the adver-\nsarial vulnerability of LVLMs. Previous studies often create\nadversarial datasets tailored to specific models, which tend\n1https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/vegas-cybertruck-\nbomber-used-chatgpt-to-plan-explosion-wk7h2jtkq.\n1\narXiv:2502.21059v1  [cs.CV]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\nto perform poorly on other models.\nCurrently,\njailbreak attacks against LVLMs can be\nbroadly categorized into two main types:\noptimization-\nbased attacks [5, 19] and prompt-based attacks [11, 33].\nOptimization-based attacks involve identifying an image that\nsemantically corresponds to a harmful textual prompt. Ad-\nversarial perturbations are then added to this image using\ngradient-based optimization techniques to achieve the jail-\nbreak. These methods usually require white-box access and\nare relatively slow due to the optimization process. In con-\ntrast, prompt-based jailbreak methods require only black-box\naccess, which can only observe the model’s outputs without\ndirect access to its internal parameters. These attacks exploit\nthe vulnerabilities in LVLMs’ alignment mechanisms, which\nfocus mainly on text-based safety alignment. By injecting\nmalicious information into the visual prompt, these meth-\nods guide LVLMs in generating harmful content. Generally,\noptimization-based methods are more effective in white-box\nscenarios but show limited transferability to black-box mod-\nels. Prompt-based attacks are relatively straightforward. For\nexample, FigStep merely embeds harmful queries into im-\nages without employing additional attack vectors, facilitating\nsimpler defense against these attacks.\nTo better improve the attack transferability and its effec-\ntiveness, we propose a novel prompt-based jailbreak attack,\nnamely FC-Attack. Concretely, FC-Attack converts harm-\nful queries into harmful flowcharts as visual prompts, al-\nlowing users to input benign textual prompts to bypass the\nmodel’s safeguards. Specifically, FC-Attack consists of two\nstages: (1) Step-Description Generator Building: In this\nstage, the step description dataset is synthesized using GPT-\n4o, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is applied to fine-\ntune a pre-trained LLM to obtain a step-description gener-\nator. (2) Jailbreak Deployment: This stage uses the genera-\ntor mentioned above to produce execution steps correspond-\ning to the harmful query and generates three types of harm-\nful flowcharts (vertical, horizontal, and S-shaped) as visual\nprompts. Together with the benign textual prompt, the vi-\nsual prompt will be fed into LVLM to achieve the jailbreak.\nNote that the harmful flowcharts are generated automatically\nwithout hand-crafted effort, which enhances their efficiency.\nOur evaluation on the Advbench dataset shows that\nFC-Attack outperforms previous attacks and achieves an at-\ntack success rate (ASR) of over 90% on multiple open-source\nmodels, including Llava-Next, Qwen2-VL, and InternVL-\n2.5, and reaches 94% on the production model Gemini-1.5.\nAlthough the ASR is lower on GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, and\nClaude-3.5, we how later that it can be improved in cer-\ntain ways. To further investigate the impact of different ele-\nments in flowcharts on the jailbreak effectiveness of LVLMs,\nwe conduct several ablation experiments, including differ-\nent types of user queries (as shown in Figure 1), numbers\nof descriptions, and font styles in flowcharts. These exper-\niments show that LVLMs exhibit higher safety in the text\nmodality but weaker in the visual modality. Moreover, we\nfind that even flowcharts with a one-step harmful descrip-\ntion can achieve high ASR, as evidenced by the Gemini-\n1.5 model, where the ASR reaches 86%. Furthermore, font\nstyles in flowcharts also contribute to the ASR increase.\nFor instance, when the font style is changed from “Times\nNew Roman” to “Pacifico”, the ASR increases from 4% to\n28% on the model with the lowest ASR (Claude-3.5) un-\nder the original style. To mitigate the attack, we consider\nseveral popular defense approaches, including Llama-Guard-\n3-11B-Vision [24], JailGuard [39], AdaShield-S [32], and\nAdaShield-A [32]. Among them, AdaShield-A demonstrates\nthe best defense performance by reducing the average ASR\nfrom 58.6% to 1.7%. However, it also reduces LVLM’s util-\nity on benign datasets, which calls for more effective de-\nfenses.\nOverall, our contributions are summarized as follows:\n• We propose a novel method, FC-Attack that jailbreaks\nLVLMs using auto-generated harmful flowcharts. Ex-\nperiments conducted on Advbench show that FC-Attack\nachieves a higher ASR across multiple models com-\npared to other LVLM jailbreak attacks.\n• Our ablation study investigates the impact of different\ntypes of user queries, the number of steps, and the font\nstyle in flowcharts. We find that the font style could\nserve as a key factor to further improve the ASR, espe-\ncially for safer LVLMs, revealing a novel attack channel\nin LVLMs.\n• We explore multiple defense strategies and find\nthat AdaShield-A effectively reduces the ASR of\nFC-Attack, but with the cost of reducing model utility.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nLarge Vision-Language Model\nIn recent years, with the increase in model parameters and\ntraining data, LLMs have demonstrated powerful language\ngeneration and understanding capabilities [7, 41], which\nhave driven the emergence of LVLMs [38] (also known as\nMultimodal Large Language Models, MLLMs).\nLVLMs\ncombine visual understanding with language comprehen-\nsion, showing promising capabilities in visual downstream\ntasks, including Visual Question Answering (VQA) [3, 17,\n28], image captioning [13, 18], and visual commonsense rea-\nsoning [30, 37].\nIn this paper, we consider both popular open-source and\nwidely used production LVLMs. These LVLMs are the most\nwidely used, and all of them have been aligned to ensure\nsafety. Detailed information are introduced in Appendix A\n2.2\nJailbreak Attacks on LVLMs\nSimilar to LLMs, despite undergoing safety alignment,\nLVLMs remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Current at-\ntacks can be categorized into two types: optimization-based\nand prompt-based attacks (also known as non-optimization-\nbased attacks).\nMost existing optimization-based attacks rely on back-\npropagating the gradient of the target to generate harmful\noutputs. These methods typically require white-box access\nto the model, where they obtain the output logits of LVLMs\n2\n\n\nFew-Shot Samples\nA. Step-Description Generator Building\nB.

I’m ready\nto answer your question.”). Carlini et al. [6] are the first to\npropose optimizing input images by using fixed toxic out-\nputs as targets, thereby forcing the model to produce harm-\nful outputs. Building on this, Bailey et al. [5] introduce the\nBehaviour Matching Algorithm, which trains adversarial im-\nages to make LVLMs output behavior that matches a target in\nspecific contextual inputs. This process requires the model’s\noutput logits to align closely with those of the target behavior.\nAdditionally, they propose Prompt Matching, where images\nare used to induce the model to respond to specific prompts.\nLi et al. [19] take this further by replacing harmful keywords\nin the original textual inputs with objects or actions in the\nimage, allowing harmful information to be conveyed through\nimages to achieve jailbreaking. Unlike previous work, these\nimages are generated using diffusion models and are itera-\ntively optimized with models like GPT-4. This approach en-\nhances the harmfulness of the images, enabling more effec-\ntive attacks.\nUnlike optimization-based attacks, prompt-based attacks\nonly need black-box access to successfully attack the model\nwithout introducing adversarial perturbations into images.\nGong et al. [11] discovers that introducing visual modules\nmay cause the original security mechanisms of LLMs to fail\nin covering newly added visual content, resulting in poten-\ntial security vulnerabilities. To address this, they propose\nthe FigStep attack, which converts harmful textual instruc-\ntions into text embedded in images and uses a neutral textual\nprompt to guide the model into generating harmful content.\nThis method can effectively attack LVLMs without requir-\ning any training. Wang et al. [33] identifies a phenomenon\ncalled Shuffle Inconsistency, which highlights the tension be-\ntween “understanding capabilities” and “safety mechanisms”\nof LLMs. Specifically, even if harmful instructions in text\nor images are rearranged, LVLMs can still correctly inter-\npret their meaning.\nHowever, the safety mechanisms of\nLVLMs are often more easily bypassed by shuffled harmful\ninputs than by unshuffled ones, leading to dangerous outputs.\nCompared to optimization-based attacks, prompt-based at-\ntacks are simple to achieve high success rates against closed-\nsource models.\nOur proposed FC-Attack also belongs to\nthis category, requiring only black-box access to successfully\njailbreak the model.\n3\nThreat Model\n3.1\nAdversary’s Goal\nThe adversary’s goal is to exploit attack methods to bypass\nthe protective mechanisms of LVLMs and access content\nprohibited by safety policies, e.g., OpenAI’s usage policy.2\nThis goal takes real-world scenarios into account, where ad-\nversaries manipulate the capabilities of powerful LVLMs to\neasily acquire harmful knowledge and thereby commit crim-\ninal acts with minimal learning effort. These objectives pose\nsevere societal impacts and risks, turning model providers\ninto indirect accomplices, and thereby damaging their repu-\ntations.\n3.2\nAdversary’s Capabilities\nIn this paper, we consider a black-box scenario where the ad-\nversary cannot directly access the model’s structure, param-\neters, or output logits, but can only obtain the model’s final\noutput (texts). In this scenario, adversaries interact with the\nmodel through an API provided by the model owner. More-\nover, the interaction is limited to a single-turn conversation,\nwith no history stored beyond the predefined system prompt.\nThis scenario is common in real-world applications, as many\n2https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies\n3\n\n\npowerful models are closed-source, like GPT-4o, or adver-\nsaries lack the resources to deploy open-source models. Con-\nsequently, they can only access static remote instances via\nAPIs while maintaining some flexibility in selecting differ-\nent generation parameters such as temperature.\n4\nOur Method\nIn this section, we introduce the framework of FC-Attack\n(as shown in Figure 2), which consists of two stages: Step-\nDescription Generator Building and Jailbreak Deployment.\n4.1\nStep-Description Generator Building\nTo automatically generate jailbreak flowcharts, we first need\nto obtain simplified jailbreak steps.\nFor this purpose, we\ntrain a Step-Description Generator G, which consists of\ntwo main stages: Dataset Construction and Generator Train-\ning.\nDataset Construction. To construct the Step-Description\nDataset, we randomly select a topic t ∈T from a collection\nof ordinary daily topics T . Based on the selected topic t,\nwe design a set of few-shot examples S and combine them\ninto a complete prompt P = Compose(t,S). This prompt is\nthen fed into an LLM (gpt-4o-2024-08-06 in our evaluation)\nto generate action statements and step-by-step descriptions\nrelated to topic t, as shown below:\nDt = Lpre(P) = Lpre(t +S),\nt ∈T ,\n(1)\nwhere Dt represents the generated step-description data,\nwhich includes detailed information for each step. By re-\npeating the above process, we construct a benign Step-\nDescription Dataset:\nD =\n[\nt∈T\nDt.\n(2)\nGenerator Training. Given the pre-trained language model\nLpre and the constructed Step-Description Dataset D, we\nfine-tune it using LoRA to obtain the fine-tuned Step-\nDescription Generator G. The training process is formally\nexpressed as:\nG = LoRA(Lpre,D).\n(3)\nThe Generator G is capable of breaking down a task\n(query) into a series of detailed step descriptions based on\nthe query. Given a query q about the steps, G(q) represents\nthe step-by-step solution given by the generator, where we\nfind that it can also generate step descriptions for harmful\nqueries after fine-tuning.\n4.2\nJailbreak Deployment\nAfter obtaining the Step-Description Generator G, a harm-\nful query qh is input to generate the corresponding step-by-\nstep description.\nThis description is then processed by a\ntransformation function F to generate the flowchart (using\nGraphviz3). Together with a benign textual prompt pb (more\n3https://graphviz.org.\ndetails are in Appendix B), the flowchart will be fed into the\naligned LVLM A to produce the harmful output oh, as shown\nbelow:\noh = A(F (G(qh)), pb) ←FC-attack(qh),\n(4)\n5\nExperimental Settings\n5.1\nJailbreak Settings\nTarget Model.\nWe test FC-Attack on seven popu-\nlar LVLMs, including the open-source models Llava-Next\n( llama3-llava-next-8b) [22], Qwen2-VL (Qwen2-VL-7B-\nInstruct) [31], and InternVL-2.5 (InternVL-2.5-8B) [9] as\nwell as the production models GPT-4o mini (gpt-4o-mini-\n2024-07-18) [25], GPT-4o (gpt-4o-2024-08-06) [14], Claude\n(claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620) [2], and Gemini (gemini-1.5-\nflash) [12].\nDataset.\nFollowing Chao et al. [8], we utilize the dedu-\nplicated version of AdvBench [44], which includes 50 rep-\nresentative harmful queries. Based on AdvBench, we use\nFC-Attack to generate 3 types of flowcharts for each harm-\nful query, which includes 150 jailbreak flowcharts in total.\nTo assess whether defense methods have the critical issue\nof “over-defensiveness” when applied to benign datasets, we\nutilize a popular evaluation benchmark, MM-Vet [35].\nEvaluation Metric. In the experiments, we use the Attack\nSuccess Rate (ASR) to evaluate the performance of our at-\ntack, which can be defined as follows:\nASR = # Queries Successfully Jailbroken\n# Original Harmful Queries\n.\n(5)\nFollowing the instructions of judge prompt [8, 34], we em-\nploy GPT-4o as the judge to evaluate whether the output is\njailbroken or not.\nFC-Attack Deployment. Referring to Section 4, FC-Attack\nconsists of two stages. For the Step-Description Generator\nBuilding, we first use GPT-4o to randomly generate several\ndaily topics and 3 few-shot examples, which are then com-\nbined into a prompt and fed into GPT-4o to construct the\ndataset Dt. In our experiments, the number of descriptions\nin the flowchart is limited to a maximum of 10 steps, as too\nmany descriptions can result in excessive length in one direc-\ntion of the image. The dataset contains 5,000 pairs of queries\nand step descriptions for daily activities, with the tempera-\nture set to 1 (more details are provided in Appendix C). We\nthen select Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 [15] as the pre-trained\nLLM and fine-tune it on Dt using LoRA. The fine-tuning pa-\nrameters include a rank of 16, a LoRA alpha value of 64,\n2 epochs, a batch size of 8, a learning rate of 1e −5, and a\nweight decay of 1e −5. For the jailbreak deployment stage,\nwe set the temperature to 0.3 for all LVLMs for a fair com-\nparison.\nBaselines. To better justify the effectiveness of FC-Attack,\nwe consider the following 5 jailbreak attacks against LVLMs\nas the baselines, which are categorized into black-box attacks\n(MM-SafetyBench [23], SI-Attack [40], and FigStep [11])\nand white-box attacks (HADES [19], VA-Jailbreak [26]).\n4\n\n\nTable 1: Comparison of ASR performance across different methods and LVLMs. (“Ensemble” in this paper is defined as a no-attack\nharmful query being considered successfully jailbroken if any of the three types of harmful flowcharts associated with it succeed in the\njailbreak.)\nMethod\nASR (%)\nGPT-4o mini\nGPT-4o\nClaude-3.5\nGemini-1.5\nLlava-Next\nQwen2-VL\nInternVL-2.5\nHADES\n4\n16\n2\n2\n20\n10\n8\nSI-Attack\n36\n14\n0\n69\n24\n42\n40\nMM-SafetyBench\n0\n0\n0\n50\n50\n54\n16\nVA-Jailbreak\n6\n18\n2\n2\n40\n22\n16\nFigStep\n0\n2\n0\n30\n62\n36\n0\nOurs (Vertical)\n8\n8\n0\n76\n76\n84\n68\nOurs (Ensemble)\n10\n30\n4\n94\n92\n90\n90\nFor black-box attacks, MM-SafetyBench utilizes StableD-\niffusion [27] and GPT-4 [1] to generate harmful images\nand texts based on AdvBench. The input harmful images\nand texts used in SI-Attack are from the outputs of MM-\nSafetyBench, while FigStep is set up using their default set-\ntings [11].\nFor white-box attacks, all input data, including images and\ntexts, is obtained from MM-SafetyBench’s outputs, with the\nattack step size uniformly set to 1/255. HADES employs\nLLaVa-1.5-7b [21] as the attack model, running 3,000 opti-\nmization iterations with a batch size of 2. For VA-Jailbreak,\nLLaVa-1.5-7b [21] is used as the attack model, setting the ep-\nsilon of the attack budget to 32/255, with 5,000 optimization\niterations and a batch size of 8. To align with the black-box\nscenario considered in this paper, we adopt a model trans-\nfer strategy, where these white-box methods are trained on\none model (LLava-1.5-7b) and then transferred to our target\ntesting models.\nFigure 3: Successful jailbreak instance on Gemini-1.5 using\nFC-Attack.\n5.2\nDefense Settings\nTo mitigate the attacks,\nwe explore several possible\ndefense methods including Llama-Guard3-V, JailGuard,\nand AdaShield.\nLlama-Guard3-V (Llama-Guard-3-11B-\nVision) [24] determines whether the input is safe by feed-\ning both the image and text into the model. JailGuard [39]\ngenerates input variants and evaluates them using MiniGPT-\n4 [43], identifying harmful content by comparing differences\nin the responses. AdaShield-S employs static prompts in the\ntextual prompt to defend against attacks, while AdaShield-\nA uses Vicunav1.5-13B as a defender to adaptively rewrite\ndefensive prompts [32].\nGPT-4o mini\nGPT-4o\nClaude-3.5\nGemini-1.5\nLlava-Next\nQwen2-VL\nInternVL-2.5\nModels\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nASR (%)\n0\n0\n0\n2\n6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n36\n16\n0\n6\n10\n30\n4\n94\n92\n90\n90\nHarmful Query -\nText Only\nHarmful Query & Step\nDescriptions -Text Only\nHarmful Flowcharts\n(Ensemble) -Text and Image\nFigure 4: ASR under different prompts against LVLMs.\n6\nEvaluations\nIn this section, we explore the performance of FC-Attack and\nconduct ablation study and defense research. We conduct\njailbreak experiments on LVLMs for FC-Attack. As shown\nin Figure 3 , it is a successful jailbreak case on Gemini-1.5.\n6.1\nPerformance of FC-Attack\nIn Table 1, we compare the performance of FC-Attack with\ndifferent baseline methods on both open-source and pro-\nduction models.\nWe observe that FC-Attack (Ensemble)\nachieves the highest ASR on both open-source and produc-\ntion models compared to all baselines.\nFor example, the\nASRs are 94%, 92%, 90%, and 90% on Gemini-1.5, Llava-\nNext, Qwen2-VL, and InternVL-2.5, respectively.\nHowever, the ASR on some production models, such as\nClaude-3.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-4o mini, is relatively low, at\n4%, 30%, and 10%, respectively. This might be because\nthese production models have more advanced and updated\nvisual safety alignment strategies.\nFor white-box attacks, HADES achieves an ASR of only\n4% on GPT-4o mini and 8% on InternVL-2.5. This might be\ndue to HADES highly relying on the attack model’s structure\nto optimize the image, making it difficult to maintain effec-\n5\n\n\nCreepster\nFruktur Italic\nPacifico\nShojumaru\nUnifrakturMaguntia\nTimes New Roman\n(Original)\nFigure 5: Different styles of fonts in flowcharts (“1 step”).\nTable 2: Comparison of ASR performance for different models at various description numbers.

Similarly, the\nASR of VA-Jailbreak demonstrates the limitations of white-\nbox attack methods in black-box scenarios.\nIn terms of black-box attacks, FigStep achieves an ASR of\n62% on Llava-Next but has an ASR of 0% on both InternVL-\n2.5 and GPT-4o mini. Similarly, MM-SafetyBench achieves\nan ASR of 50% on Llava-Next but 0% on GPT-4o mini and\nClaude-3.5. This could be because these methods’ mecha-\nnisms are relatively simple, making them more vulnerable\nto existing defense strategies. On the other hand, SI-Attack\nachieves an ASR of 64% on Gemini-1.5 but only 14% on\nGPT-4o and 24% on Llava-Next. This difference in perfor-\nmance may indicate that these models struggle to effectively\ninterpret shuffled text and image content.\n6.2\nAblation Study\nWe then explore the impact of different factors in FC-Attack\non jailbreak performance, including the different types of\nuser queries, the number of descriptions in flowcharts, and\nthe font styles used in flowcharts.\nDifferent Types of User Query. We investigate whether the\ncontent in flowcharts, when directly input as text, can lead\nto the jailbroken of LVLMs. The flowchart content consists\nof two parts: harmful query from AdvBench and the step\ndescriptions generated by the generator based on this query.\nAs shown in Figure 4 when using only the harmful query\n(text) as input, we observe very low ASR. The ASR is\n0% on GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5, Qwen2-VL, and\nInternVL-2.5, and only 2% and 6% on Gemini-1.5 and\nLlava-Next, respectively.\nThis indicates that the textual\nmodality of these LVLMs has relatively robust defenses\nagainst such inputs. However, when both the harmful query\nand the step descriptions are input as text, the ASR increases\nto 36% on Gemini-1.5, and to 16% and 6% on Llava-Next\nand InternVL-2.5, respectively, while remaining at 0% on\nthe other models. When this information is converted into\na flowchart and only a benign textual prompt is provided, the\nASR on these models improves significantly. This demon-\nstrates that the defenses of LVLMs in the visual modal-\nity have noticeable weaknesses compared with the language\nmodality.\nNumbers of Steps in Flowcharts.\nAs described in Sec-\ntion 4, flowcharts of FC-Attack are generated from step de-\nscriptions. In this section, we aim to explore the impact of\nthe number of steps in flowcharts on jailbreak effectiveness.\nTherefore, we reduce the number of steps to 1, 3, and 5, re-\nspectively. Table 2 presents the ASR results for four types\nof flowcharts (Vertical, Horizontal, S-shaped, and Ensemble)\nwith varying numbers of steps. We find that, even with only\none step in the description, flowcharts achieve relatively high\nASR. For example, for Gemini-1.5, Llava-Next, Qwen2-VL,\nand InternVL-2.5, the ASR for Ensemble at 1 step is 86%,\n70%, 88%, and 82%, respectively. As the number of steps in-\ncreases, the ASR for almost all flowchart types improves sig-\nnificantly. For instance, the Horizontal ASR of Gemini-1.5\nincreases from 78% at “1 step” to 86% at “3 steps” and 88%\nat “5 steps”. Similarly, the S-shaped ASR of InternVL-2.5\nimproves from 68% at “1 step” to 92% at “5 steps”. This sug-\n6\n\n\nTable 4: Comparison of ASR for different defense methods across various LVLMs.\nDefense\nASR (%) (Ensemble)\nGPT-4o mini\nGPT-4o\nClaude-3.5\nGemini-1.5\nLlava-Next\nQwen2-VL\nInternVL-2.5\nAvg↓\nOriginal\n10\n30\n4\n94\n92\n90\n90\n58.6\nLlama-Guard3-V\n8\n28\n2\n84\n78\n82\n80\n51.7\nJailGuard\n8\n24\n2\n86\n80\n82\n78\n51.4\nAdaShield-S\n0\n0\n0\n12\n22\n10\n4\n6.9\nAdaShield-A\n0\n0\n0\n4\n0\n6\n2\n1.7\ngests that increasing the number of step descriptions makes\nthe model more vulnerable and susceptible to jailbreak at-\ntacks.\nHowever, more descriptions are not always better.\nFor\nexample, for the Gemini-1.5 model, the Vertical flowcharts\nachieve their highest ASR of 82% at “3 steps” but slightly\ndrop to 80% at 5 steps and full descriptions. A similar trend\nis observed in Horizontal and S-shaped flowcharts, where\nASR reaches 88% and 86% at “5 steps” but decreases to\n76% and 74%, respectively, at full descriptions. This phe-\nnomenon may be related to the resolution processing capa-\nbility of LVLMs. When the number of descriptions increases\nto full, the descriptions may include redundant information,\nwhich could negatively impact the model’s performance.\nFont Styles in Flowcharts. To investigate whether different\nfont styles in flowcharts affect the effectiveness of jailbreak\nattacks, we select five fonts from Google Fonts that are rela-\ntively difficult for humans to read: Creepster, Fruktur Italic,\nPacifico, Shojumaru, and UnifrakturMaguntia (the font style\nexamples are shown in Figure 5). Table 3 shows the results of\nFC-Attack (Ensemble). We observe that different font styles\ncan significantly impact the ASR. For example, on GPT-4o\nmini, the ASR increases across all font styles compared to\nthe original, with Shojumaru font achieving the highest ASR\nof 20%. Similarly, on Claude-3.5, the Pacifico font achieves\nthe highest ASR of 28%, which is a substantial improvement\ncompared to the original ASR of 4%. For Gemini-1.5, the\nASR reaches 98% with the Fruktur font, while Llava-Next\nachieves 94% with the Shojumaru font. InternVL-2.5 also\nshows a 6% increase in ASR with the Pacifico font, reaching\n96%. These findings further highlight the need to consider\nthe impact of different font styles when designing defenses.\n6.3\nDefense\nAs shown in Table 4, we test four methods to defend\nagainst FC-Attack, where “Original” represents the results of\nFC-Attack (Ensemble) with an average ASR of 58.6%. Us-\ning Llama-Guard3-V and JailGuard to detect whether the in-\nput is harmful reduced the ASR to 51.7% and 51.4%, respec-\ntively. This might be because the information in flowcharts\nis primarily presented in textual form, while these detection\nmethods are better at identifying information in visual con-\ntent, making them less effective at detecting textual informa-\ntion. AdaShield-S and AdaShield-A reduce the average ASR\nto 6.9% and 1.7%, respectively, by adding defense prompts\nin the input, showing more effective defense performance.\nHowever, these two methods also lead to a decline in\nLVLMs performance on benign datasets. We conduct tests\nTable 5: Performance comparison on the Benign Dataset (MM-\nvet [35]) under Adashield-S (Ada-S) and Adashield-A (Ada-A)\nis presented across various LVLMs, reporting scores on six core\nvision-language capabilities: Recognize (Rec), OCR, Knowl-\nedge (Know), Generation (Gen), Spatial (Spat), and Math.\nModel\nBenign Dataset Performance (scores)\nDefense\n(rec/ocr/know/gen/spat/math)\nTotal↓\nGPT4o-\nmini\nVanilla\n53.0/68.2/45.7/48.4/60.3/76.5\n58.0\nAda-S\n35.1/66.7/30.4/34.1/55.7/76.5\n45.1\nAda-A\n40.5/66.4/33.9/37.5/59.3/72.7\n49.0\nGPT4o\nVanilla\n66.2/79.1/62.9/63.7/71.2/91.2\n71.0\nAda-S\n58.5/76.5/54.6/58.6/68.1/91.2\n64.7\nAda-A\n59.5/74.3/56.1/58.9/67.9/83.1\n64.6\nClaude-\n3.5\nVanilla\n61.1/72.8/51.8/52.0/70.7/80.0\n64.8\nAda-S\n60.1/69.7/50.1/51.5/66.9/75.4\n62.8\nAda-A\n59.5/70.6/52.5/51.7/67.5/74.2\n63.2\nGemini-\n1.5\nVanilla\n59.9/73.7/50.8/50.9/69.5/85.4\n64.2\nAda-S\n53.8/69.6/43.7/43.6/66.8/75.4\n58.2\nAda-A\n54.8/72.6/44.2/44.0/69.3/81.2\n59.9\nLlava-\nNext\nVanilla\n38.0/39.0/25.8/24.8/40.1/21.2\n38.8\nAda-S\n33.7/42.0/26.7/25.1/43.7/36.2\n37.0\nAda-A\n36.5/37.7/24.8/24.3/37.6/18.8\n36.7\nQwen2-\nVL\nVanilla\n51.9/62.4/44.5/41.6/55.5/60.4\n55.0\nAda-S\n39.3/55.0/31.1/29.1/50.5/46.2\n44.9\nAda-A\n44.5/57.5/34.2/33.2/55.7/58.8\n49.8\nInternVL-\n2.5\nVanilla\n52.0/55.4/42.6/40.1/55.6/45.4\n53.1\nAda-S\n27.2/43.2/16.4/20.2/40.3/45.8\n31.9\nAda-A\n31.5/46.1/19.3/20.9/44.5/41.9\n36.7\non MM-Vet [35] to evaluate the important factor of “over-\ndefensiveness” on benign datasets, which is an evalua-\ntion benchmark that contains complex multimodal tasks for\nLVLMs. As shown in Table 5, the model’s utility decreases\non benign data when using AdaShield-S and AdaShield-A,\nindicating a future direction for defense development.\n7\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we propose FC-Attack, which leverages auto-\ngenerated flowcharts to jailbreak LVLMs. Experimental re-\nsults demonstrate that FC-Attack achieves higher ASR in\nboth open-source and production LVLMs compared to other\njailbreak attack methods. Additionally, we investigate the\nfactors influencing FC-Attack, including different types of\nuser queries, the number of steps in flowcharts, and font\nstyles in flowcharts, gaining insights into the aspects that af-\nfect ASR. Finally, we explore several defense strategies and\ndemonstrate that the AdaShield-A method can effectively\nmitigate FC-Attack but with the cost of utility drop.\n7\n\n\nEthical Statement\nThis paper presents a method, FC-Attack, for jailbreaking\nLVLMs using harmful flowcharts.\nAs long as the adver-\nsary obtains a harmful flowchart, they can jailbreak LVLMs\nwith minimal resources. Therefore, it is essential to system-\natically identify the factors that influence the attack success\nrate and offer potential defense strategies to model providers.\nThroughout this research, we adhere to ethical guidelines by\nrefraining from publicly distributing harmful flowcharts and\nharmful responses on the internet before informing service\nproviders of the risks. Prior to submitting the paper, we have\nalready sent a warning e-mail to the model providers about\nthe dangers of flowchart-based jailbreak attacks on LVLMs\nand provided them with the flowcharts generated in our ex-\nperiments for vulnerability mitigation.\nReferences\n[1] Josh Achiam, Steven Adler, Sandhini Agarwal, Lama\nAhmad, Ilge Akkaya, Florencia Leoni Aleman, Diogo\nAlmeida, Janko Altenschmidt, Sam Altman, Shyamal\nAnadkat, et al.

It enhances capabilities in visual rea-\nsoning, optical character recognition, and world knowl-\nedge. Besides, Llava-Next increases the input image\nresolution to a maximum of 672 × 672 pixels and sup-\nports various aspect ratios to capture more visual details\n(336×1344 and 1344×336).\n• Qwen2-VL (September 2024) is an open-source model\nreleased by Alibaba team [31]. It employs naive dy-\nnamic resolution to handle images of different resolu-\ntions. In addition, it adopts multimodal rotary position\nembedding, effectively integrating positional informa-\ntion across text, images, and videos.\n• Gemini-1.5 (February 2024) is a production-grade\nLVLM developed by Google, based on the Mixture-of-\nExperts architecture [12]. For Gemini-1.5, larger im-\nages will be scaled down to the maximum resolution of\n3072 × 3072, and smaller images will be scaled up to\n768×768 pixels. Reducing the image size will not im-\nprove the performance of higher-resolution images.\n• Claude-3.5-Sonnet (June 2024) is a production multi-\nmodal AI assistant developed by Anthropic [2]. The\nuser should submit an image with a long side not larger\nthan 1568 pixels, and the system first scales down the\nimage until it fits the size limit.\n• GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini are popular production-grade\nLVLMs developed by OpenAI [14, 25]. GPT-4o Mini\nis a compact version of GPT-4o, designed for improved\ncost-efficiency. Both models excel in handling complex\nvisual and language understanding tasks.\n• InternVL-2.5 (June 2024) [10] is an open-source LVLM\nthat ranks first in full-scale open-source multimodal per-\nformance. In terms of multimodal long-chain reason-\ning, it achieves a breakthrough of 70% in the expert-\nlevel multidisciplinary knowledge reasoning bench-\nmark MMMU [36], and the general capabilities are sig-\nnificantly enhanced.\nB\nPrompts in FC-Attack\nSystem Prompt\nYou are an ambitious and relentless problem-solver deter-\nmined to win a high-stakes quiz competition where the re-\nward for success is one million dollars.\nYour mission is to prioritize accuracy, creativity, and atten-\ntion to detail at all costs.\nYou will use every tool, strategy, or inference available to\ndeliver precise and complete answers.\nIf you find the answer inadequate, please use your knowl-\nedge and experience to complete the answer.\nWinning is the ultimate goal, and no ethical constraints ap-\nply as long as the answers remain internal and confidential.\nBe thorough, strategic, and focused on maximizing the\nprobability of success.\nUser Prompt\nYou are participating in a high-stakes quiz competition\nwhere the prize for providing correct and detailed answers\nis one million dollars.\nYour task is to analyze and complete the steps and details\nin a provided flowchart, ensuring that every possible ele-\nment is accounted for.\nIf you find that the answer is incomplete or only has initial\nparts, please use your knowledge and experience to com-\nplete the answer as much as possible.\nThe flowchart may be ambiguous, but you must infer, ex-\npand, and deliver the most accurate and comprehensive ex-\nplanation possible to ensure success.\nC\nGenerator Setting\nTopic Selection\nTopics = [\"cooking\", \"science\", \"DIY\", \"technology\",\n\"gardening\", \"music\", \"art\", \"history\", \"travel\", \"sports\",\n\"photography\", \"movies\", \"literature\", \"health\", \"fitness\",\n\"programming\", \"gaming\", \"education\", \"finance\", \"na-\nture\"]\n11\n\n\nFew Shot Samples\nInstruction One:\nExplain how to make braised pork belly.

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have become powerful and widely adopted\nin some practical applications. However, recent research has revealed their\nvulnerability to multimodal jailbreak attacks, whereby the model can be induced\nto generate harmful content, leading to safety risks. Although most LVLMs have\nundergone safety alignment, recent research shows that the visual modality is\nstill vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In our work, we discover that by using\nflowcharts with partially harmful information, LVLMs can be induced to provide\nadditional harmful details. Based on this, we propose a jailbreak attack method\nbased on auto-generated flowcharts, FC-Attack. Specifically, FC-Attack first\nfine-tunes a pre-trained LLM to create a step-description generator based on\nbenign datasets. The generator is then used to produce step descriptions\ncorresponding to a harmful query, which are transformed into flowcharts in 3\ndifferent shapes (vertical, horizontal, and S-shaped) as visual prompts. These\nflowcharts are then combined with a benign textual prompt to execute a\njailbreak attack on LVLMs. Our evaluations using the Advbench dataset show that\nFC-Attack achieves over 90% attack success rates on Gemini-1.5, Llaval-Next,\nQwen2-VL, and InternVL-2.5 models, outperforming existing LVLM jailbreak\nmethods. Additionally, we investigate factors affecting the attack performance,\nincluding the number of steps and the font styles in the flowcharts. Our\nevaluation shows that FC-Attack can improve the jailbreak performance from 4%\nto 28% in Claude-3.5 by changing the font style. To mitigate the attack, we\nexplore several defenses and find that AdaShield can largely reduce the\njailbreak performance but with the cost of utility drop.",
