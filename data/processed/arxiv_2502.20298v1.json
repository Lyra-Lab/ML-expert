In its traditional implementation with \ncuvettes, it requires sample volumes in the milliliter range. Here, we show how Nanofluidic Scattering \nSpectroscopy, NSS, which measures visible light scattered from a single nanochannel in a spectrally \nresolved way, can reduce this sample volume to the attoliter range for solute concentrations in the mM \nregime, which corresponds to as few as 105 probed molecules. The connection of the nanochannel to a \nmicrofluidic in-and outlet system enables such measurements in continuous flow conditions, and the \nintegrated online optical reference system ensures their long-term stability. On the examples of the non-\nabsorbing solutes NaCl and H2O2, and the dyes Brilliant Blue, Allura Red and Fluorescein, we \ndemonstrate that spectral fingerprints can be obtained with good accuracy and that solute concentrations \ninside the nanochannel can be determined based on NSS-spectra. Furthermore, by applying a reverse \nKramers-Kronig transformation to NSS-spectra, we show that the molar extinction coefficient of the \ndye solutes can be extracted with excellent agreement with the literature values. These results thus \nadvertise NSS as a versatile tool for the spectroscopic analysis of solutes in situations where nanoscopic \nsample volumes, as well as continuous flow measurements, are critical, e.g., in single particle catalysis \nor nanoscale flow cytometry. \n \nKeywords: nanofluidics, nanofluidic scattering spectroscopy, attoliter volumes, Kramers-Kronig \nrelation, concentration measurement, reference scheme  \n \n\n\n \n3 \nIntroduction \n \nSpectroscopy based on electromagnetic radiation is one of the most fundamental experimental \nprinciples in modern science and has enabled an uncountable number of advances in research since its \nformal description1 by Isaac Newton in 1704. For example, it has offered invaluable insights into the \nnature of light and matter due to a plethora of interactions between different mechanical or \nelectromagnetic frequencies, and the very basic structures of, e.g., solid crystals, molecules, atoms, and \nelectrons. Investigating the frequencies of these interactions individually, i.e., in a spectrally resolved \nmanner, yields information about structure, composition, electronic transitions and chemical reactions \nthat occur inside or on the surfaces of the sample the radiation interacted with or originated from. \nBecause of this wide applicability and the wide range of information that can be obtained, spectroscopy \nbased on electromagnetic radiation has become a workhorse in the experimental method toolbox of the \nnatural sciences and has since its introduction diversified into a plethora of associated methods and \ntechniques. \nTo structure these spectroscopic methods, we can organize them according to the size/volume of the \ninvestigated sample. To this end, the standard versions of spectroscopic tools typically enable \ninvestigations of macroscopic samples only, that is, samples that are contained in relatively large \ncontainers, such as cuvettes or gas chambers, or samples like crystals and powders whose volumes are \nlarge compared to the actual molecules or particles of interest. These techniques can then be ordered by \nincreasing frequency (or decreasing wavelength) of the electromagnetic radiation exploited to probe the \nsample, that is, for instance, microwaves2, infrared radiation3–6 (IR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) light, \nX-rays7,8 and electrons9,10.  \nWhile all very powerful in their specific regime, methods employing UV-Vis light have earned a special \nplace in this list since, e.g., many natural processes require the interaction of sunlight with (living) \nmatter, which means that many biologically important molecules absorb UV-Vis light11–14. \nFurthermore, it is also the same wavelength range that is used for modern optical communication15,16 \nand as source for sustainable energy17–21. The main methods used in this spectral domain are \nabsorption22 and emission spectroscopy21,23–25, surface plasmon resonance (SPR)26 and localized surface \n\n\n \n4 \nplasmon resonance (LSPR)27 spectroscopy, as well as Raman spectroscopy28. They, e.g., can reveal the \nelectronic structure of molecules and transitions between different electronic states or electronic \nexcitations and transitions in solids, such as metals and semiconductors, as well as small refractive \nindex (RI) changes induced, e.g. by the specific binding of molecules onto plasmonic surfaces. \nConsidering the typical dimensions of the entities that interact with the radiation at hand, efforts to \nreduce the required sample size or volume to the micro- or even nanoscale have been a strong driving \nforce in the development of new spectrometric methods. As key reasons, we identify that reducing the \nrequired amount of sample material is desirable both from a cost perspective when expensive/scarce \nraw materials are used, and since the synthesis of large volumes of new materials or molecules often is \nvery difficult and time consuming, and hence hampers the throughput in, e.g., screening processes. \nFurthermore, spectroscopic methods that provide micro- or nanoscopic spatial resolution (enabled by \ntiny sample volumes being enough to generate a measurable signal) make it possible to investigate \nnanomaterials, particles, surfaces and molecules in greater detail, in a manner that can differentiate \nbetween locations and species, and ideally also beyond ensemble averaging. These prospects have \ndriven the development of nanoscale spectroscopy methods29, such as IR atomic force (AFM) \nspectroscopy30,31, IR scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) spectroscopy32,33, tip-enhanced Raman-\nspectroscopy34, scanning near-field optical microscopy35 (SNOM), electron energy loss spectroscopy \n(EELS), cathodoluminescence methods35, coherent phonon spectroscopy36, single particle plasmonic \nspectral sensing37,  as well as many approaches involving fluorescence38,39. It is evident from this list \nthat many of these techniques either employ tip- or plasmonic nanoparticle/surface-based signal \nenhancement concepts often in conjunction with scanning microscopy and/or utilize the IR or ultrashort \nwavelength regime (X-ray, electrons) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Especially noteworthy for our \ndiscussion here are concepts that integrate surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with \nnanofluidics, as done with colloidal nanoparticles40 or nanoslits41, enabling the detection of protein \nfolding states and single nucleobases, respectively. Furthermore, the use of nanoscale hotspots in \nconjunction with surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRAS) made it possible to quantify \nmolecules in a nanofluidic system42. While these results clearly demonstrate the possibilities of \n\n\n \n5 \nfluorescence and surface-enhanced Raman and IR approaches, we identify a distinct lack of nanoscale \nspectroscopy methods that are label-free, i.e., do not require fluorescence, and that do not require signal \nenhancement by plasmonic tips, surfaces or nanoparticles. An interesting approach that relies only on \nthe intrinsic properties of molecules to decrease the detection limit while omitting surface enhancements \nis given by photothermal optical diffraction (POD)43 and photothermal optical phase shift (POPS)44, \nboth relying on the temporary variance in refractive index caused by the thermal de-excitation of \nmolecules. However, these techniques do not provide spectral analysis in the Vis spectral range, making \nit clear that a label and plasmonic enhancement-free nanofluidic characterization method for this \nwavelength range is missing. This means that there is to our knowledge currently no method for \nnanofluidic applications that reproduces the performance of established macroscopic UV-Vis \nspectroscopy. \nTo fill this gap, we present Nanofluidic Scattering Spectroscopy (NSS) that enables label-free \nspectroscopy in the visible light (Vis) regime inside individual nanofluidic channels. These channels \noffer tiny sample volumes, in our study here ranging from 2 femtoliter (fl) to 60 attoliter (al), depending \non chosen nanochannel dimensions and settings of the CCD camera. This concept is a further \ndevelopment of Nanofluidic Scattering Microscopy (NSM) we recently have introduced45,46. As the key \nfeatures beyond the state of the art, NSS is not only able to deliver the full wavelength-dependent \nscattering and absorption spectrum, and thus the wavelength-dependent molar extinction coefficient of \na solution contained inside a single nanofluidic channel, but also to reveal its wavelength-dependent RI \nand the absolute concentration of solute, as we illustrate on five examples of transparent, colored and \nfluorescent molecular solutions in the millimolar to molar concentration regime. Furthermore, in \ncontrast to similar techniques on open surfaces47, since a nanofluidic channel connected to a \nmicrofluidic system is used as sample vessel, continuous convective flow is enabled and thus facilitates \nboth high experimental throughput and the possibility to monitor changes in the probed solution \ncontinuously.  \n \n \n\n\n \n6 \nResults and discussion \n \nScattering of electromagnetic radiation from small objects or molecules is a phenomenon often \nencountered in nature. It is the reason why the sky is blue but also why tiny scratches in a window are \nvisible. Mechanistically, those scratches scatter light because they are objects with a different RI than \nthe surrounding glass (n = 1.45948) since they are filled with air (n = 1), and because they are smaller \n(Rayleigh scattering) or comparable (Mie-scattering) to the wavelength of the irradiated light. In \nanalogy to scratches in glass, in this work, we make use of the light scattered from nanofluidic channels \netched into a silicon dioxide (SiO2) surface and hermetically sealed with a glass lid (Figure 1a). The \nchoice of SiO2 as substrate is well established within nanofluidics45,46,49, as it offers great chemical \nresistance, and various fluidic designs can be realized using fabrication methods established for silicon-\nbased microelectronics50. Specifically, the nanochannels we use here constitute an elongated rectangular \ncavity with 200 nm width and depth, and 62 micrometers length, nanofabricated into the 250 nm thick \nthermal oxide layer of a silicon wafer (Figure 1b). The inset in Figure 1b depicts a SEM-image of the \nnanochannel cross section and reveals the nearly rectangular shape with small features that are the \nconsequence of the used etching process. These features do not impact the scattering properties of the \nchannel, as we have corroborated in our earlier work by comparing an analytical model of cylindrical \nnanochannels with exact electrodynamic simulations of nanochannels with square cross sections51. We \nalso note that principally, the exact cross-sectional dimensions, as well as the nanochannel length, can \nbe tailored within a wide range and according to the needs of a specific measurement since they are \ncrafted using highly flexible micro- and nanolithography techniques described in detail in the Methods \nsection. By connecting such nanofluidic channels to a microfluidic in- and outlet system described in \nmore detail below, it becomes possible to flush liquid solutions52,53 but also gases54 through the channel \nand thereby change the RI difference between the solution in the channel and the surrounding medium, \ni.e., SiO2 in our current design. This change, in turn, alters the spectral distribution and intensity of \nvisible light scattered from the nanochannel. Detecting these spectral changes constitutes the operation \nprinciple of NSS.    \n \n\n\n \n7 \nTheoretical foundation of NSS \nTo describe the NSS principle on a more analytical basis, we approximate the rectangular nanochannel \nfrom the experiment as a cylinder of infinite length (Figure 1c). The validity of this approximation has \nbeen corroborated previously using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations55. Furthermore, \nwe adopt the description of the propagation of unpolarized incident electromagnetic waves and how \nthey interact with a nanochannel from Bohren and Huffmann56 to arrive at an expression that describes \nthe scattering cross section of a nanochannel, 𝜎!\"#$$%&, as a function of the geometrical channel cross \nsection, 𝐴∅, its (illuminated) length, 𝐿, and the wavenumber of the incident light, 𝑘= 2𝜋/𝜆, as46  \n \n𝜎!\"#$$%& =\n(∅\n\")#*\n+\n(𝑚, −1), /\n-\n, +\n-\n(/\"0-)\"1. \nEquation 1 \nThis expression also contains the parameter 𝑚= 𝑛& 𝑛234,\n⁄\n, which is the ratio of the RIs of the liquid in \nthe channel, nl, and of the surrounding medium of the channel, which is SiO2 in the present case, nSiO2. \nIt thus becomes evident that a change in nl indeed induces a change in the nanochannels´ scattering \ncross-section, provided all other variables remain constant.  \nAs the first step to establish the fundamental understanding of the NSS methodology, it is relevant to \nanalyze the wavelength-dependence of the RI of SiO248 (channel matrix) and water57 (solvent used), as \nwell as of their ratio, 𝑚 (Figure 1d). Evidently, both RIs only weakly depend on the wavelength and in \na very similar way, such that 𝑚 remains fairly constant across the visible wavelength range. \nFurthermore, calculating the scattering cross sections across the visible spectral range for a water-filled \nnanochannel for parallel (𝜎5), orthogonal (𝜎6) and unpolarized (average, 𝜎!\"#$$%&) incident light reveals \nthat its scattering cross section increases significantly for shorter wavelengths and most strongly for \nparallel polarization (see Figure 1d). \nTo illustrate how the optical contrast is generated in NSS, it is interesting to plot how the scattering \ncross section of the channel depends on 𝑛& over a large 𝑛&-range for a given wavelength (here 600 nm, \nsince it is the center wavelength of the spectrometer we use in our experiments, see Figure 5a), and \nagain for parallel, orthogonal and average polarization of the incident light (Figure 1e). A complete \nanalysis for all wavelengths is given in the Supplementary Information (Figure S2). This reveals that \n\n\n \n8 \nscattering vanishes when 𝑛& = 𝑛234, and that it increases in an almost quadratic fashion when 𝑛& ≤\n 𝑛234,, such that, e.g., an air filled channel (𝑛= 1) scatters much more light than a water filled channel \n(𝑛= 1.333).  We also see that even very small RI changes induce a sizable change in the scattering \ncross section, as we have exploited in our previous work to quantify concentration changes induced by \na catalytic reaction on single nanoparticles46.  \nFor the reverse scenario, 𝑛& ≥ 𝑛234,, it is evident that the scattering cross section increases even more \nquickly per change of RI (Figure 1e). However, liquids with an RI larger than 𝑛234,  are scarce and not \ncommonly used as solvents. Nonetheless, this fact is interesting for future development since a \nnanofluidic system embedded into a matrix with a lower RI than the liquid inside it would boost the \nscattering intensity of the system and thus its ability to discern small RI contrasts.  \n \n \nFigure 1. Principle of Nanofluidic Scattering Spectroscopy. a) Artistic rendering of a nanochannel \nfilled with dye molecules. An incident light beam is partially absorbed by the dye molecules, partially \nscattered on the channel, thereby changes its spectral composition (see Figure S1 for a complete sketch \nof the experimental setup). b) SEM image of a 200 nm x 200 nm nanochannel. The inset shows a cross \n\n\n \n9 \nsection of a nanochannel, being nearly rectangular. The small features are a consequence of the etching \nprocess. c) Sketch of the analytical theoretical model used, with the nanochannel approximated as \ncylinder (grey) and the planes of the incident (orange) and scattered light (green).

The inset shows a zoom in of the RI region relevant for aqueous solutions.  \nHaving established the theoretical foundation, it is now interesting to consider some first practical \naspects. Specifically, we note that what is recorded in an NSS experiment is the spectrally resolved \nintensity of light scattered from a nanofluidic channel, that is, a scattering spectrum. In contrast, \nhowever, in traditional UV-Vis spectroscopy – which we here call absorption spectrophotometry (ASP) \n- an absorption (or absorbance) spectrum is measured and enables the quantification of, e.g., molar \nextinction coefficients, which constitute a fundamental material constant. It is therefore of interest to \nintroduce a general formalism, here first detached from nanochannels, that enables the mathematical \ntransformation of an absorption spectrum into a scattering spectrum. \n \nFigure 2. Analytical transformation from absorption to scattering spectrum for Brilliant Blue. We \nstart with the spectrum of the absorption coefficient, α, for Brilliant Blue (black solid line) as obtained \nby ASP. In the first step, this spectrum is converted to the spectrum of the extinction coefficient, κ, (black \ndashed line). Subsequently, the corresponding change in RI spectrum, Δ𝑛 (green dashed line) is \ncalculated using the Kramers-Kronig relation. Finally, the change in RI spectrum is converted to a \nscattering cross section spectrum difference, Δ𝜎, of the nanochannel (green solid line). The \ncorresponding transformations for Allura Red and Fluorescein are depicted in Figure S3. \n\n\n \n10 \nTo do this, we first remind ourselves that the RI of a solid or liquid is a complex function of wavelength \nas \n \n𝒏(𝝀) = 𝑛(𝜆) + 𝑖𝜅(𝜆). \nEquation 2 \nSecondly, we consider the absorption coefficient spectrum, 𝛼(𝜆), using the Brilliant Blue dye (Figure \n2, black solid line) measured by standard UV-Vis spectroscopy as example. It can be converted into an \nextinction coefficient spectrum, 𝜅(𝜆), (Figure 2, black dashed line) using the expression \n \n𝜅(𝜆) = 𝛼(𝜆) 𝜆\n4𝜋\n. \nEquation 3 \nSubsequently, since the extinction coefficient corresponds to the imaginary part of the RI of the Dye \n(Equation 2), we can calculate the spectral variation in the real part of the RI induced by absorption, \nΔ𝑛(𝜆), (Figure 2, green dashed line) using the Kramers-Kronig relation58,59,60 as \n \n𝛥𝑛(𝜆) = 𝑛(𝜆) −1 =\n,\n7 𝒫∫\n8(9´)\n9´;-<=$´\n$>\n\"\n?\n𝑑𝜆´\n<@\nA\n. \nEquation 4 \nFinally, substituting the obtained expression for the wavelength-dependent RI, 𝑛(𝜆), of the dye into \nEquation 1, we can connect the above analysis to the nanochannel framework. Accordingly, we can \nnow calculate the expected change of the scattering cross section of a nanochannel, Δ𝜎, (Figure 2, green \nsolid line) induced by a change of the liquid, and thus the RI inside the channel, which may be induced \nby a change in the concentration of a solute or the complete exchange of said liquid.  \nNanofluidic design \nFor the NSS experiments, we designed a fluidic chip schematically depicted in Figure 3a and further \nillustrated by corresponding dark-field scattering microcopy images taken at different magnifications \n(Figure 3b-d). As a key step beyond the state of the art45,46, we have implemented two independent \nfluidic systems on the chip. The first one serves as the sample system (Figure 3a - blue) through which \ndifferent sample solutions are introduced. The second one constitutes a reference system (Figure 3a - \norange) filled with water at all times that we will use to compensate for, e.g., fluctuations in irradiated \nlight intensity during a measurement. The sample solution exchange is enabled through a system of \nmicrochannels (50 µm wide and 1.2 µm deep), which at the inlet are connected to a macroscopic \n\n\n \n11 \nreservoir via an O-ring seal (Figure 3e-f), and which on the other end are connected to an array of \nparallel nanochannels with cross-sectional dimensions of 200 nm x 200 nm via a smaller microchannel \n(2 µm wide and 1.2 µm deep).  \n \nFigure 3. Nanofluidics layout. a) Schematic layout of the two micro- and nanofluidic systems \nimplemented on the chip. The reference nanochannel system used for online optical referencing \n(orange) has nanochannels that are arranged colinearly with the sample nanochannels in the center \n(blue). Importantly, however, the two systems are not physically connected to ensure that the reference \nchannel system always is filled with the desired reference liquid, i.e., the solvent – water in the present \ncase, while the liquid is exchanged in the sample fluidic system during a measurement. Liquid access \nand exchange in the nanochannels are enabled via access microchannels (light blue for the sample \nsystem and orange for the reference system) by applying higher pressure to the inlet channel side. b) \nDark-field scattering microscopy image of the sample and reference nanochannels. The distance \nbetween the nanochannels is 20 µm and the sample channels are 62 µm long with a geometric cross \nsection of 200 nm x 200 nm (cf. Figure 1b). The bright points in the center of the sample channels are \nconstrictions that enable the trapping of colloidal nanocrystals, as we have demonstrated in earlier \nwork45,46. Their function is not used in this work. c) Dark-field scattering image of the interface between \nmicro- and nanofluidic systems. d) Dark-field scattering image of the center of the fluidic chip at a \nlower magnification. Note the blue hue of the sample fluidics system as it has been filled with Brilliant \nBlue solution. e) Photograph of the fluidic chip installed in the chip holder. The microfluidic systems \nare visible and connected to liquid reservoirs in the outer perimeter of the chip holder. f) Schematic \ncross section of the inlet reservoirs showing how the chip holder connects to the chip.  \nThe same arrangement is mirrored on the outlet side of the chip. The reference nanochannels, which \nhave the same cross-sectional dimensions as the sample channels to be optically identical, are arranged \nin between and parallel to each of the sample channels, such that one sample and one reference channel \nfit within the opening of the slit of the spectrometer during an experiment (Figure 4g).  \n\n\n \n12 \n \nFigure 4. On-chip online optical referencing. a) To enable the simultaneous online acquisition of \nsample and reference scattering spectra, we align a set of sample and reference nanochannel with the \nslit of the spectrometer. The nanochannels are sized such that spectra from to two separate reference \nchannels and from two separate areas of the sample channels can be recorded simultaneously (areas \nmarked with yellow). The bright area in the center of the sample channel is again a constriction for \ncolloidal particle trapping not used in this study. The microchannels are not visible due to the \nilluminating light being incident parallel to the microchannel walls.  b) Graphic depiction of the optical \nreferencing scheme that delivers the relative scattering intensity difference (RSID) spectra: i) both \nsample and reference nanochannels are filled with solvent water and the spectrum obtained from the \nsample channel is divided by the spectrum from the reference channel to deliver the intrinsic scattering \nintensity difference spectrum between sample and reference channel. ii) the sample channel is filled \nwith the solution of choice and the corresponding scattering spectrum from the sample channel is \ndivided by the (constant) reference spectrum from the still water filled reference channel. iii) The \nintrinsic scattering intensity difference spectrum obtained in step i) is subtracted from the normalized \nsample spectrum to obtain the RSID spectrum. c) RISD spectra obtained by this procedure for 100 mM \nand 60 mM Allura Red solutions. \n \n \n\n\n \n13 \nChip-integrated continuous optical referencing \nThe concept of continuous online optical referencing is a very efficient way to reduce noise and drift \ninduced by fluctuating light intensities, change of focus of the microscope or thermal (expansion) \ninduced effects, and it is widely applied in dual-beam spectrophotometers. To implement such online \nreferencing in an NSS experiment, we rely on the set of reference channels introduced above and the \nsignal treatment sequence depicted in Figure 4a-b that comprises the following steps.  \n(i) Both the reference and sample channel systems are filled with water (or any other solvent used for a \nspecific experiment) by applying a pressure of 2 bar to the corresponding reservoirs in the chip holder. \nA nanochannel pair is placed in the slit of the spectrometer and four scattering spectra are recorded, two \nfrom the reference channel at an upstream and downstream position, and two from the sample channel \nat the same up- and downstream position. It is here of critical importance that the illumination and \nobserved channel length are as identical as possible for all positions, because the signal ratio of sample \nand reference spectra during this step needs to be close to 1 for the evaluation scheme to be valid (see \nalso Figure S4).  One of the two sample-reference spectra pairs is used as a backup and control, as it \nmay happen that sample solution is leaking into the reference channels or that the channels are \ncompromised in another way. To record these spectra, we bin the signal from 50 pixels along the \nrespective nanochannel and position, which corresponds to a ca. 30 µm long fraction of the respective \nnanochannel, to reduce noise. Subsequently, we divide the obtained water-filled sample channel \nspectrum by the water-filled reference channel spectrum to obtain a what we call “intrinsic difference \nspectrum” between sample and reference channel. We will use this intrinsic difference spectrum \n(examples shown in Figure S4a) in the last analysis step (iii) to account for the intrinsic differences in \nscattering profile that (may) exist between a reference and sample channel when they are filled with the \nsame liquid, e.g., due to slightly different dimensions or surface roughness. \n(ii) The water in the sample channel system is exchanged by an aqueous solution of the compound of \ninterest (here the dye Allura Red, as a first example), by exchanging the liquid in the corresponding \nreservoir and again applying 2 bar of pressure to establish a flow through the nanochannel. The \n\n\n \n14 \nmeasured scattering spectrum from the sample channel is then divided by the simultaneously obtained \nspectrum of the water filled reference channel.  \n(iii) As a final step, the intrinsic difference spectrum measured in step (i) is subtracted from the \nreferenced sample spectrum obtained in step (ii), resulting in what we call a “relative scattering \nintensity difference” (RSID) spectrum. \nNSS measurements of non-absorbing solutes \nTo illustrate the principle of NSS and its application as a method for the detection of solute \nconcentrations inside a nanofluidic channel, we consider two solutes that are transparent, i.e., do not \nabsorb light in the UV-Vis regime: NaCl and H2O2 dissolved in water (Figure 5).  To establish these \nexperiments, it is illustrative to first discuss the irradiated spectrum produced by the used LED white \nlight source and how it is affected by the optical elements in the experimental setup comprised of \nmicroscope, spectrometer and CCD camera, to understand the origin of specific features in the spectra \nobtained in our experiments. The light emitted from the LED has a relatively broad emission band \nspanning from 420 nm to 760 nm, with the highest intensity around 540 nm. In addition, there is a \nstrong peak at 450 nm (Figure 5a). However, when this light is scattered from a water-filled \nnanochannel, the maximum intensity of the scattered spectrum is significantly shifted when measured \nthrough our microscope system (Figure 5a and Figure S5). This is the consequence of (i) the spectral \nsensitivity of the CCD camera, (ii) the wavelength-dependent efficiency of the used grating in the \nspectrometer and (iii) the transmittance characteristics of other optical elements on the microscope, \nsuch as the objective (Figure S1). Together, they skew the emission spectrum of the lamp to longer \nwavelengths and thus, e.g., strongly decrease the 450 nm peak in the irradiated spectrum. However, \nwhen exchanging the water in the sample channels to a 5M NaCl solution, the overall shape of the \nscattered light spectrum obtained from a sample volume of about 1.2 fl (corresponds to the 30 µm long \nnanochannel section used) remains globally very similar, since there are no absorption bands for the \nNaCl solute (Figure 5a). Nonetheless, we notice sizable differences in scattered light intensity that are \nmost pronounced around 600 nm, which we can ascribe to the presence of the solute and the \ncorresponding change in RI of the solution. \n\n\n \n15 \nAs the next step, we extracted RSID spectra for seven different NaCl concentrations ranging from 0.25 \nM to 5 M in water, according to the procedure introduced in the previous section (Figure 5b). Due to \nthe lack of absorption bands of this solute, the obtained RSID spectra are broad and featureless, with a \nstrictly negative amplitude due to an increasing RI compared to pure water upon increasing solute \nconcentration. This amplitude is proportional to the solute concentration, as further quantified below. \nSimilar results are obtained when using H2O2 as the solute, however, with sizably different RISD \nmagnitudes (Figure 5c). These measurements demonstrate that concentration-dependent UV-Vis \nscattering spectra of a non-absorbing solute can be obtained from 1.2 femtoliter sample. If we consider \nhere the highest concentration of each solute, the number of molecules sampled in Figure 5b-c is 3.6∙109 \nfor NaCl and 7.2∙109 for H2O2, and for the lowest concentration it is 1.8∙108 and 3.6∙108, respectively. \n \nFigure 5. NSS of NaCl and H2O2 solutions. a) Incident emission intensity spectrum of the LED light \nsource prior to entering the microscope (green), this light scattered from a water-filled nanochannel \nmeasured through the NSS microscope setup (cyan), and this light scattered from a nanochannel filled \nwith a 5 M NaCl solution measured through the NSS microscope setup (black). All spectra have been \n\n\n \n16 \nnormalized to their maximum value in the wavelength range between 500 nm and 700 nm. RSID Spectra \nfor b) NaCl and c) H2O2 at different concentrations in water, as indicated by the labels. \n \nNSS measurements of light-absorbing and fluorescent dyes \nSince traditional UV-Vis spectroscopy is widely applied to determine solute concentrations, as well as \ncharacteristic fingerprints of molecules that exhibit absorption bands in the UV-Vis spectral range, we \nin the next step apply NSS to a selection of organic and fluorescent dyes, i.e., Brilliant Blue, Allura Red \nand Fluoresceine, in the concentration regime from 5 mM to 100 mM.  \n \n\n\n \n17 \nFigure 6. NSS of Brilliant Blue, Allura Red and Fluorescein solutions. a) Incident emission intensity \nspectrum of the LED light source measured directly, i.e. not through the microscope setup (green), this \nlight scattered from a water-filled nanochannel measured through the NSS microscope setup (cyan), \nand this light scattered from a nanochannel filled with a 100 mM Brilliant Blue solution measured \nthrough the NSS microscope setup (black). All spectra have been normalized to their maximum value \nin the wavelength range between 500 nm and 700 nm. RSID Spectra for b) Brilliant Blue, c) Allura Red \nand d) Fluorescein at different concentrations in water, as indicated by the legend. Each panel also \nincludes a scaled back- calculated scattering spectrum obtained from ASP measurements of the \nrespective dye solution.  \n \nStarting again at the level of the raw measured scattering spectra and taking a 100 mM Brilliant Blue \nsolution as the example, we notice that the distinct absorption bands of the dye are clearly reflected \nwhen comparing the spectra obtained from a water-filled and a dye-filled nanochannel (Figure 6a). \nSubsequently deriving the RSID spectra for the 1.2 fl sample volume (30 µm long nanochannel section) \nfor the entire concentration range reveals a systematic dependence of RSID intensity on concentration, \nas well as a distinct peak at 580 nm with a weaker “shoulder” at 630 nm, and a distinct negative peak \nat 680 nm (Figure 6b). These features correspond to rising and falling flanks in the absorption spectra \nof the dye (cf. Figure 2, Figure S3) and can be reasonably reproduced when calculating theoretically \nthe expected scattering spectrum of Brilliant Blue inside a nanochannel using the formalism derived \nabove, i.e., Equation 4 (dashed line in Figure 6b, see also Figure S3). The observed discrepancies \nbetween calculated and measured RSID spectra are most likely the consequence of the significant \nspectral modulation of the irradiated light intensity in our setup (cf. Figure 5a and corresponding \ndiscussion), which enhances or suppresses certain features relative to each other, depending on their \nspectral position. As a last point, we notice that for Brilliant Blue both positive and negative RSID \namplitude changes can be observed, because of positive or negative RI-differences induced by the \ndifferent absorption bands compared to pure water.  \nExecuting the same analysis for the dye Allura Red (Figure 6c) and the fluorescent dye Fluorescein \n(Figure 6d) in the same concentration range and the 1.2 fl sample volume generates overall very similar \nresults with reasonable agreement between calculated (see Figure S3) and measured RSID spectra, and \n\n\n \n18 \nwith distinct concentration dependence of the RSID signal amplitudes. We note that we don’t resolve \nthe slight positive RSID peak at for Allura Red predicted by the calculated spectrum. This is the \nconsequence of the dye’s small extinction coefficient and the low transmittance of our microscope setup \nin the wavelength range where the peak is expected to occur, as evident from Figure 6a. We also note \nthat for Fluorescein, we do not resolve a scattering band that would correspond to the 540 nm \nfluorescence emission line. The likely reason is that the number of emitted fluorescence photons is \nmuch lower than the number of scattered photons from the nanochannel since the number of fluorescein \nmolecules in the channel at the given concentrations is very low, i.e., on the order of 107 molecules.  \nTo put this number into perspective and compare NSS in this respect to typical solute concentrations \nand sample volumes used in ASP, we recall that in standard ASP cuvettes, with an optical path of 1 cm \nthrough the sample solution, the commonly used solute concentrations range from 1 - 10 µM (the range \nof concentrations used for the ASP dye spectra in Figure S3, see also our previous work49). Hence, \nassuming an irradiated light beam cross section of 1 cm2, the sample volume probed by the beam \ncorresponds to 1 cm3. With the given solute concentration range of 1 - 10 µM, this means that between \n3∙1015 to 3∙1016 molecules are sampled in a typical ASP measurement of a light-absorbing solute. In \ncontrast, for NSS, we operate in the 100 mM concentration range but with a sample volume of 1.2 fl \n(or ca. 8∙10-13 cm3) only. This translates to 72∙106 molecules probed in an NSS experiment at 100 mM \nconcentration and corresponds to a staggering 9 orders of magnitude reduction in the number of \nmolecules required. This, in combination with the fact that the NSS sample volume can be further \nreduced to the attoliter (al) regime by reducing the nanochannel dimensions and/or the channel section \nused for analysis, highlights the ability of NSS to work with very tiny amounts of sample substance. As \na proof for this point, we fabricated a fluidic system identical in structure to the one described above, \nbut now featuring sample nanochannels of 100 nm width and 180 nm depth with a total length of 120 \nµm. By then splitting the total length of the channel into longer (19 µm) and shorter (3.6 µm) segments \nand using Brilliant Blue dye across the 5 mM to 100 mM concentration regime, we reduced the sample \nvolume from which the RSID spectra are recorded to 340 al (20.5∙106 molecules @ 100 mM and \n1.025∙106 molecules @ 5 mM , Figure 7a) and 65 al (4∙106 molecules @ 100 mM and 2∙105 molecules \n\n\n \n19 \nat 5 mM, Figure 7b), respectively. Clearly, the spectral fingerprint of the dye is still resolved, also for \nthese tiny sample volumes. A comparison with the RSID spectra taken for the same dye concentrations \nin the larger nanochannels (cf. Figure 6b) reveals that the positions of the spectral features are identical, \neven though noise level increases and absolute RSID is decreased due to the smaller scattering cross \nsection of the smaller channel and the smaller number of molecules inside said smaller channel (Figure \nS6). Taken all together, these results corroborate the ability of NSS to resolve the distinct spectral \nfingerprints of dye molecules in the visible spectral for sample volumes in the attoliter to femtoliter \nrange, for concentrations in the 5 mM to 100 mM concentration regime. This corresponds to as few as \n2∙105 probed molecules only, which is 10 orders of magnitude fewer molecules as usually probed in \nestablished ASP. \n \nFigure 7. NSS from attoliter sample volumes. a) RSID spectra for different concentrations of Brilliant \nBlue in water taken from a 19 µm long section of a 100 nm x 180 nm channel, resulting in a sample \nvolume of 340 al. b) Same as a) but here spectra were taken from an only 3.6 µm long section of the \nnanochannel, reducing the sample volume to 65 al. \nConcentration dependence \nTo further develop the NSS concept with focus on quantitative information that can be extracted, we \nfocus on the concentration dependence of NSS spectra. As mentioned above, the proportionality \n\n\n \n20 \nbetween the RSID amplitude and the RI of the liquid in the channel (Equation 1, Equation S1) enables \nthe quantitative determination of the concentration of a specific solute in a nanochannel. To further \nexplore this opportunity, we plot the RSID amplitude extracted at the wavelength with the strongest \nresponse for each compound vs. the predetermined concentration for the five solutes investigated in this \nstudy (Figure 8a, b), i.e., H2O2 (RISD at 612 nm, Figure 8c), NaCl (RISD at 580 nm, Figure 8d), \nAllura red (RISD at 570 nm, Figure 8e) and Fluorescein (RISD at 510 nm, Figure 8f), Brilliant Blue \n(RISD at 665 nm, Figure 8g), again using the larger channels with the 1.2 fl sample volume. \nThe first key observation is that all data points across the 5 different solutes follow a linear relation to \na good first approximation since the range of RI change at hand is sufficiently small. This is in good \nagreement with the prediction in Figure 1e. Practically, this means that an NSS fluidic chip can be pre-\ncalibrated for concentration measurements of a specific solute and thus enable accurate measurements \nof the concentration dependence of solutes in sample volumes in the femtoliter regime and below.   \nThe second key observation is that each solute has a specific slope for this linear relation, which \ncorresponds to the change in scattering intensity per change in concentration at the given wavelength. \nWe find the smallest slope for H2O2 (-0.01 RSID/M) and the largest one for Brilliant Blue (-7.59 \nRSID/M), as shown in Figure 8a-b. The underlying reason for the different slopes exhibited by different \ncompounds is straightforward to understand for NaCl and H2O2, since they do not absorption light in \nthe visible regime. Hence, it is only the actual change of the real part of the RI that causes the change \nin RSID. At an absolute scale, the difference in slope between H2O2 (-0.01 RSID/M) and NaCl (-0.04 \nRSID/M) can be explained by considering the Lorentz-Lorenz formula that directly connects RI and the \npolarizability of the solutes61. To this end, in their investigation of the RI of salt water, Aly et al.61 \nconcluded that the RI of a solution is determined by the ratio of solute and solvent molecules but also \nby the molar polarizability of each species. Hence, based on the different slopes depicted in Figure 8a, \nit is clear that the molecular polarizability of NaCl in water is higher than that of H2O2. The reason is \nthe dissociation of NaCl into its charged ionic constituents, while H2O2 remains molecularly intact, \nwhich makes the dissolved Na+ and Cl- ions more responsive the to the external electrical field of light.  \n\n\n \n21 \nTurning to the dyes, which all exhibit strong absorption bands in the visible spectral range, the observed \nlarger slopes have their origin in the change in RI caused by the strong absorption in the visible regime. \nThis means that the slopes depicted in Figure 8b are directly connected to the molar extinction \ncoefficient, ε, for each solute, as shown in Table 1. \n \nDye \nRSID slope \n[RSID/M] \nε  \n[104 M-1cm-1] \nAllura Red \n-2.47 \n2.7862 \nFluorescein \n-3.43 \n7.6963–65 \nBrilliant Blue \n-7.59 \n13.066 \n \nTable 1. Comparison of RISD concentration slopes and the molar extinction coefficient, e, for the Allura \nred and Brilliant Blue dyes and for Fluorescein. \nThis clear connection between change in scattering intensity and molar extinction further illustrates \nhow compounds can be identified and quantified at the nanoscale using NSS, since a solute with a \nhigher molar extinction coefficient will have a higher amplitude in the RSID spectrum at the same \nconcentration.  \nAs second aspect of relevance here is the lowest concentrations of a specific solute that can be resolved. \nIt becomes clear from the RSID spectra of our five solutes taken at the three lowest concentrations, for \neach respective system in a 200 nm deep and wide nanochannel, that for the two non-absorbing solutes \nwe are approaching the limit of detection in the 250 – 500 mM range (Figure 8c, d), whereas for the \ndyes, the limit is roughly one order lower, i.e., in the low mM range or below (Figure 8e-g). If desired, \neither increasing the intensity of the irradiated light55 or increasing the nanochannel cross-section, since \nthe scattered intensity is proportional to channel dimensions (see Equation 1), will enable \nmeasurements at lower concentrations.  \n\n\n \n22 \n \nFigure 8. Solute concentration dependence. a) Comparison of the colorless solutes H2O2 and NaCl in \nterms of RSID change per change in concentration of the solute in the nanochannel for two independent \nmeasurement series. The symbols are data points taken at 580 nm (for H2O2) and 612 nm (for NaCl) \nwhere the RSID contrast is largest. The dashed lines are linear fits to the data points whose slope, s, is \nindicated as average of the two respective measurements. b) Same as a) but for the dyes Allura Red \n(measured at 570 nm), Brilliant Blue (measured at 665 nm) and Fluorescein (measured at 510 nm). \nThe respective peak positions given where used for all dye concentrations above 20 mM, where an \naverage of 10 data points around this position was taken. For concentrations lower than that, the peak \npositions seemed slightly shifted, so that the peak position for the evaluation was adapted (vertical \ndashed lines in c-g).  c - g) The RSID spectra for the three lowest concentrations of each solute together \nwith the peak position (black dashed lines) used for extracting the data points in a) and b). \n \nExtracting molar extinction coefficients from NSS spectra \nHaving established the ability of NSS to deliver quantitative information about solute concentration in \nthe molar to millimolar concentration range in femtoliter and attoliter sample volumes, as the last aspect, \nwe explore the possibility to determine the molar extinction coefficients of the solutes. To do this, we \nfirst reconnect to the beginning of this work, where we used the Kramers-Kronig relation (Equation 4) \nto analytically link the change in optical absorption of a solution to a corresponding change in its RI, \nwhich in turn is the reason for the scattering intensity difference measured by NSS. Using the same \n\n\n \n23 \nprinciple, it is possible to calculate a molar extinction spectrum from an RSID spectrum (which reflects \nthe underlying RI spectrum) produced by NSS. The detailed analytical derivation of the mathematical \nformalism is presented in SI Section II. In brief, the reverse calculation of molar extinction coefficients \nfrom RSID spectra consist of the following steps: i) Recalling that RSID is the ratio of the sample and \nreference channel scattering intensities, which means that it also is the ratio of the scattering cross \nsections of the sample and reference nanochannels (see Equation S1). ii) Using Equation 1 to relate \nthe scattering cross section of the nanochannels to the RIs of water (the solvent here), the solution itself, \nand the material the nanochannel is embedded in, i.e., SiO2). iii) Calculating the RI spectrum of the \nsolution and fitting a Cauchy-type curve to the obtained RI spectrum to enable subsequent subtraction \nof this “normal” dispersion from the “anomalous” dispersion, i.e., here the absorption bands of the dye \nthat we are interested in since they eventually translate into the extinction coefficient. To this end, the \nCauchy formula is a basic analytical description of the dispersion in a transparent medium67, whose \nsimplicity facilitates the separation of “normal” and “anomalous” dispersion in a reasonably \nstraightforward way. We note that for cases where the investigated spectral range extends further into \nNIR-regime, a fit of the Sellmeier-equation68 may be more appropriate. iv) Using the isolated change \nin the RI spectrum that stems from anomalous dispersion by the dye absorption bands and applying the \nKramers-Kronig formula to calculate an extinction coefficient spectrum. v) Calculating the molar \nextinction coefficient spectrum based on the known concentration of the solute in the solution. This \ncalculation is relatively straightforward, since all geometry-dependent factors can be cancelled out \nbecause reference and sample nanochannels have identical dimensions. However, we note that the \nquality of the Cauchy-fit to the RI spectrum is important when the molar extinction coefficient spectrum \nis to be calculated from scattering, since the presence of the dye molecules alone (irrespective of their \nspecific absorption bands) changes the RI of the solution, as shown for the non-absorbing solutes NaCl \nand H2O2. The fit therefore needs to include all contributions to the RI that do not stem from anomalous \ndispersion, such that they can be subtracted. However, this subtraction is challenging in practice since \nthe exact contribution of normal and anomalous dispersion is not known. Hence, the applied Cauchy-\nfit is to be regarded as a reasonable first approximation to the problem at hand, whose validity is \ncorroborated by the good agreement we obtain in terms of extracted extinction coefficients for all three \n\n\n \n24 \ndyes (Figure 9 and Figure S7). We also note that accurately knowing the RI of the surrounding material \n(a Borofloat 33 cover glass bonded to the thermal oxide of the silicon wafer in our case) is equally \nimportant since it directly determines the amplitude of the RSID spectra. This becomes evident from \nEquation 1, which states that the ratio of the RI of the channel content and the RI of the channel \nembedding matrix contribute almost quadratically, making NSS as sensitive to the RI outside of the \nchannel as to the RI inside it. \nWith these minor reservations, we now apply this formalism to the three dyes, to calculate their molar \nextinction coefficient spectra from the RSID spectra and compare them with the ones obtained from \ntraditional ASP (Figure 9a-c). Overall, we find very good agreement for all three dyes. For a more \ndetailed inspection, we first consider the spectra for Brilliant Blue and see that both the main absorption \npeak at 630 nm and the shoulder at 590 nm match well in the NSS and ASP spectra (Figure 9a). In \nparticular, the agreement in peak amplitude at 630 nm, and thus in absolute molar extinction coefficient \nfor the main dye absorption band, is excellent. Furthermore, we find that the 590 nm shoulder is more \npronounced in NSS when compared to the ASP spectrum, which we attribute to the specifics of the \nillumination spectrum in the NSS experiments that exhibits a peak at this position (cf. Figure 6a). The \nsmall peaks below 450 nm in Figure 9a appear offset by about 20 nm. As the reason, we argue that the \npeak at 450 nm in the NSS spectrum first and foremost stems from the peak in the irradiated light \nspectrum (cf. Figure 6a) since it overlaps with actual absorption peak of the dye at 412 nm. This \nconvolution of two contributions renders the peak in the NSS extinction coefficient spectrum slightly \nskewed to shorter wavelengths, which is the reason for the observed apparent offset.  \nTurning to Allura Red, we find the main absorption peak with both methods at 490 nm, and with \nexcellent agreement in terms of maximum amplitude and thus molar extinction coefficient for the main \nabsorption band (Figure 9b). The second peak at 540 nm, distinctly resolved by ASP, is less pronounced \nin the NSS spectrum. We attribute this primarily to the decreased scattering intensity in this area (cf. \nFigure 6a), but it could also be that the Cauchy-fit is distorting the resulting spectrum slightly, since \nthe exact contribution of the anomalous dispersion to the RI spectrum is unknown, as discussed above. \nFor Fluorescein (Figure 9c), the position of the main peak at 500 nm, as well as its amplitude, are in \n\n\n \n25 \nalmost perfect agreement for NSS and ASP. The amplitude of the shoulder on the short-wavelength-\nside of the main peak is slightly out of proportion, again due to the with the low light transmission \nthrough the microscope in this spectral range and the corresponding reduction of the S/N.  \n \nFigure 9. Molar extinction coefficient spectra obtained by ASP and NSS.  Molecular extinction \ncoefficient spectra for a) Brilliant Blue, b) Allura Red and c) Fluorescein, as measured using traditional \nASP (3.8 µM, 14 µM and 19 µM concentration, respectively - dashed lines) and obtained by NSS (solid \nlines) via the back-calculation from RISD spectra detailed in SI Section SII.  \nAs the last aspect, we briefly mention possible improvements to NSS as a method for the measurement \nof the molar extinction coefficient of solutes: i) More exact measurements of the RI of the matrix \nmaterial that surrounds the nanochannel; ii) Optimization of the fit to the contribution of the normal \ndispersion to the RI spectrum by, e.g. using a polynomial instead of a Cauchy curve; iii) Reduction of \nthe general noise level in the data by increasing the exposure time, the number of averaged spectra and \nthe intensity of the incident light, or by using a camera with lower background noise for recording; iv) \noptimizing the microscope setup and spectrometer grating to enable higher light transmission at shorter \nwavelengths to increase S/N in this range, and thereby better resolve spectral features in this regime.  \nConclusions \nWe have introduced Nanofluidic Scattering Spectroscopy, NSS, which measures visible light scattered \nfrom a single nanofluidic channel in a spectrally resolved way, as a tool for the spectroscopic \ninvestigation of colored and transparent solutions inside nanofluidic nanochannels in continuous flow \nfashion, and for sample volumes as small as a few tens of attoliters in the millimolar concentration \nregime, which corresponds to as few as 105 probed molecules. As a further key step beyond the state of \n\n\n \n26 \nthe art, we have implemented two independent fluidic systems on the used chip. The first one served as \nthe sample system through which different sample solutions were introduced, whereas the second one \nconstituted an optical reference system filled with water at all times, which we used to compensate for, \ne.g., fluctuations in irradiated light intensity during a measurement. In this way, we were able to \nimplement a similar concept on a nanofluidic chip as widely used in dual-beam spectrophotometers to \nestablish long-term stable measurement conditions. On the examples of the non-absorbing solutes NaCl \nand H2O2, and the dyes Brilliant Blue, Allura Red and Fluorescein, we subsequently demonstrated that \ntheir spectral fingerprints can be obtained with good accuracy and that solute concentrations inside a \nsingle nanochannel can be determined based on NSS-spectra from femto- to attoliter sample volumes. \nFurthermore, by applying a reverse Kramers-Kronig transformation to measured NSS-spectra of solutes \ninside a single nanochannel, we demonstrated that the molar extinction coefficient spectrum of the \nsolute can be extracted with very good agreement with literature values, thereby enabling the \nidentification of solutes based on a fundamental material constant.  \nLooking forward, our findings advertise NSS as a versatile tool for the spectroscopic analysis of solutes \nin situations where nanoscopic sample volumes, as well as continuous flow measurements, are of \nimportance. An example for such a situation is single particle catalysis inside nanofluidic channels, \nwhich has the aim to resolve catalytic conversion on the surface of a nanoparticle localized inside the \nnanochannel by preventing excessive dilution of the reactant products due to the tiny volume of said  \nnanochannel45,49,69,70 To this end, for this application, we have already demonstrated the key importance \nof limiting the detection to a fraction of a nanochannel46 and argue that adding the spectroscopic \ndimension enabled by NSS further leverages the potential of single particle catalysis in nanofluidic \nsystems as a whole. Furthermore, since it is possible to realize various concentration, temperature and \npressure scenarios inside nanofluidic systems, we envision that the NSS concept also may find \napplication in homogeneous catalysis, where, e.g., the absorption of photosensitizers71 could then be \ninvestigated on only fractions of the usual sample volume, or in biological sample sequencing and \nmedical drug development where costly molecules initially are available in tiny amounts and volumes \nonly. To reduce the total sample volume required in such experiments, i.e., the volume equivalent to \n\n\n \n27 \nthe entire fluidic system connecting to the nanochannels and not only the nanochannels themselves, the \nmicro-and nanofluidic concepts employed offer ample opportunities as they easily can be downscaled \nin their entirety.   \nMethods \n \nInstruments \nThe exchange and flow of solutions in/through the nanofluidic chip was realized by applying pressure \nto the inlet reservoirs of the chip holder with a Fluigent MFCS-EX pressure controller.  The dark-field \nmicroscopy images were taken on a Nikon Eclipse LV150N upright microscope equipped with a Nikon \n50x ELWD dark-field objective. Illumination was provided by a Thorlabs Solis-3C LED light source. \nThe light scattered from the nanochannels was directed into an Andor spectrometer (SR-193I-A-SL) \nthat had a 150 l/mm grating installed. The spectrally resolved light was recorded with a Andor Newton \n(DU920P-BEX2-DD) camera attached to the spectrometer, which binned the four areas (upper and \nlower reference channels and upper and lower signal channels) to a total of four spectra, which were \nused for subsequent data evaluation. The spectra were recorded with 2 s exposure time and consisted of \n10 accumulated pictures. For Figure 5 and 6, additional spectra of the incident light were recorded using \nan Avantes AvaSpec-1024 fiber spectrometer. ASP spectra of the dyes were recorded on a Varian Cary \n50 Bio UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The SEM images of the channel and its cross-section were recorded \non a Zeiss Supra 55VP scanning electron microscope.  \nSample preparation \nAll dyes (Allura Red, Brilliant Blue, Fluorescein) were bought from Merck as solid material and diluted \ninto the required concentrations by mixing the dyes with ultrapure water (Milli-Q IQ 7000 water \npurification, Merck). A similar procedure was carried out for NaCl and H2O2, where the latter one was \nacquired as solution (H2O2, 35% w/w in H2O, Merck). Injection into the fluidic chip holder was done \nwith syringes and blunt needles (Braun). \nFluidic chip fabrication  \nThe micro and nanofluidic chips used in the experiments were fabricated in the clean room facilities of \nMC2 at Chalmers in Gothenburg. Each chip consisted of a single 4-inch silicon wafer with a thermal \n\n\n \n28 \noxide layer into which the fluidic structures were etched. The general procedure is described in detail \nin our earlier work by Levin et al49. As a short summary: The 4-inch (100) silicon wafers were cleaned \nwith Standard Clean 1, followed by a 2% HF bath and Standard Clean 2. Growing of the thermal oxide \nlayer was carried out in wet atmosphere at 1050 °C until a thickness of 250 nm was reached. Etching \nof the nanochannels was done via fluorine-based reactive ion etching (RIE) after they have been \npatterned in a resist layer by electron beam lithography. Subsequently, the microchannels were etched \ninto the thermal oxide by the same method, the photoresist was patterned here with direct laser \nlithography. As a final step, the substrates were cleaned with Standard Clean 1, together with a 175 µm \nthick Borofloat 33 glass wafer to be used as lid of the fluidic system. This glass lid has been equipped \nwith inlet holes (sandblasting) to match the liquid reservoir on the nanofabricated wafer. The surfaces \nof both wafers were then treated with O2 plasma (50 W, 250 mTorr) to enable pre-bonding of the glass \ncover lid to the wafer with the fluidics. The subsequent fusion bonding was carried out at 500 °C for \n5h. After bonding the 4-inch fluidic wafer was cut into shape to fit the chip holder. \n \n \nSupporting Information \nThis material is available free of charge via the Internet at http://pubs.acs.org. \nSchematic of the experimental setup, Nanochannel scattering cross section dependence on wavelength \nand RI, Spectra of Brilliant Blue, Allura Red and Fluorescein during the analytical transformation from \nabsorption spectra to scattering spectra, Intrinsic scattering spectra and evaluation strategies, Spectra of \nthe light used during the experiment, Comparison of spectra from different channel sizes, Calculation \nof the molar extinction coefficient from measured RSID spectra.

Schematic of the experimental setup. The illuminating polychromatic white light is emitted \nby a broad-spectrum LED-lamp (Thorlabs Solis 3C) and collimated into the microscope (Nikon Eclipse \nLV150N). Here, it is partly blocked by a ring aperture that transmits only a ring-shaped section of the \nlight onto a ring-shaped mirror, from where it is directed into the dark-field objective (TU Plan ELWD \n50x/0.6 B OFN25 WD 11). As the objective is specifically built for dark-field illumination, it has a \nseparate light path for the incident light, at the end of which a ring-shaped lens focuses the light in the \nfocus spot of the imaging path. Here, a set of lenses collects the scattered light into a collimated beam \nthat then is directed into the spectrometer (Andor SR-193I-A-SL), where a grating (150 l/mm) separates \nthe individual wavelength components. The spectra are finally recorded by a CCD camera (Andor \nNewton DU920P-BEX2-DD). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nFigure S2. Nanochannel scattering cross section dependence on wavelength and RI. The three panels \nshow how the scattering cross section, of a 200 nm by 200 nm nanochannel embedded in SiO2 (for \nwhich the RI is calculated for each wavelength according to Malitson et. al.1) depends on the \nwavelength of the incident light and the RI of the medium that fills the channel, for different \npolarizations of the incident light respectively. The color code axis is given in logarithmic units with \nbase ten. a) For unpolarized light, the scattering cross section of the channel (𝜎!\"#$$%&) shows a \nminimum around the RI of SiO2, i.e. n = 1.459 at 600 nm, since in this case the channel and its \nsurrounding medium form an optically uniform body. Deviations from this value lead to an increase in \nthe 𝜎!\"#$$%& for all wavelengths. For shorter wavelengths, 𝜎!\"#$$%& increases more rapidly to higher \nvalues. For RIs of the channel that are larger than the surrounding material, 𝜎!\"#$$%& increases slightly \nmore than when compared to the same RI difference for a channel with lower RI (see also Figure 1e in \nthe main text). b) For light that is polarized orthogonal to the channel, the overall result is the same as \nin a), with the exception that 𝜎!\"#$$%& is not as large as in the unpolarized case. c) For light that is \npolarized parallel to the nanochannel the overall 𝜎!\"#$$%& is larger than in the other two cases. \nEspecially remarkable here is the increase of 𝜎!\"#$$%& when the channel has a higher RI than the \nsurrounding material, which becomes even more significant when considering shorter wavelengths. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nFigure S3. Spectra of Brilliant Blue, Allura Red and Fluorescein during the analytical \ntransformation from absorption spectra to scattering spectra. a) to c) The absorbance spectra as \nmeasured with absorption spectrophotometry (ASP) using an Varian Cary 50 Bio instrument are here \nshown as absorption coefficient spectra, which can be calculated by dividing the measured absorbance \nvalues by the optical path through the sample solution (here 1 cm) and by log(e). The subsequent \ncalculation of the extinction coefficient κ is done with Equation 3 in the main text. d) to f) Using κ in \nthe Kramers-Kronig relation (Equation 4 in the main text) yields the change of the real part of the \nrefractive index (RI) caused by the respective absorption features of each type of dye molecule in the \nsolution. Applying then Equation 1 from the main text delivers the scattering cross section, \n𝜎!\"#$$%&,()&*+,)$, of a nanochannel filled with the corresponding dye solution and corresponding \nconcentration. Subtracting from 𝜎!\"#$$%&,()&*+,)$ the scattering cross section, 𝜎!\"#$$%&,-#+%., of a \nwater-filled channel yields the difference in scattering cross section, ∆σ, which is proportional to the \nobserved difference in scattering intensity (RSID). The calculated spectra for ∆σ are used as a \nqualitative benchmark in the comparison with the experimental RSID spectra since the dye \nconcentrations used in the nanochannels are too high to be measured with ASP. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nFigure S4. Intrinsic scattering difference and comparison of evaluation strategies. a) Intrinsic \nscattering difference spectra for two independent measurement series of the dyes Brilliant Blue and \nFluorescein (100 mM) as used for Figure 6b,d and Figure 8b. The intrinsic scattering difference is \nhere defined as the ratio of the scattering intensity of a water-filled sample channel and the scattering \nintensity of its corresponding water-filled reference channel. The colors indicate to which of the two \nsubsequent RSID measurements of Brilliant Blue (blue) and Fluorescein (yellow) they belong, which \nare shown in b) and c) respectively. b) RSID spectra for two independent measurements of a 100 mM \nBrilliant Blue solution in a 200 nm by 200 nm channel. The solid lines show the result when the intrinsic \nscattering difference is subtracted (as described in the main text, Figure 4), while the dashed lines are \nthe result when instead division by the intrinsic scattering difference is used. c) Same as for b), however, \nfor a 100 mM Fluorescein solution. \n \n \n \n\n\n \nFigure S5. Spectra of the light used during the experiment, scaled to their maximum between 500 \nnm and 700 nm. The initial incident light spectrum (red line) measured with an Avantes AvaSpec-1024 \nspectrometer is emitted from a Thorlabs Solis-3C LED light source. It undergoes several changes \nregarding the shape of the spectrum during its course through the experimental setup. The light source \nis a broad-band LED-lamp, that has its main intensity centered around 550 nm but also an additional \nstrong peak at 450 nm. After being focused on the fluidic system, the light scatters on the fluidic \nchannels (green line, scattering from a microchannel wall for intensity reasons, recorded with an \nAvantes AvaSpec-1024 spectrometer). Here we see that the spectral shape of the lamp is not maintained. \nMost remarkable is the dip that has appeared at 540 nm but also the peak at 450 nm has decreased in \nrelative size. We assume that thin-film interference in the SiO2 layer of the fluidic chip causes these \nchanges. After being scattered from a water-filled nanochannel (cyan line, measured with a Andor SR-\n193I-A-SL spectrometer and a Andor Newton DU920p-BEX2-DD camera), the shape of the spectrum \nhas again changed, now being more bell-shaped with a maximum at 650 nm. We see the main cause for \nthis in the sensitivity of the grating spectrometer and the camera. The peak at 450 nm is now greatly \ndiminished when compared to the original spectrum. When the nanochannels are now filled with a dye \n(Brilliant Blue as example), the spectrum changes again in shape according to the change in absorption \nand RI as explained in the main text. All spectra have been normalized to their maximum value in the \nwavelength range over 500 nm. \n \n \nFigure S6. Comparison of RSID spectra measured from nanochannels with different dimensions. \nRSID spectra for three different Brilliant Blue concentrations measured in a nanochannel with 200 nm \nx 200 nm cross section (continuous lines) a nanochannel with 100 nm x 180 nm cross section (dashed \nlines). \n\n\nSection II: Supplementary derivations \n \nCalculation of the molar extinction coefficient from measured RSID spectra \nIn the main text, we explained how the expected relative scattering intensity difference (RSID) spectrum \ncan be calculated from the absorbance spectra of the respective dyes. Here, we will outline the reverse \nprocess leading to Figure 9 in the main text. As a first step, we need to establish the connection between \nRSID and scattering cross section of the nanochannel, 𝜎!\"#$$%&. The scattered power, 𝑃(!#+, is the \nproduct of incident intensity, 𝐼,$!,/%$+, and 𝜎!\"#$$%&. The RSID as shown in the main text is the \nscattering spectra recorded from the solution-filled channels divided by the scattering spectra from the \nwater-filled channel but then also with the intrinsic difference spectrum subtracted. To amend this, we \nadd an ideal intrinsic difference spectrum for a ratio, which is 1, to the RSID spectra (see Figure S7a-\nc). Here, the shaded area below 425 nm for all graphs indicates the wavelength range where the intensity \nof the incident light and the sensitivity of the spectrometer and camera is insufficient to conduct a \nmeasurement of RSID. \n \n𝑅𝑆𝐼𝐷+ 1 = 𝑃(!#+,()&*+,)$\n𝑃(!#+,-#+%.\n= 𝐼,$!,/%$+𝜎!\"#$$%&,()&*+,)$\n𝐼,$!,/%$+𝜎!\"#$$%&,-#+%.\n= 𝜎!\"#$$%&,()&*+,)$\n𝜎!\"#$$%&,-#+%.\n \nEquation S1 \nAs second step, we consider the scattering cross section, 𝜎!\"#$$%&, of a nanochannel as given by \nEquation 1 in the main text, but as a simplification consider here only incident light that is polarized \nparallel to the nanochannel, as it is the main contributor to the scattering intensity (see Figure 1e). \n \n𝜎0 =\n1∅\n\"2#3\n4\n(𝑚5 −1)5. \nEquation S2 \nWith this expression at hand, we can write the RSID as a ratio of scattering cross sections, were the \ngeometry and wavelength dependent pre-factor vanishes, and were we substitute 𝑚 again as the ratio \nof RIs of the solution in the channel and the SiO2 the channel is embedded in. \n \n𝑅𝑆𝐼𝐷+ 1 = 𝜎!\"#$$%&,0,()&*+,)$\n𝜎!\"#$$%&,0,-#+%.\n=\n01𝑛()&*+,)$\n𝑛6,75 3\n5\n−14\n5\n01𝑛-#+%.\n𝑛6,75 3\n5\n−14\n5  \nEquation S3 \nSolving this equation for 𝑛()&*+,)$ provides four solutions, of which we will continue with the following \nas it is not resulting in negative values for 𝑛()&*+,)$and applies to the case where 𝑛-#+%. < 𝑛6,75. \n \n𝑛()&*+,)$ = 67(𝑅𝑆𝐼𝐷+ 1)8𝑛-#+%.\n5\n−𝑛6,75\n5\n9\n5 + 𝑛6,75\n5\n \nEquation S4 \nUsing here the literature values for the RIs for water2 and SiO21, we arrive at the RI spectra for the \nrespective solutions, as shown in Figure S7d-f. It is seen clearly that the dye solutions have RIs  larger \nthan water (𝑛857  =  1.333 at 600 nm). The absorption bands of the dyes appear as deviations from the \nsmooth, Cauchy-type curve (yellow dashed line) fitted to the RI spectra. In the presented calculation, it \nis assumed that the respective dye solutions do not have any absorption in this regime and follow a \nnormal Cauchy dispersion. This assumption enables the fitting of a Cauchy-type function in Figure \nS7d-f. This fit is necessary for the next step of our transformation of RSID to molar extinction \ncoefficient, since only the RI features caused by the absorption bands of the dyes are of interest in the \nKramers-Kronig relation (and the corresponding inverse relation) and since the RI spectrum, in addition \nto the features related to the absorption bands, contains contributions that are not related to absorption, \nwhich we need to subtract that part using the Cauchy-fit to estimate it.  \n\n\nThe Cauchy-formula is commonly used as a simple description of the normal dispersion relation of \ntransparent media in the visible regime, making it useful to us here to separate normal from anomalous \ndispersion (which is the extinction of the dye). To do so, we need to note that due to the fact that the \nKramers-Kronig relation contains an integral, the whole RI spectrum experiences a change because of \nthe anomalous dispersion, which is most pronounced for the longer wavelengths3. The Cauchy-fit is \ntherefore based on the section of the RI curve that is below 400 nm. Furthermore, to include the overall \nincrease of the RI for all wavelengths as mentioned above, we estimated this contribution to be 0.01 RI \nunits and subtracted it from the initial fit (grey dashed line in Figure S7d-f) such that the extracted \ncontribution of the normal dispersion (grey line) happens to be lower than the baseline of the calculated \nRI spectrum of the dyes. This estimate seems to be reasonable, as it is in line with our understanding of \nthe Kramers-Kronig relation for the normal and anomalous dispersion of a dye solution and reproduces \nthe expected result sufficiently well. \n \nFigure S7. Translation of RSID to molar extinction coefficient. The shaded sections of the spectra \nindicate the wavelength regime where low incident light intensity and insufficient spectrometer and \ncamera sensitivity prevent a measurement of RSID. a)-c) The RSID spectra from the experiment (cf. \nFigure 6b-d, dashed lines) for a 100 mM Brilliant Blue, Allura Red and Fluorescein solution, \nrespectively. The colored solid lines are RSID+1 spectra and represent the ratio of scattering cross \nsections as laid out in Equation S1. d)-f) Using Equation S4, the RSID (which is the ratio of scattering \ncross sections) can be translated into the RI spectrum of the respective dye solution (colored lines). To \nextract the part of the RI spectrum that describes normal dispersion and that is not associated with the \nabsorption bands of the solute, a Cauchy-type fit (grey dashed line) is applied to the RI spectrum and \nthe estimated contribution of the normal dispersion (grey line) is later subtracted from the RI curve of \nthe solution. g)-i) Molar extinction coefficient spectra for the three dyes obtained by reverse Kramers-\nKronig transformation (colored lines, Equation S5) plotted together with the molar extinction \ncoefficient spectra obtained for the same dyes using traditional ASP (green lines). We note the generally \ngood agreement between NSS-based and ASP spectra. The unphysical negative molar extinction \ncoefficients obtained by converting the Brilliant Blue NSS data (g) between 700 nm and 800 nm, comes \n\n\nmost probably from the long-wavelength contribution of the anomalous dispersion to the normal \ndispersion that is not represented in the Cauchy-fit The molar extinction coefficients also become \nnegative for all dyes below 300 nm, but here we assume that the high noise and low intensity of the \nscattered signal is responsible for this unphysical deviation. \nThe inverse Kramers-Kronig relation for the real and imaginary part of the RI (of which the imaginary \npart correspond to extinction) is nearly identical in structure to Equation 4 in the main text, except for \na minus sign in front and can be used to calculate the wavelength-dependent extinction coefficient as  \n \n𝜅(𝜆) = −2\n𝜋𝒫A\n𝛥𝑛(𝜆´)\n𝜆´ D1 −1𝜆´\n𝜆3\n5\nE\n𝑑𝜆´\n9:\n;\n \nEquation S5 \nAs the very last step, we can then convert the obtained extinction coefficient spectrum , 𝜅(𝜆), into the \nmolar extinction coefficient spectrum, 𝜀(𝜆) by using the known concentration of 𝑐= 100 𝑚𝑀 in \nEquation S6 for each solution. \n \n \n𝜀(𝜆) = 4𝜋𝜅(𝜆)\n𝜆 𝑐\n \nEquation S6 \nThe final result of this calculation is shown in Figure S7g-i, together with the molar extinction \ncoefficients for the respective dyes that have been measured using ASP. The agreement is relatively \ngood regarding the main peak positions and the maximum value of the molar extinction coefficient 𝜀 \nfor all three dyes. The values for 𝜀 do deviate from the ASP spectra slightly but we identify the main \nreason for this in the separation of the normal and anomalous dispersion as explained above. The  \nCauchy-fit of the RI spectrum for each respective dye solution may not represent the actual underlying \nnormal dispersion (associated with the real part of the RI of the solution), as it may not fully represent \nall involved influences of the dye extinction on the total RI. For the shorter wavelengths below 300 nm, \npoor signal quality due to low scattering intensity can also be considered as reason for these deviations. \nFurthermore, the RI of the surrounding SiO2 plays a critical role during the calculation, since even a \nsmall change in the chosen value has a sizable impact on the final result, since NSS is as sensitive to \nthe RI in the channel as to the RI outside of the channel, as laid out by Equation 1 in the main text. \n \nReferences \n1. \nMalitson, I.

Here, we show how Nanofluidic\nScattering Spectroscopy, NSS, which measures visible light scattered from a\nsingle nanochannel in a spectrally resolved way, can reduce this sample volume\nto the attoliter range for solute concentrations in the mM regime, which\ncorresponds to as few as 105 probed molecules. The connection of the\nnanochannel to a microfluidic in-and outlet system enables such measurements in\ncontinuous flow conditions, and the integrated online optical reference system\nensures their long-term stability. On the examples of the non-absorbing solutes\nNaCl and H2O2, and the dyes Brilliant Blue, Allura Red and Fluorescein, we\ndemonstrate that spectral fingerprints can be obtained with good accuracy and\nthat solute concentrations inside the nanochannel can be determined based on\nNSS-spectra. Furthermore, by applying a reverse Kramers-Kronig transformation\nto NSS-spectra, we show that the molar extinction coefficient of the dye\nsolutes can be extracted with excellent agreement with the literature values.\nThese results thus advertise NSS as a versatile tool for the spectroscopic\nanalysis of solutes in situations where nanoscopic sample volumes, as well as\ncontinuous flow measurements, are critical, e.g., in single particle catalysis\nor nanoscale flow cytometry.",
