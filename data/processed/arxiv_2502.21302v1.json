Multiple mechanisms related to efficiency loss are independently \nexamined, including injection efficiency, carrier density vs. current density relationship, phase space filling (PSF), \nquantum confined stark effect (QCSE), and Coulomb enhancement. An optimal QW thickness of around 2.7 nm in \nthese InGaN/GaN LEDs was determined for quantum wells having constant In composition. Despite better control of \ndeep-level defects and lower carrier density at a given current density, LEDs with thin QWs still suffer from an \nimbalance of enhancement effects on the radiative and intrinsic Auger-Meitner recombination coefficients. The \nimbalance of enhancement effects results in a decline in internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and radiative efficiency \nwith decreasing QW thickness at low current density in LEDs with QW thicknesses below 2.7 nm. We also investigate \nhow LED modulation bandwidth varies with quantum well thickness, identifying the key trends and their implications \nfor device performance.  \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n*Electronic mail: xuefengli@ucsb.edu \n\n\n \n2 \nThe significant efficiency loss in green InGaN/GaN LEDs is a challenge for solid-state lighting and is often referred \nto as the “green gap” [1].  The emission wavelength of an LED is primarily determined by the quantum well (QW) \nthickness and the indium composition. Our recent study demonstrated that commercial-grade LEDs with 3-nm-thick \nQWs, but with different indium compositions, do not exhibit a significant decrease in growth quality with higher \nindium composition. However, a strong increase in carrier density was observed at a given current density for longer \nwavelength LEDs [2], leading to efficiency loss at higher indium compositions. Furthermore, we also reported that \nthe effect of deep-level defect-related nonradiative recombination is very limited in 3 nm InGaN/GaN LEDs with \ncommercial-grade epitaxy, while the intrinsic Auger-Meitner process remains the dominant nonradiative mechanism \nassociated with the green gap [3]. Along with indium composition and defect density, QW thickness is also a crucial \nparameter that impacts quantum efficiency in InGaN/GaN LEDs. In commercial LEDs, QW thicknesses greater than \n3.0 nm are usually avoided due to the high density of deep-level defects introduced by the large lattice mismatch \nbetween InGaN and GaN layers [4,5]. In addition, thick QW LEDs exhibit strong quantum-confined stark effect \n(QCSE) and small wavefunction overlap [6-9], which have been shown to significantly increase the carrier density \nand therefore exacerbate intrinsic Auger-Meitner recombination [10-13]. The use of thin QWs in InGaN/GaN LEDs \nis known to help to mitigate QCSE and may provide benefits by lowering the carrier density, but such designs require \na higher indium composition for a given wavelength compared to designs with thicker QWs and may face other \nlimitations. Thus, a systematic study of the effect of QW thickness on carrier behavior and efficiency loss in \ncommercial-grade LEDs is essential for identifying the limiting factors and providing practical solutions to increase \nefficiency in InGaN/GaN LEDs. \n \nIn this work, we study a series of c-plane InGaN/GaN LEDs with various QW thicknesses, grown with state-of-the-\nart growth conditions using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The LED series includes six wafers \nwith identical indium compositions (19% based on energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements), but \ndifferent QW thickness that range from 2.1 nm to 3.6 nm. The barriers consist of 18-nm-thick GaN layers. Although \nthe LEDs have 3X, 3-nm-thick QWs, the carrier recombination is limited to a single QW next to the p-GaN [2, 3]. \nDetailed information on the emission wavelengths and carrier densities at 40 A/cm2 for the LED series is given in \nTable 1.  \n\n\n \n3 \nSmall-signal electroluminescence (SSEL) [14, 15] was used to study the carrier dynamics in the LEDs in Table 1. \nSSEL is a technique based on electrical injection that analyzes the impedance and modulation response of LEDs. \nDetails regarding the SSEL setup and process can be found in Ref. 2 and 15. Multiple carrier dynamics parameters \nrelated to carrier recombination and transport can be acquired using SSEL, including carrier density, lifetime, and \nrecombination rate. In the SSEL circuit model utilized in this work, differential injection efficiency (𝜂∆\"#$) is defined \nas the ratio of carriers that recombine in the active region, rather than carriers injected into the active region, to the \ntotal carrier injection in the LED. Injection efficiency (𝜂\"#$) can be acquired via integrating 𝜂∆\"#$ [16]. \nQW thickness \n[nm] \nWavelength @ 40 A/cm2 \n[nm] \nn @ 40 A/cm2 \n[cm-3] \n2.1 \n465 \n4.57 × 10%& \n2.4 \n487 \n7.83 × 10%& \n2.7 \n504 \n1.10 × 10%' \n3.0 \n523 \n1.68 × 10%' \n3.3 \n539 \n2.46 × 10%' \n3.6 \n570 \n4.79 × 10%' \n \nTable 1. QW thickness, emission wavelength, and n @ 40 A/cm2 in the LED series. \n \nAs shown in Figure 1(a), the injection efficiency is higher in LEDs with thinner QWs, and only small differences are \nobserved at high current densities. The low injection efficiency in LEDs with thicker QWs results from relatively \nslower carrier recombination rates in the active region and increased carrier recombination in the cladding layer [16]. \nThe internal quantum efficiency (IQE) in Figure 1(b) was obtained from Lumileds by measuring the external quantum \nefficiency (EQE) of LEDs with known light extraction efficiency (LEE). The IQEs maintain similar values for QW \nthickness of 3.0 nm and lower but decrease notably for QW thickness of 3.3 nm and 3.6 nm, especially at low current \ndensity. The radiative efficiency (𝜂() was derived from the IQE (𝜂)*+) and injection efficiency (𝜂\"#$) using 𝜂)*+ =\n𝜂\"#$ ∗𝜂(, and is shown in Figure 1(c). Similar trends were observed in radiative efficiency as in IQE. The significant \ndecline in IQE and radiative efficiency in LEDs with QW thickness greater than 3.3 nm is likely due to higher densities \nof deep-level defects in thick QWs.  \n\n\n \n4 \n \nFIG. 1. (a) Injection efficiency, (b) IQE, and (c) Radiative efficiency vs. J in LEDs with different QW thickness.  \n \nThe relationship between carrier density (n) and current density (J) is an important factor in the efficiency of \nInGaN/GaN LEDs since it not only determines how carriers are converted into current, but also affects the relative \ncontributions of the various recombination mechanisms at a given J. Maintaining a lower n is advantageous for \navoiding strong intrinsic Auger-Meitner recombination and for preventing significant efficiency loss at high J. The \nresults for the n vs. J relationship [16] are shown in Figure 2(a). LEDs with thinner QWs have higher recombination \ncoefficients due to weaker QCSE and larger wavefunction overlap. Thinner QWs maintain lower carrier density, \nindicating that the effect of a thinner QW is not the dominant factor that increases n. Vice versa also holds, where \nthicker QWs do not necessarily lead to smaller n. Instead, the increase in recombination coefficients and decrease in \ncarrier lifetime are the dominant factors affecting carrier density. The n values at 40 A/cm2 in the QW thickness LED \nseries are shown in Table 1. Notably, the corresponding n value at 40 A/cm2 increases by 10.5X when the QW \nthickness increases from 2.1 nm to 3.6 nm. A similar analysis of the 𝑛 vs. J relationship for other LED series can be \nfound in Ref. 2 and 3. \n \nIn Figure 2(b), we plot 𝜂( vs. n. LEDs with thin QWs have lower radiative efficiency at a given n. The decline in \nradiative efficiency at low J in LEDs with QW thicknesses below 2.7 nm, as shown in Figure 1(c), correlates with a \nmore significant difference at low n in the  𝜂( vs. n plot, as shown in Figure 2(b). In Figures 2(c) & (d) and 2(e) & (f), \nwe show the radiative and nonradiative recombination lifetimes (𝜏( and 𝜏#() and rates (𝑅( and 𝑅#(), respectively. \nLEDs with thin QWs have shorter recombination lifetimes and faster recombination rates, which are related to the \nlarger wavefunction overlap and other enhancement mechanisms, which will be discussed in the next section.  \n \n\n\n \n5 \n \nFIG. 2. (a) Carrier density (n) vs. current density (J), (b) Radiative efficiency vs. n, (c) & (d) Radiative and nonradiative lifetimes \nvs. n, and (e) & (f) Radiative and nonradiative recombination rates vs. n in LEDs with different QW thickness.  \n \nThe recombination coefficients, 𝐴(𝑛), 𝐵(𝑛), and 𝐶(𝑛) can be acquired by plotting 𝑅#( 𝑛\n= , 𝑅( 𝑛,\n=\n, and (𝑅#( −𝐴𝑛)\n𝑛-\n=\n, \nrespectively, as shown in Figure 3 [17]. Here, 𝐴 is the value of 𝐴(𝑛) at low 𝑛. Although higher deep-level defect \ndensities are expected in thick QW LEDs, 𝑅#( 𝑛\n=  remains lower compared to thin-QW LEDs. This discrepancy can \nbe attributed to the strong QCSE and small wavefunction overlap in thick QWs [6-9]. We bracket the range of the 𝐴 \nparameter since 𝑅#( 𝑛\n=  doesn’t converge to a flat trend at low n in the carrier density range measured here. The 𝐵(𝑛) \ncoefficient is derived from 𝑅( 𝑛,\n=\n and shows strong enhancement at low n in LEDs with QW thickness below 3.0 nm. \nThis enhancement is typically attributed to carrier localization and Coulomb enhancement in thin QWs, characterized \nby strong internal electrical field and localized carriers [2, 3, 18]. In the 3.3 nm QW LED, limited enhancement of the \n𝐵(𝑛) coefficient was observed at low n, accompanied by some screening effect at high n. The 3.6-nm-QW LED shows \n\n\n \n6 \nno enhancement of the 𝐵(𝑛) coefficient at low n but shows a strong screening effect at high n. The 𝐶(𝑛) coefficient \nis derived from (𝑅#( −𝐴𝑛)\n𝑛-\n=\n and shows a strong enhancement at low n in LEDs with QW thickness less than 2.7 \nnm. In Figure 3, the spread in the 𝐶(𝑛) coefficient values result from the previously discussed bracketed range of 𝐴 \nvalues. A significant enhancement of the 𝐶(𝑛) coefficient was observed at low n in QWs with thickness below 2.7 \nnm, consistent with a similar behavior reported in 2.5 nm QWs [19]. To the best of our knowledge, no other \nenhancement effects on recombination coefficients at low n have been reported, except for the effect of carrier \nlocalization and Coulomb enhancement on the 𝐵(𝑛) coefficient in thin-QW LEDs [18]. Further work is needed to \ndetermine why 𝐶(𝑛) is enhanced at low n. In our view, a likely explanation is the many-body Coulomb enhancement \ndue to electron-hole correlations [20, 21], which correspond to composite electron-electron-hole or hole-hole-electron \nquasiparticles. This interaction is suppressed by the polarization field for thicker wells. However, a theoretical analysis \nof tronic Coulomb enhancement effects on the 𝐶(𝑛) coefficient is challenging due to  the complexity of the simulation \nand has not been reported. If carrier localization and Coulomb enhancement were to primarily influence the 𝐵(𝑛) \ncoefficient and not the 𝐶(𝑛) coefficient for some QW thicknesses, we would anticipate a rise in radiative efficiency \nat low J. Notably, while an enhancement effect on 𝐵(𝑛) was observed in the 3.0 nm QW LED, no such effect was \nobserved on 𝐶(𝑛), indicating that a QW thinner than 3.0 nm may be required to observe the enhancement effect on \n𝐶(𝑛). \n\n\n \n7 \n \nFIG. 3. (a)-(c) 𝑅#( 𝑛\n= , 𝑅( 𝑛,\n=\n, and (𝑅#( −𝐴𝑛)\n𝑛-\n=\n in LEDs with different QW thickness.  \n \nWe previously showed that the influence of deep-level defect-related recombination mechanisms is small within the \nstudied J range in similar commercial-grade LEDs with 3 nm QWs [3]. Hence, the radiative efficiency at high J can \nbe approximated as: \n𝜂( =\n𝐵(𝑛)𝑛,\n𝐵(𝑛)𝑛, + 𝐶(𝑛)𝑛- =\n1\n1 + 𝐶(𝑛)\n𝐵(𝑛) 𝑛\n(1) \nThere are only two factors that contribute to the radiative efficiency in the high J range:  𝐶(𝑛)\n𝐵(𝑛)\n@\n and 𝑛. As shown \nin Figure 1(c), the radiative efficiencies for 2.1 nm, 2.4 nm, and 2.7 nm QW LEDs are nearly identical at high J. Since \n𝑛 is lower in LEDs with thin QWs, as shown in Figure 2(a), the ratio 𝐶(𝑛)\n𝐵(𝑛)\n@\n is higher in LEDs with thin QWs for \na given radiative efficiency at high J.  \n \n\n\n \n8 \nWith the recombination coefficients obtained in Figure 3, we now calculate 𝐶(𝑛)\n𝐵(𝑛)\n@\n, as shown in Figure 4. Due to \nthe strong screening effect observed in 3.6 nm LED, the corresponding values of 𝐶(𝑛) shown in Figure 3(c) are less \naccurate, and we do not calculate 𝐶(𝑛)\n𝐵(𝑛)\n@\n for that LED. Here, we observe that LEDs with thinner QWs have higher \nvalues of 𝐶(𝑛)\n𝐵(𝑛)\n@\n, consistent with the analysis related to equation 1. Additionally, we observe a different trend in \n𝐶(𝑛)\n𝐵(𝑛)\n@\n vs. n for LEDs with different QW thickness. For example, in the 3.0 nm QW LED, 𝐶(𝑛)\n𝐵(𝑛)\n@\n increases \nslightly at higher n. Conversely, 𝐶(𝑛)\n𝐵(𝑛)\n@\n shows a decreasing trend at a higher n in the 2.1 nm QW LED.  \n \nFIG. 4. 𝐶(𝑛)/𝐵(𝑛) vs. n in LEDs with QW thickness of 2.1 nm, 2.4 nm, 2.7 nm, 3.0 nm, and 3.3 nm.  \n \nQW thickness also affects the -3dB bandwidth in the LEDs series, as shown in Figure 5(a). Generally, LEDs with thin \nQWs have wider -3dB bandwidths. Notably, there is an increase in the -3dB bandwidth with decreasing J in thin-QW \nLEDs, such as in the 2.1 nm and 2.4 nm QW LEDs. The same behavior has been observed in thin-QW high-speed \nLEDs [22]. We can investigate the impact of carrier recombination and escape on the bandwidth to gain insight into \nthe bandwidth trends. As the effect of parasitic resistance is small [23], the modulation response (𝑆,%) can be expressed \nas:  \n𝑆,% = −10𝑙𝑜𝑔%. E1 + 𝜔,𝜏∆(/0\n,\n1\nG1 + 𝜏∆(/0\n𝜏∆/10H\n,I + 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡\n(2) \n\n\n \n9 \nHere, 𝜔 is the driving frequency. Then, 𝑆,%(𝜔-23) = 𝑆,%(𝜔= 0) −3𝑑𝐵 and the modulation bandwidth (𝜔-23) of \nthe device is: \n𝜔-23 =\n1\n𝜏∆(/0\n+\n1\n𝜏∆/10\n=\n1 + 𝜏∆(/0\n𝜏∆/10\n𝜏∆(/0\n(3) \nTherefore, the modulation bandwidth is primarily determined by the differential recombination lifetime (∆𝜏(/0), as \nshown in Figure 5(b), and the ratio between the differential recombination and escape lifetimes (\n4∆\"#$\n4∆#%$), as shown in \nFigure 5(c). 𝜏∆(/0 is relatively constant in thin QWs at low J due to the strong enhancement effect and weak QCSE, \nleading to an increase in the modulation bandwidth of thin-QW LEDs at low J when \n4∆\"#$\n4∆#%$ increases. For example, \nwhen \n4∆\"#$\n4∆#%$ is comparable to or larger than 1 (below ~10 A/cm2), the modulation bandwidth will be increased in the \nthin QWs. Thus, the interplay between carrier recombination and escape in thin QWs produces the trend in Figure \n5(a). Strong carrier escape at low J has been previously reported and attributed to weak Coulomb-enhanced capture \ninto the QWs [14]. Similar behavior has also been observed in semipolar LEDs [16]. We do not observe an increase \nin modulation bandwidth at low J for thick-QW LEDs because the modulation bandwidth behavior is dominated by a \nstrong increase in 𝜏∆(/0 at low J as described by equation 3 and shown in Figure 5(b). \nWe can gain further insight into radiative recombination by plotting the quantity 𝐵(𝑛)𝑛. As shown in Figure 5(d), this \nquantity shows a decreasing trend with increasing QW thickness and remains relatively stable with changes in n in \nthin QWs. The fact that 𝐵(𝑛)𝑛 is stable at low n for thin quantum wells indicates monomolecular recombination, \nwhich can be a signature of excitons, related to the Coulomb enhancement effect. However, some studies show an \nincrease followed by a decrease in quantum efficiency with increasing J in similar thin QWs [19, 24], which is difficult \nto explain with an excitonic model. Additionally, the properties of excitons in disordered InGaN/GaN QWs were \nnumerically investigated, and carriers with excitonic behavior account for less than 25% of the total carriers in 2-nm-\nthick QWs [25]. In thick QW LEDs, 𝐵(𝑛)𝑛 declines at low n because the enhancement of the 𝐵(𝑛) coefficient is \nlimited, owing to suppression of the Coulomb enhancement by polarization fields. \n\n\n \n10 \n \nFIG. 5. (a) -3dB bandwidth, (b) 𝜏∆(/0, (c) 𝜏∆𝑟𝑒𝑐𝜏∆𝑒𝑠𝑐\n(\n, and (d) 𝐵(𝑛)𝑛 in LEDs with different QW thicknesses.  \n \nAs discussed earlier, we also observe a lower IQE and radiative efficiency with decreasing QW thickness below 2.7 \nnm in the low J region, as shown in Figure 1(b) and 1(c). To gain insight into this, we focus the following analysis \nonly on the low n range. There are multiple mechanisms that affect the recombination coefficients, such as phase space \nfilling (PSF) [17], QCSE [6-9], carrier localization [1, 26-31], and Coulomb enhancement [2, 18]. Notably, the PSF \neffect is weak at low n, especially in LEDs with thin QWs [17, 32], thus it was excluded from the low n analysis. \nAdditionally, the influence of trap-assisted Auger-Meitner processes on the radiative efficiency is negligible at low n \nin LEDs with state-of-the-art growth conditions [3]. Therefore, at low n, the radiative efficiency can be expressed as: \n𝜂( =\n𝐵.(𝑛)𝑛,𝐼9(𝑛)\n𝐴.(𝑛)𝑛𝐼:(𝑛) + 𝐵.(𝑛)𝑛,𝐼9(𝑛) + 𝐶.(𝑛)𝑛-𝐼0(𝑛)\n(4) \nHere, 𝐼(𝑛) represents wavefunction overlap in LEDs, and 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 account for the dependence of SRH, radiative, \nand intrinsic Auger-Meitner processes on wavefunction overlap. 𝐵.(𝑛) and 𝐶.(𝑛) only consider the effects of carrier \nlocalization and Coulomb enhancement, excluding QCSE (which is accounted for in 𝐼(𝑛)), on radiative and intrinsic \n\n\n \n11 \nAuger-Meitner processes. 𝐴.(𝑛) also excludes the effect of QCSE. After simplifying equation 4, the radiative \nefficiency can be written as: \n𝜂( =\n1\n1 + 𝐴.(𝑛)𝐼:;9(𝑛)\n𝐵.(𝑛)𝑛\n+ 𝐶.(𝑛)𝑛𝐼0;9(𝑛)\n𝐵.(𝑛)\n=\n1\n1 + 𝐴.(𝑛)𝐼:;9(𝑛)\n𝐵.(𝑛)𝑛\n+ 𝑛𝐶.(𝑛)\n𝐵.(𝑛)\n(5) \nThe effect of wavefunction overlap is similar on both radiative and intrinsic Auger-Meitner processes, i.e., 𝑏≈𝑐 [2, \n7, 31]. Therefore, 𝐼0;9(𝑛) ≈1.  \n \nWe now investigate why decreasing the QW thickness decreases the radiative efficiency at a given n, as shown by the \narrow in Figure 2(b). In a previous work, we showed that defect-mediated recombination is small in commercial-grade \nLEDs with 3 nm quantum wells [2,3]. If we assume that this conclusion also holds for thinner quantum wells, then the \ndecline in efficiency with decreasing thickness could be solely attributed to an increase in 𝐶(𝑛)\n𝐵(𝑛)\n@\n, as shown in \nFigure 4. One explanation for this is well-width fluctuations, which are always present even in commercial-grade \nquantum wells. Such fluctuations have a stronger influence on the electronic structure of thinner wells, which could \nexacerbate 𝐶(𝑛) by relaxing crystal-momentum conservation. Although there is no experimental evidence from the \npresent work, defect-mediated recombination, corresponding to the \n<&(#))'()(#)\n3&(#)#\n term in equation 5, could also \nsignificantly impact the quantum efficiency in thin QWs. While David et al. have shown that the scaling exponent 𝑎−\n𝑏 is approximately -0.1 for certain high quality quantum wells in the 2.5 nm to 5 nm thickness range [32], the scaling \nexponent can depend on the precise distribution of defects. If defects are clustered near the interface where electrons \nare confined by the polarization field, one might even observe superlinear scaling, where the defect-mediated term \nincreases more dramatically than radiative recombination as the quantum well thickness decreases. (see supplementary \ndiscussion) The term 𝐴.(𝑛), which depends on the multi-phonon-mediated capture coefficient can also have a non-\ntrivial dependence on the quantum-well thickness as polarization fields can non-trivially influence the energetics of \ntrap levels, i.e., shift a shallow defect into the mid-gap or vice versa. (see supplementary Figure S1) To our knowledge, \nthis effect has not been previously considered, and further research is needed to determine whether the decline in \nradiative efficiency for thinner wells is an intrinsic limitation, or an extrinsic issue that can be mitigated through novel \ndesign paradigms. \n\n\n \n12 \nIn summary, we studied carrier dynamics in a series of InGaN/GaN LEDs with varying QW thickness ranging from \n2.1 nm to 3.6 nm using SSEL. The optimal QW thickness for LED efficiency in this study is around 2.7 nm, which \nprovides a good balance among injection efficiency, deep-level defect density, carrier-current density relationship, \nand carrier localization and Coulomb enhancement. As QW thickness increases, injection efficiency decreases, the \ncarrier density increases radically, and likely additional deep-level defects are introduced during growth. Conversely, \nwe observed a decline in IQE and radiative efficiency in the thinnest of the studied QWs, along with an increase in -\n3dB bandwidth with decreasing J, both in a similar low J region in LEDs with thin QWs (less than 2.7 nm). In the \npresent work, the data show that the imbalance of enhancement effects on the 𝐵(𝑛) and 𝐶(𝑛) coefficients and the \ninfluence of carrier escape are the primary reasons for the efficiency reduction and bandwidth trends observed in these \nthin-QW LEDs at low current density. Future work should also consider the potential role of defect-mediated \nrecombination in thin QWs.  \nSee the supplementary material for scaling exponent of SRH and radiative recombination. \nThis work was supported by the Department of Energy under Award No. DE-EE0009163.  \n1 M.

To evaluate the influence \nof the spatial position of the traps, we set 𝑛B(𝑧) = 𝛿(𝑧−𝑍I). Then, \n𝑅?@A ∝𝑐#𝜓/(𝑍I) × 𝑐H𝜓J(𝑍I)\n 𝑐#𝜓/(𝑍I) + 𝑐H𝜓J(𝑍I)\n(1) \nLikewise, the radiative rate is proportional to the following overlap, 𝑅( ∝Y∫𝑑𝑧 𝜓/\n∗(𝑧)𝜓J(𝑧)Y\n,. In a polar quantum \nwell, we can approximate the wave function as 𝜓/(𝑧) ∼exp G\nD;L\nM# H and 𝜓/(𝑧) ∼exp G−\nL\nM,H, where 𝜉 is the spatial \nextent of the wave function and 𝐿 is the quantum well width. Since 𝜉J ≪𝜉/ in III-nitride quantum wells [2], we can \nsimplify the radiative rate as follows, \n𝑅( ∝|𝜓/(0)|, ∼exp b−2𝐿\n𝜉/\nc\n(2) \nSimilarly, we simplify the SRH rate as follows. Since we would like show that defects localized near 𝑧= 𝐿 can give \nrise to a super-linear relation between 𝑅?@A and 𝑅(, we set 𝑍I ≈𝐿 and substitute the exponential approximation for \nthe wave functions, which yields, \n𝑅?@A ∝\nexp G−2𝐿\n𝜉JH\n1 + 𝑐H\n𝑐# exp G−2𝐿\n𝜉JH\n(3) \n\n\n \n15 \nRecognizing that the localization length is inversely proportional to the effective mass according to the Agmon relation \n[2], we write the following relation, 𝜉J ≈d\nN#\nN, 𝜉/. Combining this result with equation (2) and substituting into \nequation (3), we find, \n𝑅?@A ∝\nexp b−d𝑚J\n𝑚/\n2𝐿\n𝜉/ c\n1 + 𝑐H\n𝑐# exp b−d𝑚J\n𝑚/\n2𝐿\n𝜉/ c\n∼\n𝑅(\nON,\nN#\n1 + 𝑐H\n𝑐# 𝑅(\nON,\nN#\n(4) \nFor illustrative purposes, we set 𝑐H ≪𝑐#. In this limit, the expression can be further simplified as, \n𝑅?@A ∝𝑅(\nON,\nN#\n(5) \nSince 𝑚J ≈10 𝑚/ in InGaN, this shows that the SRH rate can scale superlinearly with the radiative recombination \nrate. Hence, in principle, the SRH rate can increase more rapidly than the radiative recombination rate as the quantum \nwell thickness decreases. While beyond the scope of the present work, this effect should be further investigated in \nfuture works.   \n \nFIG. S1. Influence of polarization fields on trap levels.

The imbalance of enhancement effects results in a decline in\ninternal quantum efficiency (IQE) and radiative efficiency with decreasing QW\nthickness at low current density in LEDs with QW thicknesses below 2.7 nm. We\nalso investigate how LED modulation bandwidth varies with quantum well\nthickness, identifying the key trends and their implications for device\nperformance.",
