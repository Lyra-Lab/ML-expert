Comb Sign is an important imaging biomarker to detect mul- \ntiple gastrointestinal diseases. It shows up as increased blood flow along \nthe intestinal wall indicating potential abnormality, which helps doctors \ndiagnose inflammatory conditions. Despite its clinical significance, cur- \nrent detection methods are manual, time-intensive, and prone to subjec- \ntive interpretation due to the need for multi-planar image-orientation. To \nthe best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a fully automated \ntechnique for the detection of Comb Sign from CTE scans. Our novel \napproach is based on developing a probabilistic map that shows areas \nof pathological hypervascularity by identifying fine vascular bifurcations \nand wall enhancement via processing through stepwise algorithmic mod- \nules. These modules include utilising deep learning segmentation model, \na Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), vessel extraction using vesselness \nfilter, iterative probabilistic enhancement of vesselness via neighborhood \nmaximization and a distance-based weighting scheme over the vessels. \nExperimental results demonstrate that our pipeline effectively identifies \nComb Sign, offering an objective, accurate, and reliable tool to enhance \ndiagnostic accuracy in Crohn’s disease and related hypervascular condi- \ntions where Comb Sign is considered as one of the important biomarkers. \n \nKeywords: Crohn’s Disease · CT Enterography · Comb Sign · GMM · \nAutomated Detection · Vesselness Filter \n \n1 \nIntroduction \nThe Comb Sign is a critical imaging biomarker observed in a wide range of gas- \ntrointestinal conditions—including acute Crohn’s disease, mesenteric vasculitis, \nradiation enteritis, graft-versus-host disease, chronic ischemic bowel, and ulcer- \native colitis [8,19]. It appears as the increased linear vascular densities along \nthe mesenteric side of the affected small bowel segments on contrast computed \ntomography enterography (CTE) images, resembling the teeth of a comb [14,15]. \nThe presence of comb sign helps distinguish hypervascular inflammatory dis- \norders from hypovascular diseases such as lymphoma or metastasis [25]. The \n\n\n2 \nGupta et al. \n \n \nmotivation for its detection becomes even more critical when differentiating be- \ntween Crohn’s Disease (CD) and Intestinal Tuberculosis (ITB). Many clinical, \nendoscopic, and imaging findings overlap between these conditions. Since ITB \nrequires anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) while CD requires immunosuppressive \ntherapy, misdiagnosis can lead to catastrophic consequences. Therefore, detect- \ning the comb sign, an indicator of mesenteric hypervascularity, serves as a crucial \nbiomarker to distinguish between these two diseases [1,2,3,4,10,16,26,9]. \n \nIn order to detect comb sign in CTE scans, we need to detect intestinal wall \nenhancement that represents affected bowel segment and find the density of the \nincreased number of blood vessels near the enhanced wall. Current clinical prac- \ntice for comb sign detection relies on manual pattern recognition, often requiring \nsubjective synthesis of multiple imaging features [6,11,25]. However, the complex \nintestinal anatomy makes it difficult to orient CTE scans in multiple planes to \ndiagnose the comb sign. Also, the vascular features, such as linear densities, can \nbe very subtle and easily missed without careful inspection. Moreover, reviewing \nmultiple CTE images and synthesizing intestinal and extra-intestinal findings \n(like bowel wall thickening, skip lesions, and lymphadenopathy) makes manual \ndetection labor-intensive. In addition, the manual interpretation may be sub- \njective and highly dependent on the radiologist’s experience and sophisticated \nmachinery, leading to variability in detection [5,17,18,23]. \n \nThe manual comb sign detection practices lack objective quantification of \nsubtle vascular changes and impose difficulty in scalability for high-volume clin- \nical workloads. These limitations can directly be addressed through automated \nanalysis. Existing computer-aided diagnosis systems have methods to extract \nvessels from gastrointestinal imaging [5,12]. However, in order to detect the comb \nsign, we need to locate blood vessels in enhanced intestinal walls. To our knowl- \nedge, there is no algorithm available to detect enhanced intestinal walls. \n \nTo overcome these challenges, we propose AutoComb, a fully automated novel \nframework to detect the Comb Sign with high accuracy and efficacy. Our pro- \nposed framework pipeline has five steps: 1) Extraction of abdominal organs using \ndeep learning TotalSegmentator tool to precisely isolate the intestinal regions in \nCTE [27], 2) Intestinal wall estimation using Gaussian Mixture Model by ana- \nlyzing the intensity histogram of the segmented bowel, 3) Extracting vascular \nstructures using an optimized Jerman vesselness filter to capture fine vessel bi- \nfurcations, 4) Enhanced refinement of vascular structures to mitigate edge arti- \nfacts via edge blurring and neighborhood maximization, and 5) Development \nof probabilistic map for comb sign detection using distance-based vesselness \nweights. We developed and validated this pipeline based on CT scans for 36 CD \nand 57 ITB patients collected from the hospital. Code will be updated in the \ngiven \nlink: \nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/CombSignDetection-326D/ \nREADME.md. \n\n\nAutoComb: Automated Comb Sign Detector for 3D CTE Scans \n3 \n \n2 \nMethods \n \nThe Comb sign is a key feature that supports the diagnosis of Crohn’s disease. \nIt is an indicator of the areas which have a high probability of intestinal wall \nenhancement and identifies the increased number of abdominal blood vessels. We \nuse both of these clinical findings to develop a probabilistic mask representing \nComb sign. Mathematically, the Comb sign detection can be expressed as, \nP (voxel ∈ comb sign) = P (voxel ∈ vessels) × P (voxel near enhanced wall) (1) \nTo identify these probabilities to detect the comb sign, we developed a novel \npipeline involving 5 main steps, as explained in the following sub-sections. \n \n2.1 \nExtraction of Abdominal organs using Deep Learning \nWe employed TotalSegmentator [27]—a deep learning-based U-Net [24] tool—to \nsegment the intestine from CTE images. From the complete set of segmentation \nmasks generated by TotalSegmentator, we extracted the masks corresponding to \nthe duodenum, small bowel, and colon. Initially, we applied a dilation to the mask \nto remove prominent segmentations of adjacent organs, using varying dilation \nradii (e.g., 2 voxels for the bowel and 4 voxels for other abdominal organs). \nThese segments were then merged to create a comprehensive mask representing \nthe entire intestine. This mask enabled us to isolate the intestinal volume from \nthe original CTE DICOM files. \n \n2.2 Intestinal Wall Estimation using Gaussian Mixture on \nBowel-histogram \nCurrently, there is no method that can accurately estimate the intestinal wall. \nOur approach is an approximate algorithm with reasonable accuracy. We analyze \nthe histogram depicting the intensity of intestinal volume, measured in terms of \nHounsfield units (HU) in CTE scans. We randomly sampled CTE scans of 50 out \nof 99 patients from Hospital A for this analysis. The histogram is then modeled \nusing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with four Gaussian components, as \ndepicted in Figure 1. The Gaussian with the highest mean corresponds to the \nintestinal wall, the next higher mean corresponds to the intestinal content, the \nsubsequent Gaussian accounts for fat due to imperfect segmentations including \nmesenteric fat and occasionally intramural fat, and the lowest mean captures \nresidual variations. To determine the optimal number of Gaussian components, \nwe employ the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), defined as: \nBIC(k) = −2 ln(Lk) + k ln(N ) \n(2) \nwhere k is the number of Gaussian components, Lk is the maximized likelihood of \nthe GMM with k components, N is the number of data points in the histogram. \n\n\n4 \nGupta et al. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 1: Histogram of intestinal intensities (measured in HU). Red curves repre- \nsent the indivisual gaussians, blue curve represent the recontstructed curve after \nmerging gaussians, green lines represent the means while curve made by black \nbars is the actual historgram of intensities. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2: BIC Plot to select optimal number of Gaussians averaged over all patients \nin Hospital A. (4 was the optimal number based on the “knee”). \n\n\nAutoComb: Automated Comb Sign Detector for 3D CTE Scans \n5 \n \n \nWe calculate the BIC for k ranging from 1 to 9 and plot the results in Figure \n2. The ‘knee’ in the BIC plot occurs around k = 4, indicating that a four- \ncomponent GMM provides an optimal balance between model complexity and \nfit quality. Based on this analysis, we select four Gaussians for our model. We set \nthe HU threshold at the intersection point of the Gaussians with highest mean \n(intestinal-wall) and next highest mean (intestinal-contents). The algorithm cap- \ntures the intuitive distinctions between the HU values of fat, the intestinal wall, \nand intestinal contents using the threshold value. Figure 4a represents the orig- \ninal CTE image, while figure 3a represents the extracted intestinal wall. \n \n2.3 Blood Vessel Extraction using Vesselness filter \nWe aim to extract blood vessels from the CTE scans using a state-of-the-art \nvessel enhancement filter (a.k.a. vesselness filter). To avoid any false positives, \nwe have removed prominent body organs by setting their intensity to zero based \non segmentations generated by TotalSegmentator. To avoid any edge artifacts, \nwe blur the edges of organs after dilation so that the removed volume does not \nappear sharp and does not introduce vessel-like edge artifacts. The remaining vol- \nume was then processed with a vesselness filter to obtain an accurate estimation \nof the vessels. We evaluated several vesselness filters [7,11,12,13,20,21,22,25,28]. \nWe found that the Jerman filter [11] outperformed the others, being known to \naccurately model bifurcations. As a pre-requisite for the Jerman filter, all voxels \nmust have positive HU values. In order to meet this requirement, HU values were \nclipped between the soft tissue range (HU = 350) and fat range (HU = -200), \nand subsequently rescaled by adding a constant so that the minimum HU value \nbecomes 0. Visceral fat was included in the analysis because fine vessel structures \nare present in mesenteric fat, which are important for comb sign estimation. The \noutput image after this step is shown in figure 3b. \n \n2.4 Iterative Probabilistic Enhancement of Vesselness via \nNeighborhood Maximization \nWhile vesselness filters effectively detect vessels, they often produce false posi- \ntives far from true vessel locations, necessitating additional post-processing. To \naddress this, we propose an iterative method that enhances fine vessel detec- \ntion by propagating high vessel probabilities from robust regions to adjacent \nlow-probability voxels. In our approach, an initial vessel probability map is com- \nputed using a vesselness filter, followed by iterative dilation cycles as described \nin Algorithm 1. In Step 3, the maximum probability within each voxel’s 27- \nneighborhood is determined to identify local regions of high vessel likelihood. \nIn Step 4, the probability at each voxel is updated via geometric interpolation \nbetween its original value and the computed local maximum, weighted by the \nparameter λ, to ensure a smooth transition that reinforces continuous vessel \nstructures. Finally in Steps 5 and 6, noise is suppressed by reducing the bot- \ntom 5th percentile values and those below a preset threshold to zero, thereby \nrefining the vessel map.

The final \nmap, P (K)(x), effectively propagates high vessel probabilities from larger, well- \ndetected vessels to adjacent finer structures, as illustrated in Figure 3c. \n \n \n2.5 Comb-sign detection using distance-based vesselness weights \n \nBased on equation (1), we aim to merge the probabilities of voxels belonging to \nvessels and voxels close to the enhanced wall to obtain the final probability map \nfor detecting the comb sign. We are trying to assign weights to voxels such that, \n(1) voxels in close proximity to thick walls get more weight than thin walls and \n(2) voxels far away from the wall get lesser weight than voxels close to the wall. \nThis process helps us to detect the enhanced wall in the intestine. In practice, \nthis is achieved by convolution with a kernel that has values that decrease as we \nmove away from the center, and we use a Gaussian kernel for our case. This is an \napproximation since, apart from thick walls, regions where there are intestines \non all the sides could also give a higher probability. However, empirically, such \nregions are rare and unlikely to impact the final comb-sign. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) Original Section \nshowing comb-sign \nnear enhanced bowel \n(mid-right of image) \n(b) \nProbability \nplot \nof \nenhanced \nintestinal-wall with \nhigher probabilities \nnear the enhanced \nwalls that decrease \nwith distance. \n(c) Efficient detec- \ntion of Comb-Sign \nwithout \ninvolving \nother \nartifacts; \nhigher \nprobability \nmeans higher proba- \nbility of comb-sign \nFig. 4: Result of detecting comb-sign. We can find that the module is able to \ndetect only the hyper-vascularity close to enhanced-bowel. \n\n\n8 \nGupta et al. \n \n \nCombining the aforementioned steps, we generate a probabilistic map where \nhigher probability values indicate a higher likelihood of the voxel being a part of \na comb sign. The factors namely vessel-like structure, connection to prominent \nvessels and proximity to thick intestinal walls, give an estimate of comb sign. \nWe use this probability map to visualise the possible sites of comb sign. For \nprominent locations where comb sign is generally observed, we compute the \naverage probability of voxels over the area to predict if it is a comb-sign or not. \nFigure 4a shows the original section with comb sign, figure 4b shows probability \nplot of intestinal-wall enhancement and figure 4c shows final detected comb sign. \n \n3 \nResults \nTo enhance clinical interpretability and facilitate rapid diagnosis, we plot the \nour automated comb sign probability map as overlay onto the original 3D CTE \nscans. As shown in figure 5, regions with high probabilities of pathological hy- \npervascularity—indicative of the comb sign—are rendered in a distinctive red, \nwhile the segmented intestinal wall is shown in contrasting tones, and other \nanatomical structures (such as mesenteric fat) are highlighted in supplementary \nhues when applicable. This layered, multi-planar display not only illustrates the \noutputs from our deep learning segmentation, GMM-based wall estimation, and \niterative vessel enhancement modules but also provides radiologists with clear, \ninterpretable visual cues that help identify features potentially missed during \nmanual analysis. The preliminary feedback from clinical experts indicates that \nthis visualiser can be a valuable asset for corroborating automated findings and \nimproving diagnostic confidence.

Our approach integrates TotalSegmentator \nfor intestinal segmentation, Gaussian Mixture Modeling for wall estimation, and \nan optimized vesselness filter enhanced by a proposed iterative post-processing \nalgorithm, culminating in a detailed probabilistic map of hypervascular regions. \nThe incorporation of a distance-based weighting scheme further refines prob- \nabilistic map for wall-enhancement, ensuring precise localisation of the comb \nsign. Experimental findings and preliminary clinical evaluations demonstrate \nthat AutoComb not only improves detection efficacy but also offers clear visual \nexplanations that support radiological decision-making. \n \nReferences \n1.
