Lotnik´ow 32/46, 02-668 Warsaw, Poland\n1\narXiv:2502.20983v1  [astro-ph.CO]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\n2\nG Kaur, M Bilicki, W Hellwing & WAVES\nThe main scientific goal of WAVES is to study the halo mass function at sig-\nnificantly lower galaxy and halo masses in the low-redshift Universe as compared\nto previous surveys like the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA, [3]). In WAVES\nwe plan to do so in two sub-surveys: Wide and Deep. Here we focus on the Wide\nsurvey (WW), with the fiducial spectroscopic selection being 𝑍-band magnitude\n(central wavelength 0.88 𝜇𝑚) upper limit of 21.1, and redshift limit of 0.2 [2]. The\nsuccess of the survey will be determined by its completeness, with a target value of\n95% or higher. The flux-limited selection is easy to achieve, as fluxes are readily\navailable from internal WAVES reprocessing of the KiDS+VIKING imaging data.\nHowever, redshift-limited selection for a survey which by design aims at measuring\nthe redshifts themselves is challenging. The general approach for such a selection\nwould be photometric redshift-based selection.\nThe photometric redshift can be generally estimated via template-fitting or\nmachine-learning methods. However, irrespective of the approach, the resulting scat-\nter is unlikely to be significantly smaller than 𝜎𝑧∼0.02(1 + 𝑧) for the broad-band\nphotometry we have [4]. At the redshift selection limit of 0.2, this would roughly\ntranslate to a completeness of 90%, which is much lower than what is desired by the\nsurvey.\nAlso, for the sake of WW target selection, we only need to know if the galaxy lies\nbelow the redshift of 0.2 or not, rather than estimate the redshift directly. Therefore,\nwe employ a supervised machine-learning classification algorithm, XGBoost, to\nestimate the probability of the galaxy lying within the redshift limit.\n2 Data\n2.1 Input photometry\nThe input imaging is from KiDS [5] 𝑢𝑔𝑟𝑖and VIKING [6] 𝑍𝑌𝐽𝐻𝐾𝑠as used to\nproduce the KiDS final Data Release 5 [7]. The original imaging has been reprocessed\nfor WAVES purposes with ProFOUND [8] using an approach similar to that of\nBellstedt et al. (2020) [9]. The star-galaxy separation for the input catalogue has been\ndescribed in Cook et al. (2024) [10]. To avoid the issue of data missing at random\nfor the machine learning algorithm, we only select galaxies having detections in all\nthe 9 photometric bands. After applying all the cuts, we are left with 14, 060, 220\ngalaxies in the flux limited selection (𝑍< 21.1 mag).\n2.2 Spectroscopic labels\nThe input photometric catalog was cross-matched with overlapping spectroscopic\nsurveys such as GAMA, SDSS, zCOSMOS, etc. The input spectroscopic surveys\nand datasets are identical to those detailed in Jalan et al. (2024) [11] and Wright et\n\n\nTarget Selection for WAVES wide\n3\nal. (2024) [7]. We combine them into a single parent catalog following the method\noutlined in the former paper.\nThe spectroscopic cross-match contains 572, 325 galaxies at the fiducial 𝑍-band\nmagnitude limit of 21.1, and has a median redshift of 0.25. This spectroscopic sample\nserves as the training and test set for the machine learning classifier.\n3 Methodology\nAs previously mentioned, we address the problem of WW target selection as a\nclassification task. Specifically, we assign class ‘0’ to the desired targets (those below\nthe specified 𝑍-magnitude and redshift thresholds) and class ‘1’ to those above the\nredshift limit. To achieve this, we adopt a supervised machine learning approach,\ntrained on galaxies with true labels derived from the spectroscopic data of Sec. 2.2.\nMore specifically, we utilize a tree-based algorithm, which is both computationally\nefficient and well-suited for binary classification tasks. Additionally, our method\nenables the estimation of the probability of an object being assigned to a particular\nclass.\nFor target selection, we employ the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) clas-\nsifier using Python’s scikit-learn library [12]. The xgboost library is integrated\nvia the Scikit-Learn API to implement the XGBoost model.\nWe split the spectroscopic cross-match into training and testing sets. We use the\nXGBoost classifier with default hyperparameters. To check for the efficiency of the\nclassification of Class ‘0’, we used Purity, Completeness, and F1 score (harmonic\nmean of the two former) as the metrics.\n4 Results\n4.1 Feature Importance\nOur features are 9-band 𝑢𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑍𝑌𝐽𝐻𝐾𝑠magnitudes and all the possible colors. In\norder to find out the most important features for the classification, we shuffled the\nvalues of each feature in the test 30 times and measured the average decrease in\nthe F1 score. The feature importance scores for the 11 most important features are\nshown in Fig. 1(a). It is clear from the figure that the 𝑔magnitude mag gc and the\nassociated 𝑔−𝑟and 𝑢−𝑔colors are the most important. This is likely due to the\nfact that for the WW limiting redshift of 0.2, the 4000 ˚A break passes through the\nVST 𝑔-band filter.\n\n\n4\nG Kaur, M Bilicki, W Hellwing & WAVES\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 1: (a) Feature importance for our classifier, computed as relative decrease in the\nF1 score when the features are shuffled.

The vertical dashed line\nis the redshift threshold.\n4.2 Classification metrics\nThe purity, completeness, and F1 score for the classification are all ∼94.7%. All\nthe results described are for the probability threshold of classification being 0.5, i.e.\nwe consider a galaxy as a target if its 𝑃(𝑧≤0.2) ≥0.5. The completeness (purity)\nof our target assignment can be improved by lowering (enlarging) the classification\nprobability threshold.\nFig. 1(b) shows the 𝑔−𝑟color vs. spectroscopic redshift of the test set galaxies\ncolor-coded by the classification probabilities assigned by the XGB classifier. The\nmisclassified galaxies are light orange to the left of the 𝑧= 0.2 vertical line, and\nbrown to the right of this threshold. Most of the 5.3% missed out (false negative)\ngalaxies are lying close to the redshift limit.\nWe applied the XGB model trained on the full spectroscopic catalog from Sec. 2.2\nto the photometric catalog of Sec. 2.1 which is our inference/target set. About 2.9\nmillion galaxies from ∼14 million total sources in the photometric catalog are\nassigned as Class ‘0’ (the target galaxies) and have probabilities, 𝑃(𝑧≤0.2) ≥0.5.\nThis number can be lowered if we increase the probability threshold.\n\n\nTarget Selection for WAVES wide\n5\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Polish National Science Center through grants num-\nber 2020/38/E/ST9/00395 (GK & MB) and 2020/39/B/ST9/03494 (MB & WAH).\nReferences\n1. de Jong, R.
