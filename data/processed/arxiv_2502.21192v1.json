Sin-\ngular SPDEs are characterized by the presence of undeﬁned products as\nsoon as one tries to solve them using regular methods. Indeed, the space-\ntime white noise ξ which appears in many SPDEs has the regularity of a\ndistribution, and we expect solutions to a lot of stochastic PDEs to also\nhave the regularity of a distribution: all non-linerarities in the equation are\nhence undeﬁned, and consequently the equation itself. A classical example\nof singular SPDE is the (Φ4\n3) model which is written\n∂tϕ = ∆ϕ −ϕ3 + ξ\nwhere we have formally ϕ : (t, x) ∈[0, T]×T3 7−→ϕ(t, x) ∈R, the undeﬁned\nterm in the equation being ϕ3.\nTo solve this conceptual diﬃculty, Hairer opts for a very local study of sub-\ncritical SPDEs. Generalizing Taylor series to non-continuous functions by\nadding to monomials new symbols depicting singular stochastic distribu-\ntions, he ﬁrst computes what the generalized Taylor expansion of a solution\nwould look like at each point.\nInterpreting then this generalized Taylor\nexpansion in each point as a function taking values in an algebraic space\nnamed regularity structure, he proves that this function solves an abstract\nﬁxed point problem, which admits a unique solution. Finally, he builds a\nreconstruction operator which maps an abstract function to a space-time\ndistribution, whose generalized Taylor expansion at each point is given by\nthe abstract function. We can then verify that this new distribution solves\nthe SPDE in a particular sense, meaning after we add to the equation new\ndiverging terms named ”renormalization terms”.\nWhile Hairer’s method is extremely powerful for existence and uniqueness\nresults, it is an abstract method which is extremely general, making it less\nuseful when one is studying quantitative properties of the solutions. In paral-\nlel with Hairer’s work, Kupiainen developed a method to study SPDEs based\non Wilsonian renormalization group analysis [3], while Gubinelli, Imkeller\nand Perkowski put forward the theory of paracontrolled distributions in [4],\nwhich was used in [5] to get local-in-time well-posedness results for a speciﬁc\nSPDE. The three methods presented have the same notion of solutions, but\nfor the problem we study, the theory of paracontrolled distributions is the\nhandiest one. Indeed for the (Φ4\n3) model, it gives an almost explicit expres-\nsion of the solutions, and since we are interested in concentration around an\nequilibrium results, we prefer this to abstract writings of solutions.\n2\n\n\nOur work is at the crossroads of two series of papers. In [6, 7], the authors\nstudy concentration results around an equilibrium for non-autonomous gen-\neralizations of the (Φ4\nd) problem in dimension d = 1 and d = 2, and describe\nsome bifurcation phenomena between equilibrium branches. In these dimen-\nsions, the equation is not singular (d = 1) or the solution is a distribution\nbut it is ”almost” a continuous function (d = 2), and therefore we can guess\nwhat renormalization terms look like without introducing new theories. In\n[8, 9], the authors study the (Φ4\n3) model, with a particularly useful diagram-\nbased formalism. More precisely, in [8], Mourrat and Weber get an a priori\nbound for the (Φ4\n3) model on the torus which is independent of the initial\ncondition while rewriting the paracontrolled calculus associated with solving\n(Φ4\n3) in the new formalism. In [9], in collaboration with Xu, they compute\nexplicit bounds on the moments of the H¨older norm of the standard stochas-\ntic integrals that are needed to study (Φ4\n3), stochastic integrals we will call\nsymbols from now on.\nIn this article, we are interested in getting concentration results around a de-\nterministic equilibrium for the solution of a non-autonomous generalization\nof (Φ4\nd) in dimension d = 3. To our knowledge, this problem has not been\nstudied yet, the theory of singular SPDEs being a still young and mainly\nqualitative theory, especially when one considers non-autonomous equations.\nThe main result of this article is that for φ a solution to a non-autonomous\ngeneralized (Φ4\n3) equation where the white noise ξ is multiplied against a\nconstant σ ≪1, denoting φ an attractive solution to the associated deter-\nministic PDE with the same initial condition as φ, we have for any ε > 0\nthat supt∈[0,T] ∥φ(t) −φ(t)∥C−1\n2 −ε is close to 0 with a high probability. We\nemphasize that the existence of an attractive deterministic solution is not\nguaranteed, and that the regime σ ≈1 also deserves to be considered, but\nwe highlight that concentration results around stable equilibrium are the\nﬁrst step towards the study of scenarii involving bifurcations.\nIn order to prove the main concentration results, we will combine several\ntechnical tools found in our diﬀerent references. Here are some insights on\nthe mathematical ideas behind our work.\n• First, we underscore that the theory of paracontrolled distributions is\nformulated in the framework of Besov spaces, and that we will identify\nthe H¨older space Cα with the Besov space Bα\n∞,∞(see Appendix). While\nthis deﬁnition of the H¨older spaces seems complicated at ﬁrst glance\nsince we decompose a function f into an inﬁnite sum of ”blocks” δkf,\nit is particularly relevant when f is a random function we want to\nget concentration results on. Indeed, to control the tail of a random\nvariable one can control its moments, and Proposition A.4 proves that\nwe can bound the p-th moment of ∥f∥Cα with bounds on the p-th\n3\n\n\nmoments of the ∥δkf∥Lp. The blocks being always smooth while f is\noften only a distribution, computations are simpler with blocks than\nwith f.\n• Second, all the symbols that we use in this article can be expressed with\nstochastic integrals only involving independent copies of the stochas-\ntic white noise ξ. This allows us to use the theory of Wiener chaos\nand especially Nelson’s inequality (Proposition A.11) to control the\np-th moment of key random variables with bounds on their second\nmoments. These kinds of bounds are precisely the ones proven in [9].\n• Third, a key idea behind the resolution of (Φ4\n3) using paracontrolled\ndistributions is to to regularize previously undeﬁned products by trading-\noﬀtemporal regularity for spatial regularity in some equations. There-\nfore, random temporal H¨older constants appear naturally in our com-\nputations, and to get concentration results of solutions of (Φ4\n3) we ﬁrst\nneed concentration results on some random temporal H¨older constants.\nBesides, concentration results on supt∈[0,T] ∥f(t)∥for f a symbol are\ndirectly implied by concentration results on the temporal H¨older con-\nstant of f (since we know the initial condition), making the last ones\neven more useful in our context. Computing the moments of a H¨older\nconstant is however a non-trivial task, and we cannot directly use the\nresults found of [9] to do this. To overcome this diﬃculty, we invoke\nthe Garsia-Rodemich-Rumsey inequality proved in [10] to bound the\nsupremum in the deﬁnition of the H¨older constant with an integral\ninvolving terms we can control. This technical trick reveals itself to\nbe extremely powerful when combined with the other tools presented\nabove, and is the main original idea of this article.\n• Fourth, we adapt the formalism of [8] to the non-autonomous context\nin order to write the solution of non-autonomous (Φ4\n3) as the sum of\na singular part made of symbols and a regular one solution to an ex-\nplicit equation. We can then combine technical Lemmas found in the\nAppendix of [8] with the method developed in [7] to transform concen-\ntration results on symbols into concentration results on the solution of\nan equation involving these symbols. We underscore that the results\nwe eventually get are stronger than the strong deviations ones found\nfor instance in [2], since the concentration results we will get on the\nregular part is for H¨older norms of strictly positive exponents.\nThe work is divided as follows for the main parts of the article: in the second\nsection, we introduce the main notations, and state the main concentration\ntheorems, while in the third section we prove them. With regards to the\nappendix, it recalls deﬁnitions and important results in the theory of Besov\nspaces, paracontrolled calculus and Wiener chaos.\n4\n\n\n2\nSetting and main results\n2.1\nNotations\n• Hk for k ≥0: the k-th homogeneous Wiener chaos.\n• H≤k := Lk\nj=0 Hk for k ≥0: the k-th inhomogeneous Wiener chaos.\n• Πk for k ≥0: the projection on Hk.\n• (et∆)t≥0: the heat semigroup.\n• (Cα, ∥· ∥Cα) := (Cα(T3), ∥· ∥Cα) for α ∈R: the space of functions on\nthe 3-dimensional torus which are α-H¨older (see Appendix A.1 for a\ndeﬁnition of H¨older spaces of negative exponents).\n• (Cα\ns , ∥· ∥Cα) for α ∈R: the space of functions on R × T3 which are\nα-H¨older is space and α\n2 -H¨older in time.\n• |τ| for a processus (τ(t))t≥0: the greatest α ∈R such that τ(t) ∈Cβ\nfor all β < α.\n• ξ: the space-time white noise.\n• (f, g) :=\nR\nT3 f(x)g(x)dx for f, g ∈L2(T3).\n•\n= : (f, g) ∈Cα × Cβ 7→f\n= g ∈Cγ for speciﬁc triples (α, β, γ): the\nresonant product (see Appendix A.2 for a precise deﬁnition).\n•\n< : (f, g) ∈Cα × Cβ 7→f\n< g ∈Cγ for speciﬁc triples (α, β, γ) : the\nparaproduct.\n•\n> : (f, g) ∈Cα × Cβ 7→f\n> g = g\n< f ∈Cγ for speciﬁc triples (α, β, γ):\nthe paraproduct with inverted arguments.\n• [ <, =] : (f, g, h) ∈Cα ×Cβ ×Cγ 7−→(f\n< g) = h−f(g = h) ∈Cδ for speciﬁc\nquadruples (α, β, γ, δ): the commutator between\n< and\n=.\n• [et∆, <] : (f, g) ∈Cα × Cβ 7−→et∆(f\n< g) −f\n< (et∆g) ∈Cγ for speciﬁc\ntriples (α, β, γ): the commutator between et∆and\n<.\n2.2\nSetting and main theorems\nWe are considering the following general equation in dimension 3:\n\u001a\n∂tϕ = ∆ϕ + F(t, ϕ) + σξ\nϕ(0) = ϕ0\n(1)\nwhere F is a third degree polynomial with non-constant coeﬃcients\nF(t, ϕ) = a3(t)ϕ3 + a2(t)ϕ2 + a1(t)ϕ + a0(t).\n5\n\n\nHere we will assume that a0, a1, a2, a3 : [0, T] →R are diﬀerentiable (and\ntherefore continuous) and that a3 < 0 (and therefore bounded away from 0).\nSince we are interested in concentration results around an equilibrium for\npotentially large times T, we will make the dependance in T of all constants\nexplicit.\nRemark 2.1. The degree of F has to be odd for the solution of the associated\nPDE not to explode, and the equation is no longer subcritical if the degree\nis greater or equal to ﬁve. Since there is no known theory to solve non-\nsubcritical SPDE, our setting is the most general we can expect.\nSince the computations needed to get the results we want are sometimes\nlong, we want to simplify right now our expressions. For instance, we can\nreplace the term a3 by −1. Indeed, writing ϕ = b(t)ψ, we get\nb(t)∂tψ = b(t)∆ψ + a3(t)b(t)3ψ3 + a2(t)b(t)2ψ2 + (a1(t)b(t) −b′(t))ψ + a0(t) + σξ\nso, taking b =\n1\n√−a3 which is diﬀerentiable, and dividing the equation by\nb(t) we get\n∂tψ = ∆ψ −ψ3 + b2(t)ψ2 + b1(t)ψ + b0(t) + σξb\nwhere b2(t) = a2(t)b(t), b1(t) = a1(t)b(t)−b′(t)\nb(t)\n, b0 = a0\nb and ξb = 1\nbξ. This\nnew gaussian white noise is not homogenous in time, but since b is positive,\nbounded away from 0 and continuous on [0, T], ξb has essentially the same\nproperties as ξ. For instance, for ϕ1, ϕ2 ∈L2(R × T3) of support included in\n[0, T] × T3, we have\nE((ϕ1, ξb)(ϕ2, ξb)) =\nZ\n[0,T]×T3\n1\nb(t)2 ϕ1(t, x)ϕ2(t, x)dtdx.\nWe will therefore drop the b-notation in ξb to simplify writing. We will now\nget rid of the constant term and take an initial condition equal to 0. Indeed,\nfor φ = ψ −φ where φ is a (deterministic) solution of\n(\n∂tφ = ∆φ + F(t, φ)\nφ(0) =\n1\nb(0)ϕ0\nwe have that\n∂tφ = ∆φ + (F(t, φ + φ) −F(t, φ)) + σξ\ntherefore, since φ ∈R 7→F(t, φ + φ) −F(t, φ) is a polynomial in φ equal to\n0 in φ = 0, we get that\n\u001a\n∂tφ = ∆φ + ˜F(t, φ) + σξ\nφ(0) = 0\n(2)\nwith ˜F(t, φ) = −φ3+f2(t)φ2+f1(t)φ. We now take σ > 0 and write a := f1.\n6\n\n\nAssumption. From now on we assume that a < 0, since it is the most\nrelevant case (see Section 2.3).\nRemark 2.2. The hypothesis a < 0 is not necessary to get the concentration\nresults we will prove in this article, but it has a massive impact on the T-\ndependence of the constants in it. Indeed, if we assume that a may take\npositive values, we will have to bound terms like exp(\nR t\ns a(u)du) by exp(T ×\nsup a), and therefore all constants appearing in our concentration results will\nexponentially depend of T, making them far less relevant for large times T.\nThe solutions of stochastic PDEs are often only random distributions and\ninstead of studying them directly, we write them as the sum of a regular part\nand of some speciﬁc random distributions that we represent with symbols.\nAll the symbols we will need in our computations can be built from\nn\nsolution of\n\u001a\n∂\nn = ∆\nn + a(t) n + σξn\nn(0) = 0\n,\nwhere ξn is a regularized white noise such that ξn is smooth and ξn ⇀ξ.\nHere\nn is a smooth space-time function, but taking the limit n →∞we get\n= lim\nn an irregular space-time distribution. We will now construct the\nother symbols, but in order to do that we need ﬁrst to introduce elements\nof paracontrolled calculus. The main tool of paracontrolled calculus is the\ndecomposition of the standard product into three bilinear operators. More\nprecisely, for two functions f, g satisfying certain regularity hypotheses we\nhave\nfg = f\n< g + f\n= g + f\n> g\nwith\n< and\n> the paraproducts, and\n= the resonant product, that are all\nexpressed using the decomposition of functions in H¨older spaces into inﬁ-\nnite sums of Paley-Littlewood blocks. The technical details are left for the\nAppendix, but we want to underscore that\n=, < and\n> are relevant for our\nstudy because they interact particularly well with one another, so we can\nuse technical results such as Proposition A.7 to give meaning to products\nthat are supposed to be undeﬁned.\nNow that we have a deﬁnition for\nand that we introduced the resonant\nproduct, we can build all the symbols we need. They all belong to T =\n{ ,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n} where we have following [9]:\n(t) := limn→+∞\nn\n(t) := limn→∞\nn(t) = limn→+∞\nn(t)2 −cn(t)\n(t) := limn→∞I( 2\nn −cn)(t)\n(t) := limn→+∞\nn = limn→+∞I( 3\nn −3cn )(t)\n7\n\n\n(t) := limn→+∞\nn(t)\n=\nn(t)\n(t) := limn→+∞\nn(t) = limn→∞I(\nn)(t)\n=\nn(t) −2c′\nn(t)\n(t) := limn→∞\nn(t)\n=\nn(t) −6c′\nn(t) n\nwith cn(t) := E( n(t)2) ∝σ2 and c′\nn(t) := E(I(\nn)(t)\n=\nn(t)) ∝σ4, and\nwhere we have for α(t, u) =\nR t\nu a(s)ds\nI(f)(t) =\nZ t\n0\neα(t,u)e(t−u)∆f(u)du,\nthe solution to (∂t −∆−a(t))g = f(t) with initial condition g(0) = 0.\nRemark 2.3. We will sometimes need in our computations\nn =\n3\nn−3cn,\nbut we don’t put its limit in T because it is very irregular in time and we\ncannot therefore give meaning to ”\n(t)” for t ∈[0, T].\nFinally, we introduce for all these objects their chaos decomposition (CD).\nThe precise deﬁnitions are left for the Appendix, but in few words we can\nwrite all our symbols as ﬁnite sums of space-time distributions called Wiener\nchaos, that are homogeneous in σ. The largest k ∈N such that τ ∈T\nadmits a component in the Wiener chaos of order k is denoted nτ and always\ncorresponds to the number of leaves of τ. We have the following table, with\nall information inside found in [9]:\nτ(t)\n(t)\n(t)\n(t)\n(t)\n(t)\n(t)\n(t)\n|τ|\n−1/2\n−1\n1\n1/2\n0\n0\n−1/2\nCD\nH1\nH2\nH2\nH3\nH2\nL H4\nH2\nL H4\nH1\nL H3\nL H5\nnτ\n1\n2\n2\n3\n4\n4\n5\nRemark 2.4. If we consider a space-time setting as in [2], we can only\nexpect\nto be in C\n−1\n2 −ε\ns\n(T3 × R), so its time regularity is C−1\n4 −ε\n2 and the\nnotation ” (t)” is a priori meaningless. It is thanks to the computations\nmade in [9] that we know that ” (t)” has a meaning as an element of C−1\n2−ε.\nNow that we have all the deﬁnitions needed, we will state our ﬁrst concen-\ntration result on the spatial norm of the symbols of T .\nTheorem 2.5. For all τ ∈T , λ ∈(0, 1) and α < |τ| −λ, there exists\ncτ := cτ(λ), dτ := dτ(λ) > 0 independent of T such that for k ≤nτ and\nh > 0\nP\n \nsup\nt∈[0,T]\n∥Πkτ(t)∥Cα > hk\n!\n≤dτ exp\n\u0012\n−cτ\nT\nλ\nk\nh2\nσ2\n\u0013\n.\n8\n\n\nRemark 2.6. We need to put Πk in the formula because the scaling in\nσ is not the same for the diﬀerent components of τ in the Wiener chaos\ndecomposition. If we ﬁx σ and only consider a variable h, a similar inequality\nwould hold without the Πk. Since in this article we are interested in the case\nσ ≪h, we prefer to use this formulation.\nRemark 2.7. While cτ and dτ do not depend of T, they do depend of\na+ = −sup a and a−= −inf a.\nNow that we have introduced the symbols of T and established that we\nhave a strong control on their norms, we can go back to our main equation.\nA key remark of singular SPDE theory, is that there is no solution to our\nequation in the classical sense. Indeed, knowing that the space regularity\nof ξ is C−5\n2 −ε, Schauder’s theory gives us that the expected space regularity\nof the solution to (2) is C−1\n2−ε making all the non-linear terms undeﬁned.\nThis underscores the limits of the standard formalism when describing phe-\nnomena associated with stochastic PDEs, and we now have to introduce the\nprocedure called renormalization.\nInstead of saying that φ is the solution of (2), we say that φ = limn→+∞φn\nwhere φn is the unique smooth solution of a ”renormalized equation” where\nadditional (diverging with n) terms are added, here highlighted in red:\n\u001a\n∂tφn = ∆φn −(φ3\nn−3cn(t)φ) + f2(t)(φ2\nn−cn(t)) + a(t)φn + σξn\nφn(0) = 0\n(3)\nThen, considering θn = φn −\nn, we have\n∂tθn = ∆θn −[(θn +\nn)3 −3cn(t)(θn +\nn)] + f2(t)[(θ +\nn)2 −cn(t)] + a(t)θ\n= ∆θn −θ3\nn −3 nθ2\nn −3( 2\nn −cn(t))θn −( 3\nn −3cn(t) n)\n+ f2(t)θ2\nn + 2f2(t)θn\nn + f2(t)(\n2\nn −cn(t)) + a(t)θn\n= ∆θn −θ3\nn −3 nθ2\nn −3\nnθn −\nn\n+ f2(t)θ2\nn + 2f2(t)θn\nn + f2(t)\nn + a(t)θn.\nContrary to (3), all the terms in this equation admit a limit when n goes to\ninﬁnity, so for θ := limn→+∞θn, we have\n(∂t −∆−a(t))θ = −θ3 −3 θ2 −3\nθ −\n+ f2(t)θ2 + 2f2(t)θ\n+ f2(t)\nWe here face a new diﬃculty, since the term\nis in C\n−3\n2−ε\ns\n, so Schauder’s\ntheory predicts that the solution of this equation would be at most of space\nregularity C\n1\n2−ε, making the product\nθ undeﬁned. We therefore use a\nsimilar method as before by adding a second renormalization constant c′\nn(t)\nin the equation of θn and looking at the equation solved by un = θn +\nn\nbefore taking the limit (we here use that (∂t −∆−a(t))\n=\nto make\nthe irregular term\ndisappear).\n9\n\n\nRemark 2.8. We added a ﬁrst renormalization term when we tried to deﬁne\nθ and a second one we tried to deﬁne u. If we go back to the equation of φn,\nthe ﬁrst term is equal to +3cn(t)φn −f2(t)cn(t), while we will see that the\nsecond one is equal to\n−6c′\nn(t)(3\nn + 3θn) = −6c′\nn(3\nn + 3(φn −\nn)) = −18c′\nn(t)φn.\nEventually the renormalized equation solved by φn is\n\u001a\n∂tφn = ∆φn −φ3\nn + f2(t)φ2\nn + a(t)φn+(3cn(t) −18c′\nn(t))φn −f2(t)cn(t) + σξ\nφ(0) = 0\n(4)\nwhere we can show that cn(t) ≍n and c′\nn(t) ≍ln(n).\nThe technical details are left to Section 3.3.1, but we can show that space\nregularity of u := lim un should be C1−ε. This is still not enough to give\nmeaning to all terms in the equation solved by u, since there are in it prod-\nucts of the form\nu, and the space regularity of\nis only C−1−ε. To solve\nthis last diﬃculty, we need to decompose some products into their para-\nproducts and resonant product components, and following exactly the same\nmethod as in [8], we ﬁnd that we can write u = v + w + 3I(\n) with (u, w)\nsolution of\n\u001a (∂t −∆−a(t))v\n=\nF(v + w),\n(∂t −∆−a(t))w\n=\nG(v, w),\n(5)\nfor F and G speciﬁc functions. Technical details are again left to Section\n3.3.1, but we stress right now that all terms in (5) are well-deﬁned and that,\ncontrary to the other equations above, (5) is well-posed.\nRemark 2.9. The term +3I(\n) in the decomposition of u is not usually\nmet when dealing with (Φ4\n3) and cannot be found in [8]. We subtracted it\nfrom the w of [8] because it has a component in the Wiener chaos of order\n1, which creates technical diﬃculties with regards to the σ-homogeneity in\nsome proofs (see Remark 3.8).\nNow that we have rigorously deﬁned functions v and w, we can state the\nmain result of this article.\nTheorem 2.10. For ε > 0 and λ ∈(0, ε\n3 ∧1), there exists h0 > 0, and\nC := C(λ), D := D(λ) > 0 independent of T such that for all h ∈(0, h0) we\nhave\nP\n \nsup\nt∈[0,T]\nmax(∥v(t)∥C1−2ε, ∥w(t)∥C\n3\n2 −2ε) ≥h\n!\n≤D exp\n\u0012\n−\nC\n(1 + T)λ\nh2\nσ2\n\u0013\n.\nHere we recall that for ϕ solution of the renormalized version of (1) (see\nRemark 2.8), we have ϕ = b(t)\nh\nφ +\n−\n+ 3I(\n) + (v + w)\ni\n.\nRemark 2.11.

We will look for stable, constant in\nspace solutions to (7), that is to say applications φ : [0, T] →R such that\n\u001a ∂tφ(t) = −φ(t)3 + γ(t)φ(t)\nγ(t) −3φ(t)2 < 0\nfor all t ∈[0, T]\n(8)\nthe second condition being a rewriting of a := f1 < 0.\nThere are two\nnoteworthy particular cases:\n• If γ(t) < 0 for all t ∈[0, T], the condition γ(t) −3φ(t)2 < 0 is always\nveriﬁed. Therefore, for any constant in space initial condition, we have\nthat φ is a stable solution.\n• If γ(t) > 0 for all t ∈[0, T] and γ is decreasing, we can check that\nφ+(t) =\np\nγ(t)/3 is a strict subsolution to (7) and φ−(t) = −\np\nγ(t)/3\nis a strict supersolution.\nTherefore, if φ(0) > φ+(0) (respectively\nφ(0) < φ−(0)), we have that φ(t) > φ+(t) for all t ∈[0, T] (respectively\nφ(t) < φ−(t) for all t ∈[0, T]), which means that γ(t) −3φ(t)2 < 0.\nEventually, for any constant in space initial condition taken outside of\n[−\np\nγ(0)/3,\np\nγ(0)/3], we have that φ is a stable solution.\nFor such such a stable, constant in space solution φ and for σ ≪1, Theorem\n2.10 gives us that v + w is close to 0 for t ∈[0, T] and likewise, Theorem 2.5\ngives us that\n,\nand I(\n) are close to 0 for t ∈[0, T]. Eventually we\nhave that ϕ −φ =\n−\n+ 3I(\n) + (v + w) is close to 0 for t ∈[0, T].\nRemark 2.12. Since I(\n) is not in T we cannot directly use Theorem 1\non it, but since we proved that ∥\n∥C−1\n2 −ε has a gaussian tail, Schauder’s\nestimate implies that ∥I(\n)∥C\n3\n2 −2ε also has a gaussian tail.\n11\n\n\n3\nProof of the main theorems\n3.1\nA note on bounds from [9]\nWe must ﬁrst notice that we cannot directly use the inequalities proven in\n[9] since we are not exactly in the same setting. Indeed, in [9] the authors\nconsider formally for Pt−s = e−(t−s)e(t−s)∆\n˜(t) =\nZ t\n−∞\nPt−s(ξ(s))ds,\nthat is an ”ancient solution” to the homogeneous in time stochastic heat\nequation. Here, we consider for P(t, s) = e\nR t\ns a(u)due(t−s)∆\n(t) =\nZ t\n0\nP(t, s)(ξ(s))ds,\nthat is a solution to the non-autonomous heat equation equal to 0 in 0. We\ncan however prove that bounds of the type [9, (3.13)&(3.15)] are still valid\nin our setting, and that constants in them are independent of T. It would\nbe tedious to prove this for all seven symbols, so we will prove it for\n. The\nreader can convince themself that those bounds work for all other symbols.\nWe have for t ∈[0, T] and ω ∈Z3\nˆ(t, ω) =\nZ t\n0\nˆP(t, s)dW(s, ω)\n=\nZ t\n0\neα(t,s)e−(t−s)4π2|ω|2dW(s, ω)\nThen, writing a+ = −sup[0,T] a > 0, we have that a + a+ ≤0 and therefore\nE[|ˆ(t, ω)|2] =\nZ t\n0\nˆP(t, s)2ds\n=\nZ t\n0\ne2\nR t\ns [a(u)+a+]due−2(t−s)(a++4π2|ω|2)ds\n≤\nZ t\n0\ne−2(t−s)(a++4π2|ω|2)ds\n≤\n1\n2(a+ + 4π2|ω|2)\nThis is exactly the estimate [9, (3.15)] we want and it only depends of the\nvalues that a takes, being therefore independent of T. If we now look at\n12\n\n\ntemporal diﬀerences we have for 0 ≤s ≤t ≤T\nE[|ˆ(t, ω) −ˆ(s, ω)|2] ≤\nZ s\n0\n| ˆP(t, u) −ˆP(s, u)|2du\n≤\nZ s\n0\n|eα(t,u)e−(t−u)4π2|ω|2 −eα(s,u)e−(s−u)4π2|ω|2|2du\n≤2\nZ s\n0\n|eα(s,u)e−(t−u)4π2|ω|2 −eα(s,u)e−(s−u)4π2|ω|2|2du\n+ 2\nZ s\n0\n|(eα(t,s) −1)eα(s,u)e−(t−u)(4π2|ω|2)|2du\n≤2\nZ s\n0\n|e−(t−u)(a++4π2|ω|2) −e−(s−u)(a++4π2|ω|2)|2du\n+ 2\nZ s\n0\n|(eα(t,s) −1)e−(t−u)(a++4π2|ω|2)|2du\n≤2|e−(t−s)(a++4π2|ω|2) −1|2\nZ s\n0\ne−2(s−u)(a++4π2|ω|2)du\n+ 2|eα(t,s) −1|2\nZ s\n0\ne−2(t−u)(a++4π2|ω|2)du\nWe then use the standard inequalities |1 −e−x| ≤1 ∧x ≤1 ∧x\nλ\n2 for x ≥0\nand λ ∈(0, 1). Denoting a−= −inf a we have\nE[|ˆ(t, ω) −ˆ(s, ω)|2] ≤2(1 ∧(t −s)λ(a+ + 4π2|ω|2)λ)\nZ s\n0\ne−2(s−u)(a++4π2|ω|2)du\n+ 2(1 ∧(a−)λ(t −s)λ)\nZ s\n0\ne−2(t−u)(a++4π2|ω|2)du\n≤2(t −s)λ((a+ + 4π2|ω|2)λ + (a−)λ)\n1\n2(a+ + 4π2|ω|2)\n≤C1(t −s)λ⟨ω⟩−2+2λ\nwhere ⟨ω⟩=\np\n1 + |ω|2 and C1 := C(a+, a−) is independent of λ since we\ncan bound terms like (a−)λ by (1 + a−). This is exactly the estimate [9,\n(3.17)] for\n. In fact, it is better than [9, (3.17)], since in [9] they ask for\n|t −s| to be less than 1, while we have an inequality that does not depend\nof T and is uniform in 0 ≤s ≤t ≤T.\n3.2\nProof of Theorem 2.5\nWe ﬁrst underscore that the constant in front of ξ in the deﬁnition of\nis\nnot 1 but σ, so all occurrences of ξ in equations are replaced by ξσ = σξ\nand the iterated stochastic integrals are against an element of the form\nξσ(dz1) · · · ξσ(dzk) = σkξ(dz1) · · · ξ(dzk). Therefore, writing\nτ =\nnτ\nX\nℓ=0\nTℓ,\n13\n\n\nwith Tℓa process in Hℓ, we have Tℓ= σℓ˜Tℓwith ˜Tℓindependent of σ.\nWe write the computations that follow with τ in order not to overload the\npresentation, but they trivially work for all ˜Tℓ.\nProposition 3.1. Let τ ∈T , and β < |τ| −λ for λ ∈(0, 1). Then there\nexist ℓτ := ℓτ(λ) and mτ := mτ(λ) independent of T such that for γ0 :=\nγ0(T, λ) ∈(λ\n4 , λ\n2), k ≤nτ and all γ ∈(γ0, λ\n2) we have\nP\n\u0010\n[Πkτ]β,γ > hk\u0011\n≤mτ exp\n\u0012\n−ℓτ\nh2\nσ2\n\u0013\n,\nwhere [f]β,γ = sup0≤s<t≤T\n∥f(t)−f(s)∥Cβ\n|t−s|γ\nThe proof relies heavily on the Garsia-Rodemich-Rumsey Lemma (see [10,\nLemma 1.1]).\nLemma 3.2.

In other words, we have that (τ(t), φ) ∈H≤nτ for all smooth\nfunctions φ on T3 and t ∈R, with furthermore an expectation equal to 0.\nSince δkτ(t) is a continuous function for all k ≥−1 and t ∈[0, T], we have\neventually that δkτ(t, x) ∈H≤nτ for all (t, x) ∈[0, T]×T3. Hence, using ﬁrst\nFubini’s theorem and then Nelson’s estimate (Proposition A.11), we have\nE[∥δkτ(t) −δkτ(s)∥p\nLp] ≤sup\nz∈T3 E[|δkτ(t, z) −δkτ(s, z)|p]\n≤sup\nz∈T3 Cp\nnτ(p −1)\nnτ p\n2 \u0000E[|δkτ(t, z) −δkτ(s, z)|2]\n\u0001 p\n2 .\nThen, we use the estimates proven in [9] and the proof of [9, Proposition\n3.6] to get that for α = |τ| −λ and all (t, z) ∈[0, T] × T3\nE[|δkτ(t, z) −δkτ(s, z)|2] ≤C1|t −s|λ2−2kα,\n(10)\nso eventually\nE[∥δkτ(t) −δkτ(s)∥p\nLp] ≤|t −s|\nλp\n2 Cp\nnτC\np\n2\n1 (p −1)\nnτ p\n2 2−kpα.\n15\n\n\nSince β < α, Proposition A.4 gives us that, for p >\n3\nα−β + 1,\nE[∥τ(t) −τ(s)∥p\nCβ] ≤Cp\n0 sup\nk≥−1\n2kpα|t −s|\nλp\n2 Cp\nnτ C\np\n2\n1 (p −1)\nnτ p\n2 2−kpα\n≤|t −s|\nλp\n2 Cp\n0Cp\nnτ C\np\n2\n1 (p −1)\nnτ p\n2 .\n(11)\nRemark 3.3.

Using Schauder’s estimate (Proposition\n19\n\n\nA.5), the inequality sup a = −a+ < 0 and the fact that α 7→∥· ∥Cα is\nnon-decreasing, we directly get that\n∥v(t)∥C1−2ε = ∥\nZ t\n0\neα(t,u)e(t−u)∆F(v + w)(u)du∥C1−2ε\n≤\nZ t\n0\neα(t,u)∥e(t−u)∆F(v + w)(u)∥C1−2εdu\n≤\nZ t\n0\ne−a+(t−u)C (t −u)\n−1−ε−(1−2ε)\n2\n∥F(v + w)(u)∥C−1−εdu\n≤\nZ t\n0\ne−a+(t−u)C (t −u)\n−1−ε−(1−2ε)\n2\n∥F(v + w)(u)∥C1−εdu\n≤C sup\ns∈[0,t]\n∥F(v + w)(s)∥C−1−ε\nZ t\n0\ne−a+uu−1+ ε\n2 du\n≤C sup\ns∈[0,t]\n∥F(v + w)(s)∥C−1−ε\nsince u 7→e−a+uu−1+ ε\n2 is integrable, and we have therefore C independent\nof T. We have then using Proposition A.6 that\n∥F(v + w)∥C−1−ε ≤3∥(v + w −\n)\n<\n∥C−1−ε + ∥f2∥∞∥\n∥C−1−ε\n≤C∥v + w −\n∥C\n1\n2 −ε × ∥\n∥C−1−ε + ∥f2∥∞∥\n∥C−1−ε\n≤C(∥v∥C1−2ε + ∥w∥C\n3\n2 −2ε + ∥\n∥C\n1\n2 −ε + ∥f2∥∞)∥\n∥C−1−ε.\nLikewise, we have\n∥w(t)∥C\n3\n2 −2ε ≤C sup\ns∈[0,t]\n∥G(v, w)(s)∥C−1\n2 −ε.\nSince the expression of G is more complex than the one of F, we will study\nits ﬁve terms one after the other. For the cubic term (v + w)3 we have\n∥−(v + w)3∥C−1\n2 −ε ≤∥(v + w)3∥C1−2ε\n≤C∥v + w∥3\nC1−2ε\n≤C(∥v∥3\nC1−2ε + ∥w∥3\nC\n3\n2 −2ε).\nIf we consider the resonant product of\nand w we have, thanks to Propo-\nsition, A.6\n∥3w\n=\n∥C−1\n2 −ε ≤∥3w\n=\n∥C\n1\n2 −3ε\n≤C∥w∥C\n3\n2 −2ε∥\n∥C−1−ε.\nFor the fourth term we have likewise\n∥3(v + w −\n)\n>\n∥C−1\n2 −ε ≤C∥v + w −\n∥C\n1\n2 −ε\n2 ∥\n∥C−1−ε\n2\n≤C(∥\n∥C\n1\n2 −ε\n2 + ∥v∥C1−2ε + ∥w∥C\n3\n2 −2ε)∥\n∥C−1−ε\n2 .\n20\n\n\nWith regards to the polynomial P we have\n∥P(v + w)∥C−1\n2 −ε ≤C\nh\n∥d0∥C−1\n2 −ε + ∥d1∥C−1\n2 −ε∥v + w∥C1−2ε\n+∥d2∥C−1\n2 −ε∥(v + w)2∥C1−2ε\ni\n≤C\nh\n∥d0∥C−1\n2 −ε + ∥d1∥C−1\n2 −ε(∥v∥C1−2ε + ∥w∥C\n3\n2 −2ε)\n+∥d2∥C−1\n2 −ε(∥v∥2\nC1−2ε + ∥w∥2\nC\n3\n2 −2ε)\ni\nThe term involving com is more complex. We have on the one hand, thanks\nto Proposition A.7, that\n∥com2(v + w)∥C−1\n2 −ε\n≤∥com2(v + w)∥C\n1\n2 −ε\n≤C(∥v + w −\n∥C\n1\n2 −1\n3 ε∥\n∥C1−1\n3 ε∥\n∥C−1−1\n3 ε)\n≤C\n\u0010\n∥v∥C1−2ε + ∥w∥C\n3\n2 −2ε + ∥\n∥C\n1\n2 −1\n3 ε\n\u0011\n∥\n∥C1−1\n3 ε∥\n∥C−1−1\n3 ε\nFor com1 on the other hand, integrating (5) we have that\nv(t) = −3\nZ t\n0\neα(t,s)e(t−s)∆[(v + w −\n)\n<\n](s)ds\nand therefore\ncom1(v, w)(t) = −3\nZ t\n0\neα(t,s)e(t−s)∆[(v + w −\n)\n<\n](s)ds\n+ 3(v + w −\n)(t)\n<\n(t).\nThe computations associated with com1 are the most subtle of this Part, and\nwe recall from [8] that the motivation behind the deﬁnition of com1(v, w) is\nthat we expect it to be a bit more regular than v so that com1(v, w)\n=\nis well deﬁned (while v\n=\nis not). To understand why this is the case,\nwe have to rewrite com1(v, w)(t) = At + Bt where the couple (A, B) ̸=\n\u0010\nv, 3(v + w −\n)\n<\n\u0011\nis to be deﬁned in the next paragraphs.\nWe ﬁ-\nnally emphasize that while the inequalities above were purely spatial and\nuniformly true in t ∈[0, T], we will get for com1 inequalities where t is\nexplicitly present. We ﬁrst rewrite\nv(t) = −3\nZ t\n0\neα(t,s)e(t−s)∆[(v + w −\n)\n<\n](s)ds\n= −3\nZ t\n0\neα(t,s)[e(t−s)∆, <]((v + w −\n),\n)(s)ds\n−3\nZ t\n0\neα(t,s)[(v + w −\n)\n< e(t−s)∆\n](s)ds\n21\n\n\nwhere [e(t−s)∆, <](f, g) = e(t−s)∆(f\n< g) −f\n< (e(t−s)∆g).\nFrom now on,\nwe denote by At the ﬁrst term on the left-hand side. We now recall that\n(t) =\nR t\n0 eα(t,s)e(t−s)∆\n(s)ds, so that, writing δs,tf = f(s)−f(t), we have\n−3\nZ t\n0\n[(v + w −\n)\n< eα(t,s)e(t−s)∆\n](s)ds + 3(v + w −\n)\n<\n(t)\n= −3\nZ t\n0\n[(v + w −\n)\n< eα(t,s)e(t−s)∆\n](s)ds\n+ 3(v + w −\n)(t)\n<\n\u0014Z t\n0\neα(t,s)e(t−s)∆\n(s)ds\n\u0015\n= −3\nZ t\n0\n[[δs,t(v + w −\n)]\n< eα(t,s)e(t−s)∆\n(s)]ds\n=: Bt\nCombining both writings, we check that com1(v, w)(t) = At + Bt. There-\nfore, using Proposition A.9 to bound the norm of At and Proposition A.6\ncombined with Proposition A.5 to bound the one of Bt, we get\n∥com1(v, w)(t)∥C1+2ε\n≤∥At∥C1+2ε + ∥Bt∥C1+2ε\n≤C sup\ns∈[0,t]\n∥(v + w −\n)(s)∥C\n1\n2 −ε∥\n(s)∥−1−ε\n+ C\nZ t\n0\n∥δs,t(v + w −\n)∥L∞∥eα(t,s)e(t−s)∆\n(s)∥C1+2εds\n≤C sup\ns∈[0,t]\n∥(v + w −\n)(s)∥C\n1\n2 −ε∥\n(s)∥C−1−ε\n+ C\nZ t\n0\n∥δs,t(v + w −\n)∥L∞e−a+(t−s)(t −s)\n−1−ε−1−2ε\n2\n∥\n(s)∥C−1−εds\nWe then use the temporal regularity of v, w and\nto argue that\n∥δs,t(v + w −\n)∥L∞≤˜C(t −s)\n1\n8 ,\nso the integral above converges since ε <\n1\n16 and we have\n∥com1(v, w)(t)∥C1+2ε\n≤C( sup\ns∈[0,t]\n[∥v(s)∥C1−2ε + ∥w(s)∥C\n3\n2 −2ε + ∥\n(s)∥C\n1\n2 −ε]∥\n(s)∥C−1−ε\n+ ˜C sup\ns∈[0,t]\n∥\n(s)∥C−1−ε)\nThis quantity being ﬁnite, com1(v, w)(t) belongs to C1+2ε and the product\ncom1(v, w)(t) =\n(t) is therefore well-deﬁned. Besides, Proposition A.6 gives\n22\n\n\nus that\n∥com1(v, w)\n=\n(t)∥Cε\n≤C∥com1(v, w)(t)∥C1+2ε∥\n(t)∥C−1−ε\n≤C\n(\nsup\ns∈[0,t]\nh\n∥v(s)∥C1−2ε + ∥w(s)∥C\n3\n2 −2ε + ∥\n(s)∥C\n1\n4 −ε\ni\n∥\n(s)∥2\nC−1−ε\n+ ˜C sup\ns∈[0,t]\n∥\n(s)∥2\nC−1−ε\n)\n.\n(14)\nCombining all the inequalities above, we get a priori bounds on ∥v∥C1−2ε\nand ∥w∥C\n3\n2 −2ε involving both these two norms and the spatial norms of the\ndiﬀerent symbols of T . Now, we would like to combine Theorem 2.5, that\nproves concentration for all the symbols of T , with these inequalities in order\nto obtain concentration for v and w. However, we stress that (14) introduces\nan additional diﬃculty with the constant ˜C. Indeed, ˜C is not deterministic\nbut random, and to get a Gaussian tail for v and w, we need to prove that\n˜C also has a Gaussian tail. We have for t ≤t0 that\n˜C = [(v + w −\n)|[0,t]]0, 1\n8 ≤[v|[0,t0]]0, 1\n8 + [w|[0,t0]]0, 1\n8 + [\n]0, 1\n8,\nwhere we recall that the deﬁnition of [f]β,γ is in Proposition 3.1. Thanks to\nCorollary 3.5, we already now that [\n]0, 1\n8 has a gaussian tail. For the other\nterms, we will use a trick found in [8] to get inequalities on [v]0, 1\n8 and [w]0, 1\n8\nsimilar to the ones we got on ∥v∥C1−2ε and ∥w∥C\n3\n2 −2ε. We can then prove\nconcentration on all those terms at the same time, and conclude. Using that\nwe can write\nv(t) =\nZ t\n0\neα(t,u)e(t−u)∆F(v + w)(u)du,\nwe have for 0 ≤s < t ≤T that\nv(t) −v(s) =\nZ t\ns\neα(t,u)e(t−u)∆F(v + w)(u)du\n+ (eα(t,s) −1)\nZ s\n0\neα(s,u)e(t−u)∆F(v + w)(u)du\n+ (e(t−s)∆−Id)\nZ s\n0\neα(s,u)e(s−u)∆F(v + w)(u)du\nWe then try to bound the L∞norm of each of these three terms. For the\n23\n\n\nﬁrst one we have\n∥\nZ t\ns\neα(t,u)e(t−u)∆F(v + w)(u)du∥L∞\n≤\nZ t\ns\neα(t,u)∥e(t−u)∆F(v + w)(u)∥L∞du\n≤C\nZ t\ns\ne−a+(t−u)(t −u)−1+ε\n2 ∥F(v + w)(u)∥C−1−εdu\n≤C sup\nu∈[0,t]\n∥F(v + w)(u)∥C−1−ε\nZ t\ns\ne−a+(t−u)(t −u)−1+ε\n2 du\n≤C sup\nu∈[0,t]\n∥F(v + w)(u)∥C−1−ε1 ∧(t −s)1−1+ε\n2\n≤C sup\nu∈[0,t]\n∥F(v + w)(u)∥C−1−ε(t −s)\n1\n8 .\nwhere C is independent of T. We then consider the second term using the\nsame inequalities as in Section 3.1\n∥(eα(t,s) −1)\nZ s\n0\neα(s,u)e(t−u)∆F(v + w)(u)du∥L∞\n≤|eα(t,s) −1|\nZ s\n0\ne−a+(s−u)∥e(t−u)∆F(v + w)(u)∥L∞\n≤C sup\nu∈[0,t]\n∥F(v + w)(u)∥C−1−ε(1 ∧a−(t −s))\nZ s\n0\ne−a+(t−u)(t −u)−1+ε\n2 du\n≤C sup\nu∈[0,t]\n∥F(v + w)(u)∥C−1−ε(1 ∧a−(t −s))\n≤C sup\nu∈[0,t]\n∥F(v + w)(u)∥C−1−ε(t −s)\n1\n8\nFinally, for the third term, we use the second inequality of Proposition A.5\nto control the operator (e(t−s)∆−Id)\n∥(e(t−s)∆−Id)\nZ s\n0\neα(s,u)e(s−u)∆F(v + w)(u)du∥L∞\n≤(t −s)\n1\n4 −0\n2 ∥\nZ s\n0\neα(s,u)e(s−u)∆F(v + w)(u)du∥C\n1\n4\n≤C(t −s)\n1\n8\nZ s\n0\ne−a+(s−u)(s −u)−\n1+ε+ 1\n4\n2\n∥F(v + w)(u)∥C−1−εdu\n≤C(t −s)\n1\n8 sup\nu∈[0,t]\n∥F(v + w)(u)∥C−1−ε\nZ s\n0\ne−a+(s−u)(s −u)−\n1+ε+ 1\n4\n2\n≤C(t −s)\n1\n8 sup\nu∈[0,t]\n∥F(v + w)(u)∥C−1−ε\n24\n\n\nDividing by (t −s)\n1\n8 on both sides of the three inequalities and taking the\nsupremum in 0 ≤s < t ≤t0, we eventually get\n[v|[0,t0]]0, 1\n8 ≤C\nsup\nu∈[0,t0]\n∥F(v + w)(u)∥C−1−ε,\n(15)\nwhere we already have a bound on supu∈[0,t] ∥F(v + w)(u)∥C−1−ε. Likewise,\nfollowing exactly the same strategy, we get\n[w|[0,t0]]0, 1\n8 ≤C\nsup\nu∈[0,t0]\n∥G(v + w)(u)∥C−1\n2 −ε.\n(16)\nThe main idea in what follows is that if we assume that our symbols stay\nclose to 0 on an interval of [0, T], it will imply that v and w also stay close\nto 0 on this interval. Let us indeed take h < 1 (so that hn ≤h2 if n ≥2)\nand a given time t0, and let us assume that\nmax( sup\ns∈[0,t0]\n∥v(s)∥C1−2ε, sup\ns∈[0,t0]\n∥w(s)∥C\n3\n2 −2ε, [v|[0,t0]]0, 1\n8 , [w|[0,t0]]0, 1\n8, [\n]0, 1\n8) ≤h.\n(17)\nand that for all symbols τ ∈T and k ≤nτ\nsup\ns∈[0,t0]\n∥Πkτ(s)∥Cατ ≤hk.\n(18)\nwhere ατ = |τ| −ε\n3. The crucial observation is that under (17) and (18),\ncombining all the inequalities we got above on the components of F and G,\nwe have\nsup\ns∈[0,t0]\n∥F(v+w)(s)∥C−1−ε ≤Ch2\nand\nsup\ns∈[0,t0]\n∥G(v+w)(s)∥C−1\n2 −ε ≤Ch2\nRemark 3.8. The second bound would not hold if we hadn’t removed 3I(\n)\nfrom the deﬁnition of w. Indeed, the term d0 would therefore contain a 3\nwhose component in the ﬁrst Wiener chaos is only bounded by an h (and\nnot h2) in our hypothesis.\nNow, we can ﬁnally end the proof of Theorem 2.10. Let us take h0 ∈(0, 1)\nsuch that Kh2\n0 < h0 for K = C2. Then, considering for h ∈(0, h0)\nκ = inf\n(\nt > 0, max{ sup\ns∈[0,t]\n∥v(s)∥C1−2ε, sup\ns∈[0,t]\n∥w(s)∥C\n3\n2 −2ε,\n[v|[0,t]]0, 1\n8 , [w|[0,t]]0, 1\n8 } > h\no\n∧T\nwe get\n{κ < T} ∩{∀τ ∈T , ∀k ≤nτ, sup\ns≤κ\n∥Πkτ(s)∥Cατ ≤hk} ∩{[\n]0, 1\n8 ≤h} = ∅\n25\n\n\nTherefore, using Theorem 2.5 and Corollary 3.5, we get that\nP(κ < T) ≤P(∃(τ, k) ∈(T , J1, nτK),\nsup\ns∈[0,T]\n∥Πkτ(s)∥Cατ > hk)\n+ P([\n]0, 1\n8 > h)\n≤\nX\nτ∈T\nnτ\nX\nk=1\nP( sup\ns∈[0,T]\n∥Πkτ(s)∥Cατ > hk)\n+ P([\n]0, 1\n8 > h3)\n≤5Card(T )D′ exp(−\nC′\nmax(T\nλ\n5 , T λ)\nh2\nσ2 ) + m′\nexp(−ℓ′\nh2\nσ2 )\nsince T\nλ\nk ≤max(T\nλ\n5 , T λ). Here we may take D′ = supτ∈T dτ(λ) et C′ =\ninfτ∈T cτ(λ). We then take D = 5Card(T )D′ + m′\nand C = min(C′, ℓ′\n)\nand Theorem 2.10 is proven.\n26\n\n\nA\nTechnical tools\nA.1\nDecomposition into Paley-Littlewood blocks\nThere exists ˜χ, χ ∈C∞\nc (Rd) taking values in [0, 1] with\nSupp ˜χ ⊂B(0, 4\n3),\nSupp χ ⊂B(0, 8\n3) \\ B(0, 3\n4)\nand such that\n˜χ(ζ) +\n∞\nX\nk=0\nχ( ζ\n2k ) = 1,\n∀ζ ∈Rd.\nWe furthermore assume that ˜χ and χ are radially symmetric.

For each n ∈N, the closure in L2(Ω, F, P) of the linear span\nof the set\n{ξ(ϕ1) · · · ξ(ϕk), k ≤n, ϕ1, . . . , ϕk ∈L2(R × Td)}\ncoincides with\nH≤n :=\nn\nM\nk=0\nHk.\nLet us now state Nelson’s estimate which is a key inequality when one deals\nwith Wiener chaos.\nProposition A.11. For every n ≥1, there exists a constant Cn < +∞\nsuch that for every X ∈H≤n and p ≥2 we have\nE[|X|p]\n1\np ≤Cn(p −1)\nn\n2 E(X2)\n1\n2\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank my PhD supervisor Nils Berglund, who introduced me\nto the subject, provided me with the necessary bibliography to work on it,\nand edited my article several times.

These equations are only well-posed after one\nadds renormalization terms. In order to construct a well-defined notion of\nsolution, one should put the equation in a more general setting, like the one\nof regularity structures. In this article, we consider the alternative paradigm\nof paracontrolled distributions, and get concentration results around a stable\ndeterministic equilibrium for solutions of non-autonomous generalizations of\nthe $(\\Phi_3^4)$ model.",
