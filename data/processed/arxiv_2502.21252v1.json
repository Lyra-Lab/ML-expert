  "text": "Short-rate Derivatives in a Higher-for-Longer Environment\nAram Karakhanyan ∗\nTakis Konstantopoulos †\nMatthew Lorig ‡\nEvgenii Samutichev §\nThis version: March 3, 2025\nAbstract\nWe introduce a class of short-rate models that exhibit a “higher for longer” phenomenon. Specifically, the\nshort-rate is modeled as a general time-homogeneous one-factor Markov diffusion on a finite interval. The lower\nendpoint is assumed to be regular, exit or natural according to boundary classification while the upper endpoint\nis assumed to be regular with absorbing behavior. In this setting, we give an explicit expression for price of a\nzero-coupon bond (as well as more general interest rate derivatives) in terms of the transition density of the\nshort-rate under a new probability measure, and the solution of a non-linear ordinary differential equation (ODE).\nWe then narrow our focus to a class of models for which the transition density and ODE can be solved explicitly.\nFor models within this class, we provide conditions under which the lower endpoint is regular, exit and natural.\nFinally, we study two specific models – one in which the lower endpoint is exit and another in which the lower\nendpoint is natural. In these two models, we give an explicit solution of transition density of the short-rate as a\n(generalized) eigenfunction expansion. We provide plots of the transition density, (generalized) eigenfunctions,\nbond prices and the associated yield curve.\nKeywords: short-rate model, interest rate, bond pricing, yield curve, spectral methods\n1\nIntroduction\nBetween January of 2021 to December of 2021, the annual rate of inflation in the United States rose from 1.4% to\n7.0% (source: BLS). Although Treasury Secretary Janet Yellin initially called the rapid rise in inflation “transitory,”\nit had become apparent by early 2022 that high levels of inflation had become entrenched. In an effort get inflation\ndown to its 2% target, between February of 2022 and August of 2023, the Federal Reserve raised its effective rate\nfrom roughly 0.1% to just over 5.3% (source: St. Louis Fed). Despite the historically fast pace of interest rate hikes,\nthe annual rate of inflation in September of 2023 was still sitting at 3.7%, leading Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome\nPowell to declare that interest rates would likely remain “higher for longer.” And, indeed, after topping out 5.32% in\nJuly of 2023, the federal overnight rate remained at this value until August of 2024.\nIn this paper, we present a class of one-factor short-rate models that capture this “higher for longer” phenomenon.\nSpecifically, we assume that the short-rate is modeled as a Markov diffusion on a finite interval. The upper end of\nthe interval is a regular (i.e., accessible) boundary according the Feller’s boundary classification, and is assumed to\n∗Department of Mathematics, University of Edinburgh. e-mail: aram6k@gmail.com\n†Department of Mathematics, Uppsala University. e-mail: takiskonst@gmail.com\n‡Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Washington. e-mail: mlorig@uw.edu\n§Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Washington. e-mail: e.samutichev@gmail.com\n1\narXiv:2502.21252v1  [q-fin.MF]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\nhave absorbing behavior. That is, when the short rate reaches the upper end of the interval, it remains there forever.\nAlthough in reality, the federal reserve will likely lower interest rates when inflation returns to the Federal Reserve’s\n2% target, the absorbing behavior captures the effect of interest rates remaining high for an extended period of time.\nThus, the class of models in this paper can be seen as valid up to some finite time-horizon, after which the short-rate\nmay be lowered. The class of models in this paper has the additional benefit of being analytically tractable, as the\nbond price can be written explicitly.\nThe rest of this paper proceeds as follows: in Section 2 we introduce a class of short-rate models described by a\none-factor Markov diffusion on a finite interval. In this setting, we use risk-neutral pricing to derive an expression\nfor the value of a financial derivative whose payoff depends on the terminal value of the short-rate. We additionally\nrelate the value of this financial derivative to the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE). In Section 3, we\nperform a change of variables that enables us to express the solution of the pricing PDE in terms of the solutions of a\nnonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) and generalized eigenvalue problem. Lastly, in Section 4, we consider\na class of short-rate models for which the ODE and generalized eigenvalue problem described in Section 3 can be\nsolved explicitly. We additionally perform a numerical study of bond prices and the resulting yield curves for two\nspecific examples within this class. The two examples are qualitatively different in that the first example has an exit\nboundary at the origin and the eigenvalue problem has a discrete set of solutions, while the second example has a\nnatural boundary at the origin and the eigenvalue problems has a continuous set of solutions.\n2\nShort-rate model and Pricing\nTo begin, we fix a time horizon T < ∞and consider a continuous-time financial market, defined on a filtered\nprobability space (Ω, F, F, P) with no arbitrage and no transaction costs. The probability measure P represents the\nmarket’s chosen pricing measure taking the money market account M = (Mt)0≤t≤T as numéraire. The filtration\nF = (Ft)0≤t≤T represents the history of the market.\nWe suppose that the money market account M is strictly positive, continuous and non-decreasing. As such, there\nexists a non-negative F-adapted short-rate process X = (Xt)0≤t≤T such that\ndMt = XtMt dt,\nM0 > 0.\nWe will focus on the case in which the dynamics of the short-rate X are described by a Stochastic Differential Equation\n(SDE) of the following form\ndXt = 1{Xt∈(0,L)}\n\u0010\nμ(Xt)dt + σ(Xt)dWt\n\u0011\n,\nX0 ∈[0, L],\n(1)\nwhere W is a (P, F)-Brownian motion. We assume that the drift μ : (0, L) →R and volatility σ : (0, L) →R+ are\nsuch that the origin is either a regular, exit or a natural boundary, and that L is a regular boundary, according to\nFeller’s boundary classification for scalar diffusions Feller (1952). We further assume that X has a unique strong\nsolution up until the first exit time of (0, L). Observe that, as soon as X exits (0, L), we have dXt = 0 due to the\nindicator function on the right-hand side of (1). And thus, the endpoint {0} is an absorbing state if it is a regular or\nexit boundary and endpoint {L} is an absorbing state.\nLet us denote by V = (Vt)0≤t≤T the value of a financial derivative that has a payoff g(XT) at time T ≤T, where\n2\n\n\ng : [0, L] →R. Using standard risk-neutral pricing, we have\nVt\nMt\n= E\n\u0010 VT\nMT\n\f\f\fFt\n\u0011\n,\n0 ≤t ≤T.\nSolving for Vt and using Mt = M0 exp(\nR t\n0 Xsds) and VT = g(XT), we obtain\nVt = E\n\u0010\ne– R T\nt\nXsdsg(XT)\n\f\f\fFt\n\u0011\n=: u(t, Xt),\n(2)\nwhere we have used the Markov property of X to express Vt as a function u : [0, T] × [0, L] →R of (t, Xt). By\nthe Feynman-Kac formula, the function u satisfies the following partial differential equation (PDE) and boundary\nconditions (BCs)\n(∂t + A – x)u = 0,\nu(T, x) = g(x),\n(3)\nu(t, 0) = g(0),\nif 0 is regular or exit,\n(4)\nu(t, L) = e–L(T–t)g(L),\n(5)\nwhere the operator A is the infinitesimal generator of X under P and is given explicitly by\nA = μ(x)∂x + 1\n2σ2(x)∂2\nx .\n(6)\nThroughout this paper we assume that Cauchy problem (3)-(5) has a unique classical solution.\nNotice that the function u defined in (2) depends on the maturity date T and the payoff function g. If we wish to\nemphasize the dependence of u on T and g, we may sometimes write u(t, Xt) ≡u(t, Xt; T, g). For example, denoting\nby BT = (BT\nt )0≤t≤T the price of a zero-coupon bond that pays one unit of currency at the maturity date T and by\nYT = (YT\nt )0≤t≤T the associated yield to maturity, we have\nBT\nt = u(t, Xt; T, 1),\nYT\nt = – log BT\nt\nT – t\n.\n(7)\n3\nSolving the pricing PDE\nIn this section, we will obtain an explicit expression for the solution u of Cauchy problem (3)-(5). The expression we\nobtain will depend on the solution of a first order, nonlinear, ordinary differential equation (ODE) as well as the\n(possibly improper) eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of a linear second-order differential operator. We begin with a\nshort lemma.\nLemma 1. Let u be the unique classical solution of Cauchy problem (3)-(5). Suppose f satisfies the following\nordinary differential equation\n0 = 1\n2σ2(x)(∂x f )2 – Af (x) – x,\n(8)\nwhere the operator A is given by (6). Define the function w : [0, T] × [0, L] →R as follows\nw(t, x) := ef (x)\u0010\nu(t, x) – e–x(T–t)g(x)\n\u0011\n.\n(9)\nThen the function w satisfies the following Cauchy problem\n(∂t + e\nA)w + q = 0,\nw(T, x) = 0,\n(10)\n3\n\n\nw(t, 0) = 0,\nif 0 is regular or exit,\n(11)\nw(t, L) = 0,\n(12)\nwhere the operator e\nA and the function q are given by\ne\nA = eμ(x)∂x + 1\n2σ2(x)∂2\nx\neμ(x) = μ(x) – σ2(x)f ′(x),\nq(t, x) = (∂t + e\nA)e–x(T–t)+f (x)g(x).\n(13)\nProof. First, we have from (3), (4) (5) and (9) that\nw(T, x) := ef (x)\u0010\nu(T, x) – e–x(T–T)g(x)\n\u0011\n= ef (x)\u0010\ng(x) – g(x)\n\u0011\n= 0,\nw(t, 0) := ef (0)\u0010\nu(t, 0) – e–0(T–t)g(0)\n\u0011\n= ef (0)\u0010\ng(0) – g(0)\n\u0011\n= 0,\nw(t, L) := ef (L)\u0010\nu(t, L) – e–L(T–t)g(L)\n\u0011\n= ef (L)\u0010\ne–L(T–t)g(L) – e–L(T–t)g(L)\n\u0011\n= 0,\nwhich establishes the BCs in (10), (11) and (12). Next, we have from (9) that\nu(t, x) = e–f (x)\u0010\nw(t, x) + e–x(T–t)+f (x)g(x)\n\u0011\n.\n(14)\nInserting (14) into (3), multiplying both sides by ef (x) and using the fact that f satisfies (8), we obtain\n0 = ef (x)(∂t + A – x)e–f (x)\u0010\nw(t, x) + e–x(T–t)+f (x)g(x)\n\u0011\n= ef (x)e–f (x)(∂t + e\nA)\n\u0010\nw(t, x) + e–x(T–t)+f (x)g(x)\n\u0011\n= (∂t + e\nA)w(t, x) + q(t, x).\nwhich establishes the PDE in (10).\nAt this point, it will be convenient to introduce the fundamental solution eΓ associated with the operator (∂t + e\nA).\nSpecifically, for any (T, y) ∈[0, T] × [0, L] we define eΓ( · , · ; T, y) : [0, T] × [0, L] →R+ as the unique classical solution\nof\n(∂t + e\nA)eΓ( · , · ; T, y) = 0,\neΓ(T, x; T, y) = δy(x),\n(15)\neΓ(t, 0; T, y) = 0,\nif 0 is regular or exit,\n(16)\neΓ(t, L; T, y) = 0.\n(17)\nRemark 2. Consider the following change of measure\ndeP\ndP := exp\n\u00101\n2\nZ T\n0\nσ2(Xt)(f ′(Xt))2dt –\nZ T\n0\nσ(Xt)f ′(Xt)dWt\n\u0011\n.\n(18)\nWe have from Girsanov’s Theorem that the process f\nW = (f\nWt)0≤t≤T, defined by\ndf\nWt := σ(Xt)f ′(Xt)dt + dWt,\nf\nW0 = 0,\n(19)\nis a (eP, F)-Brownian motion. From (1) and (19), we see that the dynamics of X under eP are\ndXt = 1{Xt∈(0,L)}\n\u0010\neμ(Xt)dt + σ(Xt)dWt\n\u0011\n,\nand the generator of X under eP is the operator e\nA given in (13). If follows that the solution eΓ of (15)-(17) is the\ntransition density of X under eP.\n4\n\n\nWe can now state the main result of this section.\nTheorem 3. The solution u of Cauchy problem (3)-(5) is given by\nu(t, x) = e–x(T–t)g(x) + e–f (x)\nZ T\nt\nds\nZ L\n0\ndξ eΓ(t, x; s, ξ)(∂s + e\nA)e–ξ(T–s)+f (ξ)g(ξ),\n(20)\nwhere the operator e\nA is given by (13) and the functions f and eΓ satisfy (8) and (15)-(17), respectively.\nProof. By Duhamel’s principle, we have from (10) that\nw(t, x) =\nZ T\nt\nds\nZ L\n0\ndξ eΓ(t, x; s, ξ)q(s, ξ),\nwhere eΓ satisfies (15)-(17). Thus, we have from (14) that\nu(t, x) = e–x(T–t)g(x) + e–f (x)\nZ T\nt\nds\nZ L\n0\ndξ eΓ(t, x; s, ξ)q(s, ξ).\n(21)\nEquation (20) follows by inserting expression (13) for q into (21).\nObserve from (21) that, to write the solution u of (3)-(5), we need an expression for a solution f of (8). The following\nProposition gives sufficient conditions on the coefficients μ and σ under which (8) has an explicit solution.\nProposition 4. Suppose μ and σ are given by\nμ(x) = –σ2(x)φ′(x)\n4φ(x)\n,\nσ(x) =\ns\n2x\nφ(x),\n(22)\nfor some non-negative function φ. Then\nf (x) := –\nZ p\nφ(x)dx + c,\n(23)\nis a solution of (8), where c is an arbitrary constant.\nProof. Define F := –f ′. Then we have from (8) that\n0 = F′ + F2 + 2μ\nσ2 F – 2x\nσ2 = F′ + F2 – φ′\n2φF – φ,\n(24)\nwhere the second equality follows from (22). It is easy to see by direction substitution that F = √φ satisfies (24).\nThus, we have from f = –\nR\nFdx that f is given by (23).\nWe note from (21) that, to write the solution u of (3)-(5), we need an expression for the solution eΓ of (15)-(17). To\nthis end, it will be helpful to write the operator e\nA in self-adjoint form. We have\ne\nA =\n1\nem(x)∂x\n1\nes(x)∂x ,\nes(x) := exp\n\u0010\n–\nZ\ndx 2eμ(x)\nσ2(x)\n\u0011\n,\nem(x) :=\n2\nσ2(x) exp\n\u0010 Z\ndx 2eμ(x)\nσ2(x)\n\u0011\n,\n(25)\nwhere we have introduced the scale density es and the speed density em of the operator e\nA. The scale and speed\ndensities will be needed later in this paper to determine the behavior of the short-rate X at the origin.\nAssumption 5. Henceforth, we assume the spectrum of e\nA, denoted σ( e\nA), is simple.\n5\n\n\nNow, consider the following eigenvalue problem\ne\nAψλ = λψλ,\n(26)\nψλ(0) = 0,\nif 0 is regular or exit,\n(27)\nψλ(L) = 0.\n(28)\nIn general, the spectrum of self-adjoint operator e\nA has the decomposition σ( e\nA) = σd( e\nA) ∪σc( e\nA), where σd( e\nA) and\nσc( e\nA) denote the discrete and continuous portions of σ( e\nA), respectively. We will denote by (λn)n∈N = σd( e\nA) the\nset of proper eigenvalues of e\nA and by (λ(ρ))ρ∈R+ = σc( e\nA) the set of improper eigenvalues of e\nA. Similarly, we will\ndenote by (ψn)n∈N the proper eigenfunctions of e\nA, normalized as follows\nψn := ψλn ,\nλn ∈σd(A),\n⟨ψn, ψk⟩e\nm :=\nZ L\n0\nψn(x)ψk(x) em(x)dx = δn,k,\n(29)\nand by (ψ(ρ, · ))ρ∈R+ the improper eigenfunctions of e\nA, normalized according to\nψ(ρ, · ) := ψλ(ρ),\nλ(ρ) ∈σc(A),\nZ L\n0\nψ(ρ, x)ψ(ρ′, x) em(x)dx = δ(ρ – ρ′),\n(30)\nwhere λ(ρ) = –cρ2 for some c > 0. Then, under Assumption 5, we have from (Hanson and Yakovlev, 2013, Chapter\n5) that the solution eΓ of (15)-(17) has the following (generalized) eigenfunction representation\neΓ(t, x; T, y) = em(y)\n\u0010 X\nn∈N\neλn(T–t)ψn(x)ψn(y) +\nZ ∞\n0\neλ(ρ)(T–t)ψ(ρ, x)ψ(ρ, y)dρ\n\u0011\n.\n(31)\nThus, we need only to solve eigenvalue problem (26)-(28) to construct the transition density eΓ. The following\nproposition, which is based on the transformation to Liouville normal form (DLMF, Chapter 1), can be helpful\nto find solutions of the eigenvalue equation (26) in the case where μ and σ are given by (22) for some non-negative\nfunction φ.\nProposition 6. Let φ be a non-negative function. Suppose μ and σ are given by (22). Then the scale density\nes(x), the speed density em(x), defined in (25), are given by\nes(x) = C\np\nφ(x) exp\n\u0010\n– 2\nZ\ndx\np\nφ(x)\n\u0011\n,\nem(x) =\np\nφ(x)\nCx\nexp\n\u0010\n2\nZ\ndx\np\nφ(x)\n\u0011\n,\n(32)\nwhere C is an arbitrary constant, and the operator e\nA is given by\ne\nA =\n\u0010\n2x\np\nφ(x)\n– xφ′(x)\n2φ2(x)\n\u0011\n∂x +\nx\nφ(x)∂2\nx ,\n(33)\nSuppose ψλ is a (possibly improper) eigenfunction of e\nA, which satisfies (26)-(28). Define functions p and ηλ\nthrough the following equations\np(x) :=\nZ\ndx\n1\nσ(x),\nψλ(x) = ηλ(p(x))\np\nσ(x)es(x),\n(34)\nThen ηλ satisfies\n1\n2η′′\nλ – Vηλ = ληλ,\nV(z) := U(p–1(z)),\nU(x) := φ′(x)\n8φ2(x) +\n3\n16xφ(x) + x,\n(35)\nηλ(p(0)) = 0,\nif 0 is regular or exit,\n(36)\nηλ(p(L)) = 0,\n(37)\nwhere p–1 is the inverse of p.\n6\n\n\nProof. The expressions for em, es and e\nA can be computed directly from (13), (22), (23) and (25). Next, using (26)\nand (34), we have\n0 =\n1\np\nσ(x)es(x)\n( e\nA – λ)ψλ(x) = 1\n2η′′\nλ(p(x)) – U(x)ηλ(p(x)) – ηλ(p(x)).\nSetting x = p–1(z), we obtain (35). The BCs (36)-(37) for ηλ follow from the BCs (27)-(28) for ψλ and (34).\n4\nA class of analytically tractable models\nIn this section, we analyze a class of models for the short rate X in which the drift μ and volatility σ are given by\n(22) with the function φ being given by\nφ(x) = 2\na2 x 2k–1,\na > 0.\n(38)\nInserting (38) into (22) we obtain\nσ(x) = ax 1–k,\nμ(x) = a2\u0010\n1\n4 – k\n2\n\u0011\nx 1–2k.\n(39)\nThus, we have from (1) and (39) that the dynamics of the short-rate X = (Xt)0≤t≤T are given by\ndXt = 1{Xt∈(0,L)}\n\u0010\na2(1\n4 – k\n2 )X1–2k\nt\ndt + aX1–k\nt\ndWt\n\u0011\n,\nX0 ∈[0, L],\n(40)\nRemark 7. k = 0 corresponds to a geometric Brownian motion with μ = a2\n4 and σ = a.\nIt then follows from (33) that the operator e\nA is given by\ne\nA =\n\u0010\na2\u0000 1\n4 – k\n2\n\u0001\nx 1–2k + a\np\n2x 3–2k\n\u0011\n∂x + 1\n2a2x 2–2k∂2\nx ,\n(41)\nand from (32) the scale density es and the speed density em are given by\nes(x) =\n\n\n\n\n\nCx k– 1\n2 exp\n\u0012\n–\n2\n√\n2\na(k+ 1\n2 )x k+ 1\n2\n\u0013\n,\nk ̸= – 1\n2\nCx –1– 2\n√\n2\na ,\nk = – 1\n2\n,\n(42)\nem(x) =\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nCa2 x k– 3\n2 exp\n\u0012\n2\n√\n2\na(k+ 1\n2 )x k+ 1\n2\n\u0013\n,\nk ̸= – 1\n2\n2\nCa2 x –2+ 2\n√\n2\na ,\nk = – 1\n2\n,\n(43)\nIn order to write spectral representation of the transition density (31) for the short-rate (40), we must determine the\nstructure of the spectrum σ( e\nA) of the diffusion generator e\nA (41), which depends on whether the origin is regular,\nexit or natural. This will also determine if a BC (16) is needed at the origin.\nProposition 8. Fix an interval (0, L) and consider the operator e\nA given by (41). For k ∈(–∞, 0] the origin is\nnatural, for k ∈(0, 1/2] the origin is exit, and for k ∈(1/2, ∞) the origin is regular.\nProof. See Appendix A.\nUsing (34) and (35) we have for k ̸= 0 that\nz = p(x) = x k/ak,\nU(x) = 1\n32x –2k \u0010\n32x 2k+1 + a2(4k + 1)\n\u0011\n,\nV(z) = (akz)1/k + 1 + 4k\n32k2z 2 ,\n(44)\n7\n\n\nand for k = 0 we have\nz = p(x) = 1\na log x,\nU(x) = x + a2\n32 ,\nV(z) = ez + a2\n32 .\n(45)\nThus, from (35), (36) and (37), we have for k ̸= 0 that (ηλ, λ) satisfy\n1\n2η′′\nλ(z) –\n\u0010\n(akz)1/k + 1 + 4k\n32k2z 2\n\u0011\nηλ(z) = ληλ(z),\n(46)\nηλ(0k/ak) = 0,\nif 0 is regular or exit,\nηλ(Lk/ak) = 0.\nFor k = 0 the origin is a natural boundary by Proposition 8. Hence, we have\n1\n2η′′\nλ(z) –\n\u0010\nez + a2\n32\n\u0011\nηλ(z) = ληλ(z),\nηλ(log L\na\n) = 0.\n(47)\nNotice that when k ≤0, after the Liouville transformation z = p(x) as in (44) and (45), the origin turns into –∞,\nwhich plays a role in the following decomposition of spectrum σ( e\nA).\nProposition 9. Fix an interval (0, L) and consider the operator e\nA given by (41). For k > 0 the spectrum is\npurely discrete, i.e. σ( e\nA) = σd( e\nA) ⊂(–∞, 0), for k < 0 the spectrum is purely continuous σ( e\nA) = σc( e\nA) = (–∞, 0],\nand for k = 0 the spectrum is mixed, with discrete portion σd( e\nA) ⊂(– a2\n32 , 0] clustering at – a2\n32 and continuous\nportion σc( e\nA) = (–∞, – a2\n32 ].\nProof. Notice that the right endpoint L is always regular. By Proposition 8 in case k > 0 the origin is either exit\nor regular. According to Linetsky (2007) regular and exit boundaries are always non-oscillatory. Therefore, both\nendpoints in this case are non-oscillatory and the operator e\nA is of the spectral category I (i.e., its spectrum is purely\ndiscrete and lies in (–∞, 0]).\nFor k ≤0, the origin is natural by Proposition 8. From (44) and (45) we have\nlim\nx→0+ p(x) = –∞,\ni.e., the origin is transformed into –∞by Liouville transformation (34). Then, we investigate the potential U(x) in\n(44) and (45). We have\nΛ := lim\nx→0 U(x) =\n\n\n\na2\n32 ,\nk = 0,\n0,\nk < 0.\nAs this limit is finite, the origin is an oscillatory boundary with cutoff –Λ. This, together with L being regular and\nthus non-oscillatory, implies that the operator e\nA is of the spectral category II.

Finally, since the spectrum is purely discrete, i.e. σ( e\nA) = σp( e\nA) and σc( e\nA) = 0, the expression\nfor the transition density eΓ(t, x; T, y) (55) follows from the general spectral representation (31).\nC\nSpectral representation for the natural boundary case\nIn practice, when the origin is natural and, consequently, the continuous spectrum is nonempty (see Proposition\n9), the eigenfunction representation is written by finding the Green’s function first (Borodin and Salminen, 2002,\nChapter 2)\nGλ(x, y) = ψλ(min(x, y))φλ(max(x, y))\nwλ\n,\nwλ :=\n1\nes(x)\n\u0000ψ′\nλ(x)φλ(x) – ψλ(x)φ′\nλ(x)\n\u0001\n,\n(79)\nwhere ψλ(x) and φλ(x) are solutions of (26) s.t. ψλ is increasing, while φλ is decreasing and satisfies (28). Both\nfunctions should satisfy some additional conditions at the origin to ensure Green’s function uniqueness, that is\nψλ(0+) := lim\nx→0+ ψλ(x) = 0,\nφλ(0+) := lim\nx→0+ φλ(x) = +∞,\nψ+\nλ (0+) :=\nlim\nh→0+\nψλ(0 + h) – ψλ(0+)\nS(0, h]\n= 0,\nφ+\nλ (0+) =\nlim\nh→0+\nφλ(0 + h) – φλ(0+)\nS(0, h]\n= –∞,\nwhere S(0, h] is defined as in (70). These conditions will typically be satisfied for ψλ and φλ under the prior\nassumptions, but when they are not, one must change ψλ and φλ accordingly. Under the aforementioned conditions\non ψλ(x) and φλ(x), the Wronskian wλ (79) will be independent of x which justifies the notation.\n15\n\n\nThen, applying inverse Laplace transform to (79) results in\neΓ(t, x; T, y) = em(y)\n2πi\nZ c+i∞\nc–i∞\neλ(T–t)Gλ(x, y)dλ,\n(80)\nwhich produces a discrete part of (31) when the Green’s function has isolated singularities, and a continuous part\nwhen there is a branch cut for λ.\nD\nProof of Proposition 13\nFrom Proposition 8 the origin is a natural boundary, and from Proposition 9 the spectrum is purely continuous in\n(–∞, 0). Plugging k = –1/2 into (39), (42), (43) with C = 1, and (44) we get\nσ(x) = ax 3/2,\nes(x) = x –1– 2\n√\n2\na ,\nem(x) = 2\na2 x –2+ 2\n√\n2\na ,\np(x) = –\n2\na√x .\n(81)\nFrom (46) we derive the following equation\nη′′ =\n1\n4z 2 (8λz 2 + 2a2z 4 + 3)η.\nThe general solution to this ODE is given by (49). First, we return back to the original variable x by plugging (49)\nand (81) (34). This results in the general solution of the eigenvalue equation (26)\nψλ(x) = c1x –\n√\n2\na J 2\n√\n2\na\n\u0012\n2i\n√\n2\na\nq\nλ\nx\n\u0013\n+ c2x –\n√\n2\na Y 2\n√\n2\na\n\u0012\n2i\n√\n2\na\nq\nλ\nx\n\u0013\n,\n(82)\nwhere Jα(z), Yα(z) are the Bessel functions.

    "abstract": "We introduce a class of short-rate models that exhibit a ``higher for\nlonger'' phenomenon. Specifically, the short-rate is modeled as a general\ntime-homogeneous one-factor Markov diffusion on a finite interval. The lower\nendpoint is assumed to be regular, exit or natural according to boundary\nclassification while the upper endpoint is assumed to be regular with absorbing\nbehavior. In this setting, we give an explicit expression for price of a\nzero-coupon bond (as well as more general interest rate derivatives) in terms\nof the transition density of the short-rate under a new probability measure,\nand the solution of a non-linear ordinary differential equation (ODE). We then\nnarrow our focus to a class of models for which the transition density and ODE\ncan be solved explicitly. For models within this class, we provide conditions\nunder which the lower endpoint is regular, exit and natural. Finally, we study\ntwo specific models -- one in which the lower endpoint is exit and another in\nwhich the lower endpoint is natural. In these two models, we give an explicit\nsolution of transition density of the short-rate as a (generalized)\neigenfunction expansion. We provide plots of the transition density,\n(generalized) eigenfunctions, bond prices and the associated yield curve.",
