Accurately quantifying this obscuration is crucial for interpreting galaxy spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs). The extinction curves in the Milky Way (MW) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) exhibit a strong feature known as the\n2175Å UV bump, most often attributed to small carbonaceous dust grains. This feature was recently detected in faint galaxies\nout to 𝑧∼7 suggesting rapid formation channels. Here we report the detection of a strong UV bump in a luminous Lyman-break\ngalaxy at 𝑧= 7.11235, GNWY-7379420231, through observations taken as part of the NIRSpec Wide GTO survey. We fit a dust\nattenuation curve that is consistent with the MW extinction curve within 1𝜎, in a galaxy just ∼700 Myr after the Big Bang.\nFrom the integrated spectrum, we infer a young mass-weighted age (𝑡★∼22−59 Myr) for this galaxy, however spatially resolved\nSED fitting unveils the presence of an older stellar population (𝑡★∼252 Myr). Furthermore, morphological analysis provides\nevidence for a potential merger. The underlying older stellar population suggests the merging system could be pre-enriched, with\nthe dust illuminated by a merger-induced starburst. Moreover, turbulence driven by stellar feedback in this bursty region may\nbe driving PAH formation through top-down shattering. The presence of a UV bump in GNWY-7379420231 solidifies growing\nevidence for the rapid evolution of dust properties within the first billion years of cosmic time.\nKey words: galaxies: high-redshift – dark ages, reionization – methods: observational – dust, extinction\n1 INTRODUCTION\nDust is a fundamental component of the interstellar medium (ISM)\nwithin galaxies, and affects the spectral energy distribution (SED) of\ngalaxies over the observable wavelength range. Dust grains absorb\n★E-mail: arikorme@ljmu.ac.uk\napproximately half of the optical and ultraviolet (UV) light and re-\nemit the absorbed energy as infrared light, which has important\nimplications on the observational properties of galaxies (Kennicutt\n& Evans 2012; Schneider & Maiolino 2024). The dust attenuation\ncurve of a galaxy describes how the integrated luminosity of a galaxy\nis affected by absorption and scattering of photons along the line of\nsight (LOS) due to dust in the ISM, and results from a combination\n© 2025 The Authors\narXiv:2502.21119v1  [astro-ph.GA]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\n2\nK. Ormerod et al.\nof dust grain properties, dust content, and the spatial distribution\nof dust (e.g., Salim & Narayanan 2020; Markov et al. 2023, 2024).\nAn understanding of a galaxy’s attenuation curve is crucial for the\nderivation of robust physical parameters, which can vary significantly\ndepending on the assumed attenuation curve (e.g., Kriek & Conroy\n2013; Shivaei et al. 2020; Reddy et al. 2015; Salim et al. 2016; Salim\n& Narayanan 2020; Markov et al. 2023).\nDust in galaxies can be characterised using both extinction curves,\nmeasured along sightlines to individual stars, and attenuation curves\ndescribing the integrated light of galaxies. Attenuation curves incor-\nporate effects arising from the star-dust geometry within galaxies,\nsuch as scattering back into the line of sight, and contribution from\nunobscured stars (Salim & Narayanan 2020). Common examples\ninclude the Calzetti attenuation curve (Calzetti et al. 1994, 2000)\nderived from local starburst galaxies, and the Milky Way (MW)\n(Cardelli et al. 1989), Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) extinction curves (Fitzpatrick & Massa\n1986; Gordon et al. 2003, 2024). The MW extinction curve exhibits\na ‘UV bump’ feature at 2175Å, while the LMC extinction curve\ncontains a weaker UV bump, but stronger far ultraviolet (FUV) rise\nthan the MW curve. In general, these dust curves vary in the slope in\nthe UV/optical range, and the presence (or absence) of a UV bump.\nIt has also been shown that galaxies in the local universe exhibit a\nwide range of dust attenuation curves, which can, for instance, be\nparameterised with the Salim dust curve (Salim et al. 2018). This\nparameterisation is a modified Calzetti curve which allows the slope\nof the curve to vary, and allows for the presence or absence of a\nUV bump. The UV bump strength is thought to vary with the slope\nof the dust attenuation curve, such that flatter attenuation curves\ndisplay a weaker bump strength (Kriek & Conroy 2013; Narayanan\net al. 2018). It has also been shown that for galaxies with fixed opti-\ncal depth, galaxies with higher metallicities have flatter attenuation\ncurves but stronger UV bump strengths (Shivaei et al. 2020), indi-\ncating a lower prevalence of the dust grains responsible for the UV\nbump at low metallicity.\nThe UV bump is a strong feature seen in the dust attenuation\ncurve of some galaxies, and was first detected in MW sightlines by\nStecher (1965). The origin of this feature is not well known (Draine\n1989), and was initially suggested to be caused by graphite (Stecher\n& Donn 1965). Today, this feature is most commonly attributed\nto nanoparticles containing aromatic carbon (C), such as polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (e.g., Joblin et al. 1992; Bradley et al.\n2005; Shivaei et al. 2022), or nano-sized graphite grains (Li & Draine\n2001). Other interpretations, including a random arrangement of\nmicroscopic sp2 carbon chips, have also been proposed (Papoular\n& Papoular 2009). PAHs are hydrocarbon molecules with C atoms\narranged in a honeycomb structure of fused aromatic rings with\nperipheral H atoms, and are abundant in the ISM (Tielens 2008).\nBeyond the local Universe, this feature has only been seen spec-\ntroscopically in metal-enriched galaxies at 0.01 ≤𝑧≤3 (e.g., Noll\net al. 2007; Noll et al. 2009; Shivaei et al. 2022), and was first seen\nin a galaxy at 𝑧> 3 in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z6-0 at 𝑧= 6.71\n(Witstok et al. 2023), with tentative evidence of a higher peak wave-\nlength than that typically observed within the MW, suggesting a\ndiffering mixture of carbonaceous grains (Blasberger et al. 2017).\nThe UV bump has since been detected in individual galaxies at red-\nshifts up to 𝑧∼7.55 (Markov et al. 2023, 2024; Fisher et al. 2025)\nwhen the Universe was only ∼700 Myr old. The presence of the UV\nbump at such early times challenges existing models of dust forma-\ntion. Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars provide a likely origin for\nPAHs (Latter 1991), and the standard production channel of carbona-\nceous dust grains is thought to be through low mass (≤3𝑀⊙) AGB\nstars reaching the end of their main-sequence lifetime on timescales\nexceeding 300 Myr. If this is the dominant production channel of\nPAHs, the detection of the UV bump at 𝑧∼7 implies that the onset\nof star formation occurred at 𝑧≥10 (Witstok et al. 2023). For a\ngalaxy where the onset of star formation occurs at 𝑧= 10, low-mass\nAGB stars would begin dust production at 𝑧∼7, so it is expected that\nsupernovae (SNe) instead dominate dust production, with dust pro-\nducing SNe II occurring ∼10 Myr after the onset of star formation\n(see Schneider & Maiolino 2024 for a review). Supporting the idea of\nearly dust production, enhanced carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios are\nseen in metal-poor stars in the MW, and have now been observed\nin GS-z12, a galaxy at 𝑧= 12.5 (D’Eugenio et al. 2024). While the\nchemical enrichment pattern of GS-z12 is inconsistent with pure SNe\nII yields, low-energy Population III SNe yields may explain the C/O\nlower limit (Vanni et al. 2023; D’Eugenio et al. 2024). Furthermore,\nit has also been suggested that the slope of the attenuation curve\nflattens and the strength of the UV bump weakens with increasing\nredshift due to the grain size distribution changing, with larger dust\ngrains at earlier epochs (Makiya & Hirashita 2022), which could be\ndue to SNe being the prominent channel of dust formation.\nThe dust attenuation curves of high redshift galaxies remained\nlargely unconstrained until the launch of the James Webb Space Tele-\nscope (JWST; McElwain et al. 2023; Rigby et al. 2023). With the\nNear-infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec; Jakobsen et al. 2022; Böker\net al. 2023) onboard JWST, we are now able to explore the dust atten-\nuation curves of high redshift galaxies in more detail with successful\ndetections of the UV bump (Witstok et al. 2023; Markov et al. 2023,\n2024) out to redshifts of 8, place constraints on the nebular attenua-\ntion curve of a galaxy at 𝑧= 4.41 (Sanders et al. 2024), and explore\nthe redshift evolution of dust attenuation curves (e.g., Markov et al.\n2024), where it has been suggested that the attenuation curve flattens\nwith increasing redshift independent of 𝐴𝑉.\nHere, we combine NIRSpec Wide GTO observations with data\nfrom the JWST/Near-infrared Camera (NIRCam; Rieke et al. 2023)\nto investigate the presence of a UV bump in a galaxy at 𝑧= 7.11235.\nThis system is potentially undergoing a merger, allowing us to explore\nthe implications of these findings for dust formation in the early\nUniverse. This paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we discuss\nthe observations used in this work, in Section 3 we discuss our\nmethods and analysis, and we place these into the context of galaxy\nand dust formation in Section 4. Finally, our findings are summarised\nin Section 5. Throughout this paper, we assume a standard cosmology\nof 𝐻0 = 70 kms−1Mpc−1, Ω𝑚= 0.3, and ΩΛ = 0.7 and a solar\nabundance of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.69 (Asplund et al. 2021). All\nmagnitudes are quoted in the AB magnitude system (Oke & Gunn\n1983), and galaxy sizes refer to the half-light radius.\n2 OBSERVATIONS\nGNWY-7379420231, at 𝑧= 7.11235, was observed as part of\nthe NIRSpec Wide Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) Program\n(Maseda et al. 2024, henceforth referred to as Wide). The Wide sur-\nvey covers the five extragalactic deep fields of the Cosmic Assembly\nNear-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS; Gro-\ngin et al. 2011; Koekemoer et al. 2011) with 31 pointings, covering\n≈320 arcmin2 in 105 hours. As part of the high priority targets in the\nWide survey, IRAC-excess sources from Smit et al. (2015); Roberts-\nBorsani et al. (2016) are observed, i.e. galaxies at 𝑧= 6−8 with strong\noptical emission lines determined from Spitzer/IRAC photometry. At\nthe time of writing, the sample of IRAC-excess sources is made up\nof 23 galaxies, covering a redshift range of 𝑧= 5.66 −7.65. Through\nMNRAS 000, 1–16 (2025)\n\n\nThe 2175Å UV Bump in the EoR\n3\nvisual inspection of these sources, we identify the presence of a\nstrong UV bump in GNWY-7379420231 only. We show a tentative\nUV bump detection in EGSZ-9135048459, at 𝑧= 6.74, in Appendix\nA.\nGNWY-7379420231 was originally identified as a Lyman break\ncandidate at 𝑧phot = 8.29 in Bouwens et al. (2015), and identified\nas a Spitzer/IRAC-excess source in Roberts-Borsani et al. (2016).\nSubsequent Keck/MOSFIRE observations in Roberts-Borsani et al.\n(2023) revealed Ly-𝛼emission, confirming a spectroscopic redshift\nof 𝑧Ly𝛼= 7.10813 ± 0.00019.\n2.1 Spectroscopic Observations\nThe low-resolution spectrum was obtained using PRISM/CLEAR\n(PRISM hereafter), covering a wavelength range of 0.6𝜇m −5.3𝜇m\nat a spectral resolution of 𝑅≈100 (varying from 30−300 for a uni-\nformly illuminated shutter; Jakobsen et al. 2022). High-resolution\nspectra were obtained using the G235H and G395H gratings (and\nassociated F170LP and F290LP filters), providing wavelength cov-\nerage of 1.66𝜇m −3.05𝜇m and 2.78𝜇m −5.14𝜇m, respectively, at a\nspectral resolution of 𝑅≈2700.\nFor the PRISM spectrum, 1 exposure with 55 groups was taken,\nusing the NRSIRS2RAPID read-out mode (Rauscher et al. 2017)\nwith a 3-point nodding pattern to cycle through the 3 shutter-slitlet\nper target. This results in an effective exposure time of 2451 s. The\nhigh resolution gratings were nodded between the two outer shutter\npositions to minimise source self-subtraction in the 𝑧\n=\n1 −3\ngalaxies in Wide. For the G235H grating, 1 exposure with 55 groups\nwas taken for each of the two nodding positions (1634s total) and\nfor the G395H grating 1 exposure with 60 groups was taken (1780s\ntotal).\n2.2 NIRSpec Data Reduction\nWe use the same core reduction process as other NIRSpec Multi-\nObject Spectroscopy (MOS) GTO surveys (e.g., Curtis-Lake et al.\n2023; Cameron et al. 2023; Carniani et al. 2024; Bunker et al. 2024;\nSaxena et al. 2024) developed by the ESA NIRSpec Science Oper-\nations Team (SOT) and GTO teams, as described in Carniani et al.\n(2024). Most of the pipeline uses the same algorithms as the offi-\ncial Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) pipeline (Alves de\nOliveira et al. 2018; Ferruit et al. 2022), with small survey-specific\nmodifications (Maseda et al. 2024). We use a finer grid in wavelength\nwith regular steps in the 2D rectification process. We also estimate\npath losses for each source by taking the relative intra-shutter posi-\ntion into account and assuming a point-like morphology, as in Bunker\net al. (2024); Curti et al. (2024a). The Wide reduction differs from\nother GTO reductions in the sigma-clipping algorithm used to ex-\nclude outliers when creating the 1D spectrum, which does not work\nwell with a low number of exposures as in Wide, and does not ac-\ncount for Poisson noise from bright pixels, which is typical for many\nWide targets. Therefore, the reductions used in this work skip this\nstep.\n2.3 NIRCam Imaging\nWe use NIRCam imaging of the Great Observatories Origins Deep\nSurvey (Giavalisco et al. 2004) North (GOODS-N) field, obtained\nas part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES;\nEisenstein et al. 2023) from programme 1181 (PI: Eisenstein). Nine\nfilters in total are used within these observations: F090W, F115W,\nF150W, F200W, F277W, F335M, F356W, F410M and F444W. The\nreduction of these images closely follows the method used in Rieke\net al. (2023).\n2.4 Aperture Correction\nWe use NIRCam photometry extracted within Kron apertures with\nKron parameter equal to 1.2 (𝑅Kron,s) as high signal-to-noise esti-\nmates of flux in each filter band. For a galaxy with a Sérsic index of\n𝑛= 1, 𝑅Kron,s corresponds to the half-light radius (Graham & Driver\n2005). We use the Kron photometry extracted in apertures with Kron\nparameter equal to 2.5 (𝑅Kron) to determine the ratio 𝑅Kron/𝑅Kron,s\nin the F444W band to estimate the amount of flux missed by the\nsmaller apertures. We then correct all 𝑅Kron,s fluxes by this factor to\nobtain our final flux values.\nIn order to correct the spectrum to account for flux outside the slit,\nwe first derive synthetic photometry of the NIRSpec spectrum us-\ning the NIRCam filter curves. We then multiply the spectrum by the\nmedian ratio of the scaled 𝑅Kron,s photometry to the synthetic pho-\ntometry, excluding F090W where the source is not detected. The 1D\nand 2D spectra are shown in Figure 1 with the NIRCam photometry\nand filter curves.\n3 METHODS AND ANALYSIS\n3.1 Spectroscopic Redshift\nWe estimate the spectroscopic redshift with msaexp1 (Brammer\n2023) using eazy templates (Brammer et al. 2008), as in Maseda et al.\n(2024). From this, we obtain a spectroscopic redshift of 𝑧= 7.11235.\n3.2 UV Magnitudes and Slopes\nWe convert the JWST NIRCam F150W apparent magnitude (𝑚UV) to\ngive UV absolute magnitude (𝑀UV), which is reported in Table 1. We\nmodel the UV continuum slope of the galaxy considered here with a\npower law 𝐹𝜆∝𝜆𝛽. We measure this slope within the fitting windows\ndefined in Calzetti et al. (1994), excluding the windows redwards of\n1833Å to exclude the UV bump region and the Ciii]𝜆𝜆1907, 1909\ndoublet (Ciii]). We include a fitting window at 2580 −2640Å to\nreduce the uncertainty on the fit.\nWe use a Bayesian fitting procedure to fit the rest-frame UV con-\ntinuum using a python implementation of the multinest nested\nsampling algorithm (Feroz et al. 2009), pymultinest (Buchner et al.\n2014). We use a Gaussian prior distribution for the power-law index,\ncentred on 𝜇𝛽= −2, with a standard deviation of 𝜎𝛽= 0.5, and a\nflat prior on the normalisation at 𝜆rest = 1500Å (between 0 and twice\nthe maximum flux value of the spectrum in the fitting regions). The\nbest-fit value of 𝛽is given by the 50th percentile (median) of the\nposterior distribution, with the 16th and 84th percentiles given as a\n±1𝜎confidence range. The UV slope fit is shown in Figure 2.\n3.3 UV Bump Identification\nTo determine the robustness of the UV bump feature, we follow the\nmethod defined in Witstok et al. (2023). We fit power laws in four\nadjacent wavelength windows defined by Noll et al. (2007), with\npower-law indices 𝛾1 to 𝛾4. While the 𝛾3 region begins at 1920Å in\n1 https://github.com/gbrammer/msaexp\nMNRAS 000, 1–16 (2025)\n\n\n4\nK.

The\nlocation of the 2175Å UV bump is shown by the dashed red vertical line, and the locations of key emission lines are shown by dashed grey lines. The transmission\ncurves for each photometric filter used are also shown. The inset panel shows a PSF-matched RGB image of GNWY-7379420231 (R: F444W, G: F200W, B:\nF150W) with the location of the NIRSpec slitlets outlined in solid white lines.\nNoll et al. (2007), we exclude the region 1920Å < 𝜆emit <1950Å to\nensure we avoid contamination from the Ciii] doublet. The parameter\n𝛾34 ≡𝛾3 −𝛾4 is used to identify the presence of the absorption\nfeature centred on 2175Å, where a more prominent UV bump being\npresent results in a more negative value of 𝛾34 (Noll et al. 2009).\nPrior to fitting the wavelength windows, the spectrum is smoothed\nwith a running median filter of 15 pixels. The uncertainty of the\nrunning median is estimated with a bootstrapping procedure, where\neach of the 15 pixels is randomly perturbed according to their formal\nuncertainty for 100 iterations.\nWe choose flat prior distributions for the power law indices within\nthe range −10 < 𝛾𝑖< 1, and normalise at the centre of each wave-\nlength window, between 0 and twice the maximum value of the flux\nin each fitting region. The best-fit value of 𝛾34 is given by the median\nof the posterior distribution obtained by simultaneously fitting 𝛾3\nand 𝛾4, with the 16th and 84th percentiles given as a ±1𝜎confidence\nrange.\n3.4 UV Bump Fitting\nAs in Witstok et al. (2023), we parameterise the UV bump\nprofile\nby\ndefining\nthe\nexcess\nattenuation\nas\n𝐴𝜆, bump\n=\n−2.5 log10\n\u0000𝐹𝜆/𝐹𝜆, cont\n\u0001, where 𝐹𝜆is the observed flux, and 𝐹𝜆, cont\nis the UV continuum slope, without a UV bump (Shivaei et al. 2022).\nWe use the running median and its corresponding uncertainty (see\nSection 3.3) to compute the significance of the negative flux ex-\ncess of the spectrum with respect to the power-law UV slope (𝛽UV),\ndetermined in Section 3.2.\nWe use the multinest nested sampling algorithm to fit the excess\nattenuation 𝐴𝜆, bump with a Drude profile (Fitzpatrick & Massa\n1986). Centred on rest-frame wavelength 𝜆max, this is defined as\n𝐴𝜆, bump = 𝐴𝜆,max\n𝛾2/𝜆2\n\u0010\n1/𝜆2 −1/𝜆2max\n\u00112\n+ 𝛾2/𝜆2\n(1)\nwhere the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is given by FWHM=\n𝛾𝜆2max. We fix 𝛾= 250Å/(2175Å)2 which corresponds to FWHM=\n250Å if 𝜆max = 2175Å, in agreement with findings for 𝑧∼2 star-\nforming galaxies (Noll et al. 2009; Shivaei et al. 2022). We note that\nallowing the FWHM to vary does not affect the other parameters.\nMNRAS 000, 1–16 (2025)\n\n\nThe 2175Å UV Bump in the EoR\n5\nWe carry out the fitting procedure in a region of 1950Å < 𝜆emit <\n2580Å, which includes the 𝛾3 and 𝛾4 regions, but excludes the Ciii]\ndoublet. We use a gamma distribution with shape parameter 𝑎= 1\nand scale 𝜃= 0.2 as a prior for bump amplitude, 𝐴𝜆,max. This favours\nthe lowest amplitudes, although a flat prior gives comparable results.\nWe use a flat prior for the central wavelength in the range 2100Å\n< 𝜆max < 2300Å. The UV bump fit is shown in Figure 2, with best-\nfit values listed in Table 1. We compare this model to a simple power-\nlaw using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The significantly\nlower BIC value for the UV bump model (ΔBIC = 66.7) indicates\nthat this model is preferred over a simple power-law model.\n3.5 SED Fitting\nWe model the SED of GNWY-7379420231 using bagpipes (Bayesian\nAnalysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStima-\ntion; Carnall et al. 2018, 2019), fitting both the photometry and\nspectroscopy simultaneously. We use Binary Population and Spec-\ntral Synthesis (bpass) v2.2.1 models (Stanway & Eldridge 2018),\nwith models that include binary stars. We use the default bpass initial\nmass function \"135_300\" (IMF; stellar mass from 0.1M⊙to 300M⊙\nand a slope of −2.35 for 𝑀> 0.5M⊙). We mask the region around\nLy𝛼(1200 Å < 𝜆emit < 1250 Å) to mitigate any potential effects\nfrom Lyman-𝛼damping-wing absorption. We also mask the region\n4900 Å < 𝜆emit < 5100 Å in the spectrum due to small discrepan-\ncies between the [Oiii] equivalent widths (EW) in the spectroscopy\nand photometry. While bagpipes can account for small wavelength-\ndependent variations between the spectroscopy and photometry, it is\nnot flexible enough to solve for emission line discrepancies.\nWe assume a non-parametric star formation history (SFH) from\nLeja et al. (2019), which fits the star formation rates in fixed time bins,\nwhere ΔlogSFR between bins is linked by a Student’s t-distribution.\nAs in Tacchella et al. (2022), we fit a ‘continuity’ model, with 𝜎=\n0.3 and 𝜈= 2, which is weighted against rapid transitions in star\nformation rate, and a ‘bursty continuity’ model with 𝜎= 1 and\n𝜈= 2, which allows more variation in star formation rate (SFR) (i.e.,\na more bursty star formation history). We fix the redshift of the galaxy\nto 𝑧= 7.11235, and fit the SFH in 6 bins of lookback time 𝑡, with the\nfirst bins fixed to 0 Myr < t < 3 Myr and 3 Myr < t < 10 Myr, and the\nremaining 4 bins equally log-spaced in lookback time until 𝑡(𝑧= 20).\nWe note that the inferred SFH is largely insensitive to the number\nof bins used as long as 𝑁bins ≥4 (Leja et al. 2019). We favour the\n‘bursty continuity’ model as this flexible SFH accommodates both\nstochastic star formation and underlying older stellar populations.\nIt should be noted that this model still allows smooth or declining\nSFHs if favoured during the fitting (see Harvey et al. 2025). We\nreduce the star formation timescale to 10 Myr to account for the\nincreased specific star formation rate (sSFR), compared to galaxies\nat lower redshift.\nThe allowed total stellar mass formed and stellar metallicities are\nallowed to vary uniformly between 105 M⊙< M★< 1012 M⊙, and\n0 < 𝑍∗< 0.5 Z⊙, respectively. Nebular emission is included using\na grid of cloudy (Ferland et al. 2017) models, parameterised by\nthe ionisation parameter (−3 < log10U < −0.5), which bagpipes\ncomputes self-consistently. We use the Salim et al. (2018) dust at-\ntenuation curve, which parameterises the dust curve shape with a\npower-law deviation 𝛿from the Calzetti et al. (2000) model (𝛿= 0\nfor the Calzetti curve) and includes a Drude profile to model the\n2175Å bump. The strength of the bump is given by the amplitude 𝐵,\nin units of 𝐴bump /𝐸(𝐵−𝑉) where 𝐴bump is the extra attenuation\nat 2175Å. We keep the central wavelength and width of the bump\nfixed at 2175Å and 250Å, respectively. We use uniform priors for 𝛿\n(−0.5 < 𝛿< 0.2) and 𝐵(0 < 𝐵< 10), and a Gaussian prior on the\nV-band dust attenuation with 𝜇𝐴𝑉= 0.15 mag, 𝜎𝐴𝑉= 0.15 mag and\nattenuation limited to 0 < 𝐴𝑉< 7 mag, fixing the fraction of atten-\nuation arising from stellar birth clouds to 60%, with the remaining\n40% coming from the diffuse ISM (Chevallard et al. 2019). We also\nassume a log-prior on the velocity dispersion in the range 1 −1000\nkm s−1. Finally, we assume that the spectrum follows the PRISM\nresolution curve based on a point-source morphology, using the res-\nolution curve of an idealised point source generated with msafit, as\ndescribed in de Graaff et al. (2024b, Appendix A).\nWe carry out further bagpipes fits, varying only the assumed dust\nattenuation curve. We perform fits with the Milky Way dust curve,\nthe Salim dust law with 𝐵fixed as 0 (henceforth referred to as the\nflat Salim curve), allowing only the slope (𝛿) to deviate from the\nCalzetti curve, and the Li et al. (2008) analytical expression for the\ndust attenuation law, used in Markov et al. (2023, 2024). This dust\nparameterisation has the benefit of allowing SED fitting to be carried\nout without assuming the prior shape of the dust curve, but has the\ndisadvantage of having four free parameters, thus should only be used\nwith spectroscopic data, or photometric surveys with a sufficiently\nlarge number of photometric bands (Markov et al. 2023). We modify\nthe expression to allow for a variable width of the Drude profile\ncharacterising the UV bump, and as such the dust curve, normalised\nto the attenuation at 0.55𝜇m (𝐴𝑉), is given by\n𝐴𝜆/𝐴𝑉=\n𝑐1\n(𝜆/0.08)𝑐2 + (0.08/𝜆)𝑐2 + 𝑐3\n+ 233 [1 −𝑐1/(6.88𝑐2 + 0.145𝑐2 + 𝑐3) −𝑐4/𝑥]\n(𝜆/0.046)2 + (0.046/𝜆)2 + 90\n+\n𝑐4\n(𝜆/0.2175)2 + (0.2175/𝜆)2 +\n\u0002\n(𝑤/0.2175)2 −2\n\u0003 ,\n(2)\nwhere 𝑐1, 𝑐2, 𝑐3, 𝑐4 are dimensionless parameters, 𝜆is the wave-\nlength in 𝜇m, 𝑥= (6.55 +\n\u0002\n(𝑤/0.2175)2 −2\n\u0003\n), and 𝑤is the width\nof the UV bump in 𝜇m. The three terms of equation (2) describe the\nfar-ultraviolet (FUV) rise, the optical and near-infrared (NIR) atten-\nuation, and the 2175Å UV bump. We use priors for 𝑐1 −𝑐4 adapted\nfrom those given in Markov et al. (2024), requiring 𝑐4 ≥0, and set\n𝑤= 0.0250𝜇m. We present the best-fit values obtained with each\ndust curve, along with 1𝜎errors in Table 2. The posterior spectra\nand dust curves are shown in Figure 3. We show the full posterior\nspectra with residuals in Figure B1.\nWe find that fitting the photometry or spectrum alone recovers\nsimilar parameters for the UV bump (see Figure B2).\n3.6 Morphology\nWe perform surface brightness fitting with galfit version 3.0.5 (Peng\net al. 2002, 2010) to investigate the morphology of our source. galfit\nconvolves the galaxy surface brightness profile with a point spread\nfunction (PSF), and uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to min-\nimise the 𝜒2 of the fit.\nWe create PSF matched images using aperpy 2 (Weaver et al.\n2024), which creates empirical PSFs and makes use of pypher (Bou-\ncaud et al. 2016) to create PSF matched kernels. We create a PSF\nmatched stack of the filters in the short wavelength (SW) channel\nwhere the source is detected (F115W, F150W, F200W) to determine\nthe components required for fitting.\n2 aperpy is available though Github (https://github.com/astrowhit/\naperpy) and Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8280270).\nMNRAS 000, 1–16 (2025)\n\n\n6\nK.

Spectrum of GNWY-7379420231 (grey solid line) with a power-law fit to the UV continuum (red solid line). The dark red shading represents the UV\nslope fitting windows. The zoom in panel of the region around 2175Å shows the running median, indicated by a solid black line. This represents the attenuated\nstellar continuum, and shows a localised absorption feature. The Drude profile fit is shown by the solid blue line, within the fitting window indicated by the\nvertical dashed lines. The hatched region shows the location of the Ciii doublet. The bottom right panel shows the residuals of the power-law fit (PL) and\nthe combined power-law and Drude profile fit (PL+Drude). The power-law fit alone has a 7.0𝜎negative flux excess, with the PL+Drude model showing a\nsignificantly better fit, as supported by the BIC values.\nWe fit the source using two Sérsic components and a point source.\nThe Sérsic profile has the form\n𝐼(𝑅) = 𝐼𝑒exp\n(\n−𝑏𝑛\n\"\u0012 𝑅\n𝑅𝑒\n\u00131/𝑛\n−1\n#)\n,\n(3)\nwhere 𝐼(𝑅) is the intensity at a distance 𝑅from the centre of the\ngalaxy, 𝑅𝑒is the half-light radius of galaxy, 𝐼𝑒is the intensity at\nthe half-light radius, 𝑛is the Sérsic index (Sérsic 1963; Ciotti 1991;\nCaon et al. 1993), and 𝑏𝑛can be approximated as 𝑏𝑛≈2𝑛−1\n3 +\n4\n405𝑛+\n46\n25515𝑛2 (Ciotti & Bertin 1999). We allow 𝑅𝑒, magnitude, axis\nratio (𝑏/𝑎) and position angle to vary freely, allow the Sérsic index\nto vary between 0 < 𝑛< 10, and allow the source position to vary\nwithin ±3 pixels of the input location in both the 𝑥and 𝑦direction.\nWe find that one component has a very low Sérsic index, which we\nfix as 𝑛= 0.2. The best-fit model for the SW stack is shown in\nFigure 4. We then fit each band individually, keeping all parameters\nfixed to the best-fit values while allowing only the magnitude to vary.\nThe best-fit models are shown in Figure C1, where the point source\ncomponent is particularly visible in the SW channels.\nThe best-fit model is made up of a main, brighter component\n(Sérsic 1), with a ‘tail’, made up of the secondary Sérsic component\n(Sérsic 2) and a point source. The bright region (Sérsic 1) is best-fit\nby a Sérsic profile with 𝑛= 6.04 ± 2.27, and has a half-light radius\nof 𝑅𝑒= 569 ± 170 pc. The fainter Sérsic component (Sérsic 2) is the\ncomponent that is fit with a fixed Sérsic index of 𝑛= 0.20, and has a\nhalf-light radius of 𝑅𝑒= 648±80 pc. Errors are the 1𝜎uncertainties\nderived by galfit.\nWe carry out photometric SED fitting for each of these three\ncomponents, with the magnitudes obtained from the galfit fit in\neach band. As in Section 3.5, we use bpass v2.2.1 models with the\ndefault bpass IMF. We keep the redshift of the source fixed and use a\n‘bursty continuity’ model of star formation history, with bins of 0−3\nMyr, 3−10 Myr, 10−30 Myr and 30−𝑡(𝑧= 20) Myr. The ionisation\nparameter and metallicity are fixed to the best fit values obtained with\nthe Salim dust law in Section 3.5. We use the Salim dust law where\nthe prior on 𝐵is a truncated Gaussian prior with 𝜇𝐵= 0, 𝜎𝐵= 2,\nand 0 < 𝐵< 10. The best-fit spectra and photometry are shown in\nFigure 5, along with the posterior SFHs.\nFinally, we use statmorph (Rodriguez-Gomez et al. 2019) to\nmeasure the Gini-𝑀20 statistics, which can be used to quantify galaxy\nmorphology (Lotz et al. 2004, 2008). The Gini coefficient (𝐺) is a\nstatistic that is commonly used in economics to measure wealth\ndistribution in human populations, but was first used by Abraham\net al. (2003) to provide a quantitative measure of the distribution of\nlight within a galaxy. 𝐺is determined from the distribution of the\nabsolute flux values:\n𝐺=\n1\n|𝑋|𝑛(𝑛−1)\n𝑛\n∑︁\n𝑖\n(2𝑖−𝑛−1) |𝑋𝑖| ,\n(4)\nwhere |𝑋| is the mean of the absolute values |𝑋𝑖| (Lotz et al. 2004;\nRodriguez-Gomez et al. 2019). The 𝑀20 statistic is defined as the\nMNRAS 000, 1–16 (2025)\n\n\nThe 2175Å UV Bump in the EoR\n7\n10000\n15000\n20000\n25000\n30000\nObserved Wavelength (˚A)\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1.25\n1.50\n1.75\n2.00\nFν (10−30 erg s−1 cm−2 Hz−1)\nPRISM Spectrum\nRunning Median\nMW\nSalim\nFlat\nLi\nNIRCam Photometry\nbagpipes Photometry\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\nRest-frame Wavelength (˚A)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nAλ/AV\nCalzetti\nSMC\nMW\nThis work (Flat)\nThis work (Li)\nThis work (Salim)\nFigure 3.

Ormerod et al.\net al. 2004, 2008). We show the location of GNWY-7379420231 on\nthe Gini-𝑀20 parameter space in Figure C2, adopting the classifica-\ntions from Lotz et al. (2008). Gini and 𝑀20 can be used to determine\nwhether a galaxy is a merger, if the following criterion is met:\n𝐺> −0.14𝑀20 + 0.33.\n(7)\nBased on these diagnostics, GNWY-7379420231 falls within the\nmerger region of the parameter space. The stellar mass ratio of 12:1\nbetween Sérsic 1 and the two other components, derived from bag-\npipes spectral fitting, classifies this system as a minor merger. We\nalso see evidence for a minor merger in the G395H 2D spectrum of\nthe [Oiii] doublet, with a velocity offset of ∼180 kms−1, shown in\nFigure C3.\n3.7 Resolved SED Fitting\nWe create PSF matched images following the same method used in\nSection 3.6. We choose to match to the F444W mosaic as this has the\nbroadest PSF of our filters. We create an inverse variance weighted\nstacked image of our source and use vorbin (Cappellari & Copin\n2003) to perform adaptive spatial noise binning to create bins with\na target signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 25. We extract photometry\nin each NIRCam filter for each bin, and model the SED of each bin\nusing bagpipes.\nWe apply the same bagpipes fitting procedure described in Section\n3.6. We again adopt the Salim dust law with a truncated Gaussian\nprior on 𝐵(𝜇𝐵= 0, 𝜎𝐵= 2, 0 < 𝐵< 10) to allow us to trace the\nlocation of the UV bump. Using the 50th percentile of the posterior\nbagpipes distributions, we create 2D maps of the physical properties\nof our source, as shown in Figure 6. We measure the [Oiii]+H𝛽\nrest-frame equivalent width from the 50th percentile of the posterior\nspectrum generated in the fitting process, and measure the UV 𝛽\nslopes using the same fitting windows as in Section 3.2.\n3.8 Emission Line Measurements\nWe perform emission line fitting that accounts for both the line spread\nfunction (LSF) broadening and its undersampling by the NIRSpec\ndetectors. It is important that this is accounted for, as fitting a Gaus-\nsian to an undersampled line could severely over or underestimate the\nline flux (de Graaff et al. 2024a). To address this, we create Gaussian\nmodels on an oversampled grid and convolve them with the LSF of\nan idealised point source from de Graaff et al. (2024b). We use the\nmultinest nested sampling algorithm to fit the emission lines in both\nthe PRISM and G395H spectra.\nWe fit the following emission lines in the PRISM spectrum:\n[Oii]𝜆3727, [Oii]𝜆3729, H𝛽, [Oiii]𝜆4959 and [Oiii]𝜆5007. Due\nto the resolution of the PRISM spectrum, we fit the blended\n[Oii]𝜆3727+ [Oii]𝜆3729 emission lines as a single Gaussian. To re-\nduce the number of free parameters, we fix the central wavelength of\neach Gaussian profile, and fix the flux ratio of the [Oiii]𝜆𝜆4959, 5007\ndoublet to the theoretical value of 2.98. Finally, we correct for dust\nattenuation with the Cardelli et al. (1989) curve.\nThe dust corrected emission line fluxes are reported in Table D1 as\nthe median of the posterior flux distribution, with errors given as the\nsemi-difference of the 16th-84th percentiles of the posterior distri-\nbution. Using these emission lines, we derive the oxygen abundance\n(12 + log(O/H)) from a range of emission line ratios:\nR2 = log\n\u0012 [Oii]𝜆𝜆3727, 3729\nH𝛽\n\u0013\n(8)\nO32 = log\n\u0012\n[Oiii]𝜆5007\n[Oii]𝜆𝜆3727, 3729\n\u0013\n(9)\nR3 = log\n\u0012 [Oiii]𝜆5007\nH𝛽\n\u0013\n(10)\nR23 = log\n\u0012 [Oii]𝜆𝜆3727, 3729 + [Oiii]𝜆𝜆4959, 5007\nH𝛽\n\u0013\n(11)\nˆ𝑅= 0.47 × R2 + 0.88 × R3.\n(12)\nFigure 7 shows the dust corrected O32 and R23 emission line\nratios. The dust corrected emission line ratios are reported in\nfull in Table 1, along with the rest-frame equivalent width of the\n[Oiii]𝜆𝜆4959, 5007 doublet and H𝛽line. We combine the informa-\ntion from the emission line ratios and use the calibrations from Curti\net al. (2024b) to calculate the gas-phase metallicity (𝑍neb) in units of\nsolar metallicity (𝑍⊙), which is given in Table 1.\nUsing the\n𝑅\n∼\n2700 G395H grating, we measure the\n[Oii]𝜆𝜆3727,3729 and [Oiii]𝜆𝜆4959,5007 emission lines. We first\nmeasure the [Oiii] doublet with tied line widths. We use the median\nwidth of the posterior distribution as a fixed width when fitting the\n[Oii] doublet, where we also keep the central wavelengths fixed. The\n[Oii] fit is shown in Figure D1.\n3.9 Electron Density Measurement\nElectron densities in Hii regions are crucial for characterising the\nISM, as along with ISM pressure, they govern the emission from Hii\nregions (e.g. Kewley et al. 2019b; Isobe et al. 2023; Abdurro’uf et al.\n2024). To derive the electron density, we utilise the density-sensitive\n[Oii]𝜆3726,𝜆𝜆3729 emission line ratio (Kewley et al. 2019a), mea-\nsured from the G395H grating.\nWe then use pyneb (Luridiana et al. 2015) to determine 𝑛𝑒from the\n[Oii] line ratio, assuming an electron temperature of 𝑇𝑒= 10000K.\nFrom this, we obtain a value of log10(𝑛𝑒) cm−1 = 3.12+0.83\n−0.47, in\nagreement with the median value determined in Isobe et al. (2023)\nfor 𝑧∼7 −9 galaxies.\n3.10 Dynamical Mass\nWe follow the method described in Kohandel et al. (2019) to estimate\nthe dynamical mass of our source, which we summarise here. As-\nsuming a rotating disk geometry with radius 𝑅, the dynamical mass\ncan be estimated as\n𝑀dyn = 𝑣2𝑐𝑅\n𝐺,\n(13)\nwhere 𝑣𝑐can be estimated from the FWHM of the [Oiii]𝜆5007\nemission line using\nFWHM = 𝛾𝑣𝑐sin𝜃,\n(14)\nwhere 𝛾is a factor dependent on geometry, line profile, and turbu-\nlence. As in Capak et al. (2015), we estimate 𝛾= 1.32 and addi-\ntionally include a systematic error on 𝛾of 20%. We determine the\ninclination (𝜃) from the axis ratio of Sérsic 1 measured in Section\n3.6 using the Hubble (1926) equation\ncos2(𝜃) =\n(𝑏/𝑎)2 −(𝑏/𝑎)2\nmin\n1 −(𝑏/𝑎)2\nmin\n,\n(15)\nMNRAS 000, 1–16 (2025)\n\n\nThe 2175Å UV Bump in the EoR\n9\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\nRest-frame Wavelength (˚A)\n10000\n20000\n30000\n40000\n50000\nObserved Wavelength (˚A)\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\nAB Magnitude\ngalfit Photometry\nbagpipes Photometry\ngalfit Photometry\nbagpipes Photometry\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16 1820\nRedshift (z)\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\nAge of Universe (Gyr)\n0\n2\n4\nSFR (M⊙yr−1)\nS´ersic 1 - Main source\nlog10(M⋆/M⊙) = 8.37+0.08\n−0.11\nAV = 0.18+0.09\n−0.08 mag\nt⋆= 252+20\n−46 Myr\nSFR10 = 2.21+1.14\n−0.57 M⊙yr−1\nS´ersic 2 - Tail\nlog10(M⋆/M⊙) = 7.08+0.05\n−0.06\nAV = 0.29+0.07\n−0.08 mag\nt⋆= 3+15\n−1\nMyr\nSFR10 = 1.18+0.14\n−0.14 M⊙yr−1\nPoint source - Tail\nlog10(M⋆/M⊙) = 6.84+0.43\n−0.25\nAV = 0.31+0.08\n−0.06 mag\nt⋆= 56+169\n−53\nMyr\nSFR10 = 0.41+0.15\n−0.08 M⊙yr−1\nFigure 5.

From the integrated PRISM spectrum of our\nsource, we measure a high [Oiii]+H𝛽rest-frame equivalent width\nof 1300 ± 210Å, placing GNWY-7379420231 within the extreme\nemission line galaxy (EELG) regime (e.g., Boyett et al. 2024). The\n[Oiii]+H𝛽emission is a tracer of ongoing star formation, indicating\nthe presence of a young stellar population. This is in agreement with\nthe inferred mass-weighted ages (22 −59 Myr) from the combined\nspectro-photometric SED fitting, when a UV bump is included in the\nattenuation curve (see Table 2). We also measure the dust-corrected\nemission line ratios O32 and R23, which are shown in Figure 7. Our\nsource falls within the red shaded region defined in Witten et al.\n(2025), which indicates the region in the log10(O32) −log10(R23)\nparameter space that may be populated by galaxies containing an\nolder stellar population. However, in galaxies with strong emission\nlines, the light from recent starbursts can dominate that of older stel-\nlar populations in an effect known as ‘outshining’ (Narayanan et al.\n2024b). Due to the presence of extreme emission lines in the inte-\ngrated spectrum, we investigate whether an older stellar population\nis present through both resolved SED fitting in Voronoi bins, and the\nSED fitting of the galfit components.\nThrough morphological analysis we are able to separate the source\ninto three components: the main component (Sérsic 1) which contains\nthe bulk of the stellar mass, and a tail made up of a second Sérsic\ncomponent (Sérsic 2) and a point source. The inferred mass-weighted\nages from the SED fitting of these components suggests that the\nmain component is significantly older, with 𝑡★∼252 Myr for the\nmain component, compared to 𝑡★∼56 Myr and 𝑡★∼3 Myr for\nthe components within the tail. This indicates that an older stellar\npopulation is indeed present within GNWY-7379420231, despite\nthe extreme emission lines dominating the integrated spectrum. The\nbest-fit posterior spectra are shown in Figure 5, with the UV bump\nfeature strongest in the point source component of the tail.\nWe show maps of the physical properties inferred from the re-\nsolved SED fitting in Figure 6, and UV continuum slopes measured\nfrom the median bagpipes posterior spectra. The overlaid contours\nfrom the SW stack show the clumpy nature of the galaxy, with a\nmain component and an extended tail-like feature. Although clumpy\nmorphologies are common within the EoR (Chen et al. 2024), the dis-\nsimilar star formation histories of each component suggest that this\nmay be a merger system (e.g., Hsiao et al. 2023). Furthermore, this\nhypothesis is supported by the detection of a tail-like feature (e.g. Ren\net al. 2020). The regions with the highest [Oiii]+H𝛽EWs (> 2500Å)\nare concentrated within the area where the tail and main compo-\nnent are merging, indicating that the starburst is merger-induced.\nThe mass-weighted ages inferred by the SED fitting for this region of\nextreme line emission are very young (≲20 Myr), further supporting\nthe idea of a recent burst of star formation. The stellar mass surface\ndensity (Σ★) map shows that the bulk of the stellar mass is concen-\ntrated within the main component of the source. This could suggest\nthe presence of an older stellar population in this region where stellar\nmass has built up over time. Although the Σ★and star formation rate\nsurface density (ΣSFR10) overlap significantly, there is a slight offset\nbetween the well localised peaks of the ΣSFR10 and Σ★, with the peak\nΣSFR10 slightly closer to the merger region. Through the maps of the\nUV slope and 𝐴𝑉, we can see that the dust attenuation is patchy, with\nsome significantly dustier sightlines present. The location of these\ndustier sightlines suggests that there is significant dust build up lo-\ncalised to the merger region. The bump strength (𝐵) parameter from\nthe Salim dust curve is a measure of the additional dust attenuation\nat 2175Å and peaks where the tail and main component are merging,\nwithin the region of extreme line emission where a recent burst of\nstar formation took place. Note that we aim to be conservative in our\nresolved bump fitting by adding a prior on 𝐵centred on 𝐵= 0 (see\nSections 3.6 and 3.7). While our photometric analysis provides an\ninitial insight into this spatial distribution, we note that observations\nwith the NIRSpec IFU would be valuable to explore these findings\nin greater detail.\nThere are two possible scenarios which may give rise to the vis-\nibility of the UV bump in the tail region of our galaxy. Firstly, an\nolder stellar population may have enriched this region over time. The\ntotal stellar mass formed > 300 Myr ago within the main Sérsic\ncomponent (Sérsic 1) is log10(𝑀★/𝑀⊙) = 7.96+0.12\n−0.21. It is possible\nthat AGB stars from this epoch could have contributed to the build\nup of carbonaceous dust grains, thus contributing to the presence of\nthe UV bump feature. In this case, the likely merger would illumi-\nnate existing dust. Alternatively, the merger-induced starburst could\nhave processed early-formed dust, breaking down larger dust grains\nformed in SNe, into smaller carbonaceous particles responsible for\nthe UV bump (see Section 4.4).\nWe explore the ISM properties of GNWY-7379420231 with the\nhigh-resolution G395H spectrum, dominated by emission from the\nmerger region of the galaxy, which we use to estimate the electron\ndensity. While the obtained value is high compared to estimates\nbased on the O32 emission line ratio (Reddy et al. 2023), and ele-\nvated compared to galaxies at lower redshift (e.g. 𝑛𝑒∼100cm−3,\nKaasinen et al. 2017), it is in agreement with the values obtained for\ngalaxies at a similar redshift in Isobe et al. (2023). The high electron\ndensity (log10(𝑛𝑒) cm−1 = 3.12+0.83\n−0.47) may be connected with gas\ncompression as a result of the merger, potentially inducing the recent\nburst of star formation. Finally, we estimate the dynamical mass of\nour galaxy, finding a stellar mass fraction of around ∼18%, suggest-\ning a gas dominated system. The gas supplied by the merger would\nbe required to fuel the strong burst of star formation. However, it\nmust be noted that dynamical masses may be under or overestimated\nin case of a merger (Kohandel et al. 2019; de Graaff et al. 2024b).\nFinally, GNWY-7379420231 is kinematically coincident with two\noverdensities (JADES-GN-OD-7.133, JADES-GN-OD-7.144) iden-\ntified in Helton et al. (2024), which reside in a complex environment\nwith connected filamentary structures. Furthermore, there is evi-\ndence of accelerated galaxy evolution in protocluster environments\n(Morishita et al. 2024), suggesting that the large scale environment\nin which GNWY-7379420231 resides could influence its evolution,\ncontributing to rapid dust formation.\nMNRAS 000, 1–16 (2025)\n\n\nThe 2175Å UV Bump in the EoR\n11\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1.25\n1.50\nlog10(R23)\n−0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nlog10(O32)\nHeintz+24 (z > 7)\nYang+17b Blueberries\nYang+17a Green Peas\nCameron+23\nWitten+24\nThis work\nFigure 7.

The red shading shows the region log10 O32 < 0.7\nand log10 R23 > 0.9 which may contain galaxies hosting an older stellar\npopulation (Witten et al. 2025).\n4.2 Dust Attenuation Curves\nThe dust attenuation curve assumed during SED fitting can introduce\nsystematic biases, with properties such as stellar mass, SFR, and 𝐴𝑉\nvarying significantly (Kriek & Conroy 2013; Salim & Narayanan\n2020). Previous studies have shown that stellar masses and SFRs\nmay vary by up to 0.16 dex and 0.3 dex, respectively (Reddy et al.\n2015; Narayanan et al. 2018; Tress et al. 2018; Shivaei et al. 2020),\nindicating that care must be taken when carrying out SED fitting. In\nthis section, we explore the impact of four different dust attenuation\ncurves, three of which incorporate a UV bump.\nWe find that the inferred metallicity (𝑍★) and ionisation parameter\n(log10𝑈) are consistent regardless of the dust law assumed during\nSED fitting, in agreement with Markov et al. (2023). While the\nmedian mass-weighted age, 𝑡★, varies from 22 −166 Myr, the large\nuncertainties associated with these inferred values have large overlap,\nsuggesting the ages are broadly consistent regardless of the assumed\ndust law. However, we find that the stellar mass, log10 (𝑀★/𝑀⊙),\ndoes vary depending on the assumed dust law. Adopting the flat\nSalim dust law gives rise to a higher stellar mass (log10 (𝑀∗/𝑀⊙) =\n8.84+0.13\n−0.15, compared to log10 (𝑀∗/𝑀⊙) = 8.60+0.15\n−0.13 when assuming\nthe standard Salim dust law). This contrasts with the consistent values\ninferred when adopting a dust curve which exhibits a UV bump.\nThe SFRs and V-band dust attenuation also vary, with the use of\nthe Li parameterisation resulting in higher inferred values for both\nquantities.\nThe dust attenuation curves obtained from the bagpipes fitting are\nshown in Figure 3, along with the commonly used Calzetti, MW,\nand SMC curves. We find that the dust curve obtained using the\nSalim et al. (2018) curve is similar to the MW dust curve within 1𝜎\nerrors, with a strong UV bump at 2175Å, with a bump strength of\n𝐵= 4.08+1.42\n1.08 and a power-law modification of 𝛿= −0.11+0.13\n−0.16. The\ndust curve obtained with the Li parameterisation most resembles the\nshape of the MW curve with the presence of the UV bump, compared\nto other curves such as the Calzetti and SMC curves.

We measure a central\nwavelength of 𝜆max = 2257+26\n−28Å, similar to the 𝜆max = 2263+20\n−24Å\nmeasured in Witstok et al. (2023). This is ∼2.9𝜎higher than the\nMNRAS 000, 1–16 (2025)\n\n\n12\nK. Ormerod et al.\npeak wavelength seen in the MW curve, and may be caused by dust\ngrains with larger molecular size (Blasberger et al. 2017; Li et al.\n2024; Lin et al. 2025).\nWe measure a bump amplitude (strength) of 𝐴𝜆,max = 0.46+0.06\n−0.07\nmag, which we plot against cosmic time in Figure 8, along with other\nhigh redshift detections (Witstok et al. 2023; Markov et al. 2023),\n𝑧∼2 stacks (Shivaei et al. 2022; Noll et al. 2009), and the MW, LMC\nand SMC extinction curves (Fitzpatrick & Massa 1986; Gordon et al.\n2003). While the bump amplitudes in this work and Shivaei et al.\n(2022); Witstok et al. (2023) are measured in the same way, we must\nconvert the other literature points to a consistent definition of 𝐴𝜆,max.\nWe first convert the MW, LMC and SMC curves using the Fitzpatrick\n& Massa (1986) definition 𝐴𝜆,max = 𝑐3/𝛾2𝐸(𝐵−𝑉), where we vary\n𝐸(𝐵−𝑉) = 𝐴𝑉/𝑅𝑉over a range 0.1 mag < 𝐴𝑉< 0.5 mag.\nWe convert the Noll et al. (2009) values in the same way, with the\nmeasured values of 𝐸(𝐵−𝑉). We convert the Markov et al. (2023)\nvalue by measuring the excess attenuation using their quoted values of\n𝑐1 to 𝑐4 and the Li et al. (2008) dust attenuation expression as defined\nin their Equation 6, compared to the baseline attenuation determined\nby setting 𝑐4 = 0. Finally, we download the spectra of the two sources\nidentified in Markov et al. (2024) with a bump detection from the\nDAWN JWST Archive (DJA; Heintz et al. 2024b), which are reduced\nwith msaexp (Brammer 2023; de Graaff et al. 2024a) to measure the\nbump strength and central wavelength, following the same procedure\nas in Section 2. We measure bump amplitudes for 2750_449 and\n1433_3989 of 𝐴𝜆,max = 0.44+0.07\n−0.08 mag and 𝐴𝜆,max = 0.32 ± 0.07\nmag, respectively.\nIt is expected that the strength of the UV bump decreases towards\nhigher redshift (Markov et al. 2024), however the bump amplitude\nmeasured in this work is high and in contrast to this expected trend.\nInterestingly, it is similar to the 𝑧∼6.7 detection in Witstok et al.\n(2023) and values we measure for the two galaxies from Markov\net al. (2024). Combined with the increased peak wavelength of the\nbump feature in GNWY-7379420231, this suggests that the grain\ncomposition may differ compared to that at lower redshift, or these\nyoung galaxies could have a simpler dust-star geometry, as it is\nexpected that the galaxies with the most complex young geometries\nhave weaker bump strengths (Narayanan et al. 2018).\n4.4 Dust Production in the Early Universe\nThe detection of the 2175Å UV bump in GNWY-7379420231 pro-\nvides important constraints on its dust properties and evolution. The\nUV bump is predominantly seen in metal-rich galaxies at 𝑧≲3\n(e.g., Elíasdóttir et al. 2009; Noll et al. 2009; Shivaei et al. 2022),\nsuggesting it is commonly found in evolved systems. We find that\nour source is metal-enriched compared to galaxies of a similar mass\n(Curti et al. 2024a), with 𝑍neb ∼0.28𝑍⊙. The dust evolution within\ngalaxies depends strongly on the age and metallicity of the system,\nwith dust production in low metallicity systems controlled by stel-\nlar sources (AGB stars and SNe II). When the metallicity exceeds a\ncritical metallicity (𝑍cr), dust mass growth becomes dominated by\nmetal accretion onto existing dust grains within the ISM, and dust\nmass increases rapidly. This transition may occur at 10 −20% solar\nmetallicity (e.g. Asano et al. 2013; Rémy-Ruyer et al. 2014, 2015; Li\net al. 2019; Roman-Duval et al. 2022). The metallicity of our system\nsuggests that it has entered the regime of efficient ISM dust mass\nbuild up.\nFrom our SED fitting analysis of the integrated spectrum when\nadopting the Li dust model, we infer the presence of a very young\nstellar population, with 𝑡★∼22 Myr. If we were to rely solely on\nthe stellar age inferred from the integrated spectrum in isolation, we\nmust consider alternative dust production pathways, given that AGB\nstars capable of producing carbonaceous dust require a ∼300 Myr\ntimescale to evolve off the main sequence.\nA potential mechanism is through Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, formed\nwhen massive stars with initial masses > 30 𝑀⊙lose their hydrogen\nenvelope. Carbon sequence WR stars (WC stars) are known to pro-\nduce dust, including PAHs (Lau et al. 2022), although they may need\nto be in a binary system where the companion has a high mass-loss\nrate (e.g., Cherchneff et al. 2000; Lau et al. 2021; Peatt et al. 2023;\nSchneider & Maiolino 2024). However, their contribution may be\nlimited: just 27 ± 9% of WC stars display circumstellar dust within\nthe Milky Way (Rosslowe & Crowther 2015), and WR stars are rare\n(Eldridge et al. 2017), with few WC stars found in low metallicity\nenvironments (Massey 2003). Nonetheless, the large 0.1 −1.0𝜇m\ngrains produced would be more robust to destruction from the sub-\nsequent SN shocks, and have grain lifetimes ∼3 times greater than\n100Å sized grains (Jones et al. 1996). PAHs are also known to be\nhighly stable due to their honeycomb structure (Allamandola et al.\n1989; Tielens 2008; Lau et al. 2022).\nAlternatively, early dust production could be dominated by SNe\nunless the reverse shock is very significant, even more so if the IMF is\ntop-heavy (Schneider & Maiolino 2024, and references therein). Type\nII supernovae produce dust primarily made up of silicates, amorphous\ncarbon, magnetite, and corundum (Todini & Ferrara 2001), which can\nbe processed into PAHs. Amorphous carbon ejected into the ISM\ncan react with hydrogen to form hydrogenated amorphous carbons\n(HACs), which can then form PAHs through shattering due to grain-\ngrain collisions (Jones et al. 1996). Additionally, photoprocessing\nby UV radiation can lead to the formation of aromatic bonds, with\nlarger carbonaceous particles acting as a reservoir for the formation\nof smaller particles (Duley et al. 2015). Furthermore, graphitic grains\nwith isotopic compositions that suggest an origin in SNe have been\nidentified, most consistent with an origin in Type II SNe (e.g., Zinner\n1998; Nittler & Ciesla 2016). While the SNe reverse shock may\npreferentially destroy smaller grains (Nozawa et al. 2007), Jones\net al. (1996) suggests that as much as 5−15% of the starting graphite\ngrain mass may end up in < 14Å graphitic fragments, potentially\nforming PAHs through hydrogenation.\nHowever, morphological analysis of our source reveals a more\ncomplex system than initially suggested by the integrated spectrum.\nWhen we examine the source as a three-component system, we find\nevidence for an older stellar population masked by outshining effects,\na particular problem when coverage is limited to the rest-frame UV\nand optical (Giménez-Arteaga et al. 2024). This older stellar popu-\nlation is concentrated within Sérsic 1, the most massive of the three\ncomponents, with a mass-weighted age of 𝑡★= 252+20\n−46 Myr. While\nstars across a broader mass range (0.8-8𝑀⊙) can enter the AGB, car-\nbon grains are mostly produced in AGB stars within the mass range\n2𝑀⊙< 𝑚star < 3 −3.5𝑀⊙(Schneider & Maiolino 2024). Crucially,\nthis component shows substantial stellar mass build up at ages > 300\nMyr, where stars ∼3𝑀⊙enter the AGB. This could provide sufficient\ntime for AGB driven dust production to pre-enrich the ISM before\nthe merger event, although their evolution is less well understood in\nlow-metallicity environments (e.g., Herwig 2005).\nRecent galaxy evolution simulations (Narayanan et al. 2023,\n2024a) suggest that PAH formation is enhanced in environments with\nhigh velocity dispersions (highly turbulent gas) and strong radiation\nfields. Increased shattering rates are driven by these large ISM ve-\nlocity dispersions in galaxies with high sSFRs, resulting in increased\nfeedback energy per unit mass, driving up the fraction of ultrasmall\ngrains. Furthermore, elevated global SFRs can drive aromatisation\nby UV radiation (Narayanan et al. 2023). These theoretical predic-\nMNRAS 000, 1–16 (2025)\n\n\nThe 2175Å UV Bump in the EoR\n13\ntions align with our observations of GNWY-7379420231, where the\nUV bump is localised to the merger region characterised by extreme\n[Oiii]+H𝛽equivalent widths and sSFRs. This spatial alignment, com-\nbined with the evidence for an older stellar population in the main\ncomponent, suggests that the intense UV radiation and turbulence in\nthe merger region may be driving localised PAH formation through\nboth top-down shattering, as well as increased dust growth on small\ngrains within the turbulent ISM (Narayanan et al. 2024a).\n5 SUMMARY\nIn this paper, we have presented the analysis of JWST/NIRSpec obser-\nvations, revealing one of the most distant known galaxies exhibiting\na very strong 2175Å UV bump feature at 𝑧= 7.11 when the universe\nwas only ∼700 Myr old. We have presented a detailed analysis of the\ndust properties and stellar populations within GNWY-7379420231,\nfinding evidence for both intense ongoing star formation and an older\nstellar population, suggesting a complex dust production history. The\nspatial correlation between the UV bump and the recent burst of star\nformation, combined with the system likely being a merger, provides\nnew insights into high redshift dust evolution. Our main findings are\nsummarised as follows:\n• We find a strong UV bump with 𝐴𝜆, max = 0.46+0.06\n−0.07 mag in a\ngalaxy at 𝑧= 7.11. The peak wavelength of the UV bump is shifted by\n84Å (at 2.9𝜎significance) compared to that of the bump seen in the\nMW curve, which may suggest a different dust grain size distribution\nat high redshift.\n• While the integrated spectrum suggests a young stellar popula-\ntion with 𝑡★∼22 Myr, morphological analysis reveals the presence\nof an older stellar population in the most massive component with\nsignificant stellar mass with age > 300 Myr, potentially resolving the\napparent tension in dust production timescales.\n• Through resolved SED fitting, we determine that the UV bump is\nspatially correlated with the merger region, characterised by extreme\n[Oiii]+H𝛽equivalent widths, suggesting enhanced PAH formation\nin a turbulent environment with intense UV radiation.\n• We find that our galaxy is metal enriched compared to galax-\nies of a similar mass, which could indicate rapid dust mass build\nup through dust grain growth mechanisms. The presence of metal\nenrichment could indicate that grain growth has reached an efficient\ngrowth regime, with the metal enrichment resulting from the under-\nlying older stellar population.\nIn summary, we are able to provide new insights into potential dust\nformation and processing pathways at high redshift, suggesting that\nthe ISM was pre-enriched by the older stellar population, before the\ndust was processed into PAHs through turbulence and UV radiation\nwithin the merger region. The capabilities of JWST will allow us\nto probe dust production in the early universe in more depth, fur-\nther constraining the early methods of dust production. Finding more\ngalaxies which exhibit a UV bump, and building up a sample within\nthe EoR will allow us to gain an understanding of the production\nmechanisms, the dust composition, and enable us to probe star for-\nmation and chemical evolution within the first billion years of cosmic\ntime. Furthermore, upcoming sub-mm follow up will provide us with\nmulti-wavelength dust constraints, such as providing an estimate of\nthe dust-to-gas ratio of this source.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Adam Carnall and Thomas Harvey\nfor helpful conversations.

{"text": "Synthesizing Tabular Data Using\nSelectivity Enhanced Generative\nAdversarial Networks\n[25pt Research Project]\nby\nYouran Zhou\nSupervised by\nDr. Jianzhong Qi\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE\nFaculty of Science\nSchool of Mathematics and Statistics\nThis thesis submitted to the University of Melbourne for partial fulfillment of the\ndegree of\nMaster of Data Science\nMarch 2025\narXiv:2502.21034v1  [cs.LG]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE\nAbstract\nWhile the fast pace of economic development, E-commerce platforms face significant\nchallenges in handling excessive customer transactions during major online shopping\nevents like Black Friday. To be prepared for large volumes of transactions, those plat-\nforms need to utilize synthesized data to run stress tests and derive the computational\nresources needed to cope with such transactions. The synthesized data for such patterns\nare usually in the form of tables.\nGenerating Adversarial Networks (GAN) are used in most recent tabular data synthe-\nsizing studies and have shown impressive performance in generating tabular data while\nfulfilling privacy constraints and downstream machine learning model training needs.\nHowever, existing studies do not apply to the E-commerce stress testing scenarios di-\nrectly because the computational resources required to process the data generated by\nGAN have not been considered. A core concept in computational resource estimation\nfor database transaction processing is query selectivity. To the best of our knowledge,\nno study has been conducted on supporting selectivity constraints in the tabular data\nsynthesizing field.\nThis thesis considers query selectivity constraints in tabular data generation and offers\nsolutions by designing a novel method for tabular generation GAN models. We add\na pre-trained deep neural network component for an additional supervision signal to\nmodel the query selectivity constraint that maintains the selectivity consistency between\nground truth data and synthetic data. We implement our method on top of two GAN\nmodels and evaluate them with extensive experiments against the three state-of-the-art\nGAN models and a VAE model on five real-world datasets. The results show that the\nsynthetic data generated by our model resembles the real data, increasing the selectivity\nestimation accuracy by up to 20% and machine learning utilities by up to 6%.\nKeywords: GAN, data synthesis, tabular data, selectivity estimation\n\n\nDeclaration of Authorship\nI certify that this report does not incorporate without acknowledgement any material\npreviously submitted for a degree or diploma in any university; and that to the best\nof my knowledge and belief it does not contain any material previously published or\nwritten by another person where due reference is not made in the text.

2017, The Economist published a story titled, ‘The world’s most valuable re-\nsource is no longer oil, but data.’\nCompanies from a variety of industry fields gain\nvaluable insights from using internal and external data sources.\nThe desire of data\nraises the issue of data shortage. For instance, in the medical field, new technologies\nare utilizing patient health histories to create predictive models that can be used to\nimprove diagnosis and understanding of illness. Rare diseases are challenging to study\nsince we can only find a limited number of real-life datasets. In the E-commerce field,\nthe online shopping platforms face the challenge from gigantic amount of transaction\ndata during the major shopping events such as Black Friday, where a lack of computa-\ntion resources may result in a blockage of user transactions, thus negatively impacting\nthe revenue. They need a sufficient amount of data to do the stress testing to avoid\nsuch loss. As another example, scientists who work in the data science area are often\nfaced with the problem of insufficient data when they are trying to train new and robust\nmachine models.\nOn the other hand, big data often compromises privacy and results in unjustified anal-\nyses because of its immense knowledge. Some European governments implemented the\nEuropean General Data Protection Regulation in order to prevent misuse of data and\nviolations of privacy rights and to implement strict rules with respect to data protection\nin order to prevent privacy leaks. This poses a new challenge for the industries that are\ndriven by big data to find solutions that will allow them to make big discoveries while\nrespecting the privacy rights of individuals as well as mandatory government regulations.\nOne emerging solution is to rely on synthetic data rather than real data, which is statis-\ntically very close to real data and can satisfy privacy requirements due to its synthetic\nnature. However, there are some challenges for tabular data synthesizing tasks.\n1\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction\n2\nThe major issues can be summarized as follows:\n1. Data Shortage Issue: Generative models aim to produce sufficient outputs with\na wide variety. Due to the limited number of input data, it is hard to consider\nboth quantity and variety for synthetic data. Some models may suffer from mode\ncollapse problems, which means the model can not generate various data. Thus it\nkeeps generating the same output.\n2. Data Privacy Issue: Tabular data usually contains users’ sensitive information,\nwhich could be used to identify individuals and harm their privacy. The more\nsimilarity between synthetic data and real data indicates the better quality of\nsynthetic data. However, synthetic data with high similarity could reveal users’\ninformation. Therefore, the tabular data synthesizer should try to protect users’\ninformation and maintain the high generating quality.\n3. Data Quality Issue (Machine Learning Utility): Synthetic data are used for down-\nstream machine learning model training needs in specific applications. That re-\nquires high-quality synthetic data.\nThese high-quality data should satisfy the\nmachine learning utility to complete the downstream tasks.\nThat means if we\ntrain the machine learning model using the synthetic data, that should have a\nsimilar performance to the machine learning model trained by real data.\n4. Data Quality Issue (Database Constraint): Databases are commonly used to store\nand manage tabular data. Some database constraints define specific properties that\ndata in a database must comply with. The origin data define those properties. The\nsynthetic data with high quality should fulfil these constraints as well.\nGenerative Adversarial Network (GAN) [4] is one of the most promising approaches to\nsynthesize data. Initially, GAN was designed in the past to generate images. Now, it\nhas been migrated to produce tabular datasets as well [5] [6] [7] [8]. Normally, a GAN\nmodel is trained on a real dataset. Once it is constructed, it can be used to efficiently\ngenerate tabular data.\nFigure 1.1 shows the example of using GAN model to solves the issue 1 successfully.\nMost of the recent works pay considerable attention to the issue 2 and issue 3. TGAN [5]\nuses a reversible data transformer and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to pre-process\nthe categorical data, and numerical data further improves the ability to generate categor-\nical data and the distribution of numerical data. The state-of-the-art CTGAN [6] augments\nthe training procedure with mode-specific normalization and treats categorical variables\nas condition vectors and addresses data imbalance by employing a conditional generator.\nTableGAN-MCA [9] proposes a novel Membership Collision Attack against GANs, which\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction\n3\nFigure 1.1: Example of using GAN to solve the tabular data shortage problem\nallows an adversary given only synthetic entries randomly sampled from a black-box\ngenerator to recover partial GAN training data to immune Membership Inference at-\ntack. ITS-GAN [10] studies an incomplete table synthesis problem (using a very small\nproportion of real data to train GAN models) for tabular data augmentation. It used\npre-trained functional dependencies models to enhance the GAN model in order to en-\nsure the generated data satisfied the machine learning utility.\nAlthough current works yielding success on the first three issues, issue 4 has not been\nwell developed and solved.\n1.1\nProblem\nRecall the E-commerce problem: the online platforms need to conduct the stress test\nand use sufficient data to estimate the computational resources required during major\nshopping events.\nRequired computational resources can be formulated as the query\nexecution cost. The query cost occurs when we take any actions on a table from our\ndatabase.\nThe query execution cost is computed by combining the cost of each of\nthe operators appearing in the query plan. The standard operators include selection,\nprojection, joint and so on. However, calculating the actual cost of query plans is usually\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction\n4\nimpossible without actually executing the plan. The only method we could calculate the\nexecution cost is to estimate the cost of each operator separately and combine them.\nEquation 1.1 shows the idea of how to estimate the query execution cost.\nˆCQuery execution = ˆCSelection + ˆCProjection + ˆCJoint + · · ·\n(1.1)\nwhere ˆC indicates the estimated cost.\nDespite the current GAN models having made great successes, the existing methods\ncould not ensure their synthetic data fit the requirement for E-commerce platforms as\nthere is a research gap between the Issue 4 and current methods. Motivated by this\nproblem, we start from the selection cost and take a further step to selectivity.\nTo\nmaximize the accuracy of selectivity cost, we should let the generated data satisfy the\nselectivity constraints from the original data.\nThe problem can be stated as:\n‘How to develop a tabular data generation GAN to model selectivity constraints in\ntabular data synthesizing’\nMotivated by this question, this thesis conducts a series of studies on query selectivity\nconstraint modeling for GAN-based tabular data generation.\n1.2\nContributions and Thesis Outline\nIn this thesis, we design a GAN based tabular data synthesizer that fulfills query selec-\ntivity constraints. We propose a novel method to combine with state-of-the-art GAN\nmodels by introducing a pre-trained selectivity estimation deep neural network to pro-\nvide additional control of the selectivity of generated data. By modifying the loss term\nof the GAN model to ensure the generated data could fit the selectivity constraint. We\ncombined the method with two GAN models and tested on five widely used machine\nlearning datasets against three GAN-based tabular data generation methods and one\nVAE-based method.\nThe main contributions of our work can be summarized as following:\n• Improves the current data reversible transforming method to ensure the GAN\nmodel is suitable with any mixed-type data.\n• Pre-trains a selectivity estimation model.\nIncorporates the selectivity score in\ntraining the generator, thus the synthesizing data can fulfill the selectivity con-\nstraints.\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction\n5\n• The proposed augmentation method is flexible that could compatible any GAN\nbased tabular data synthesizer.\nThe rest of the chapters are organized below:\nIn Chapter 2, we will discuss common approaches of tabular data synthesizing methods\nand the selectivity estimation methods.\nIn Chapter 3, we will introduce pre-trained selectivity model, GAN model architecture\nand how to combine them together.\nIn Chapter 4, we will talk about the implementation, parameter setting and present\nsufficient experimental results.\nIn Chapter 5, we will gave a summary of the experiments, proposes the limitation of our\nmethod, and provides the future improvement direction.\n\n\nChapter 2\nRelated Work\nIn this chapter, we will introduce some background information regarding traditional\ngenerative models for tabular data generation, Bayesian networks in statistics, varia-\ntional autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) in computer\nscience.\nFurthermore, we will discuss the different approaches to selectivity estima-\ntion, which include traditional estimation models and novel regression-based estimation\nmodels.\n2.1\nTabular Data Generative models\nGenerative models are unsupervised machine learning models that attempt to discover\nthe regularities, patterns and distributions from the input origin data, then use the\nlearned knowledge to generate plausible data. The purpose of synthetic data generation\nis to resolve four issues, which are discussed in Chapter 1: data shortage issues, data\nprivacy issues, data quality issues, including Machine Learning and Data Base issues.\nThe models learn from the existing real data and generate their distributions from the\nacquired data, fulfilling requirements from the different industries and addressing the\nfour issues.\nStatistical generative models such as Bayesian networks and Gaussian mixture models\nare suitable for fitting certain probability distributions.\nHowever, in the real world,\nthe datasets are often more complex and come in different formats. As a result, the\nstatistical models are not usually compatible with image or text datasets.\n6\n\n\nChapter 2 Related Work\n7\n2.1.1\nBayesian network\nThe Bayesian network [11] model is widely studied in the field of statistical and machine\nlearning.\nAssume A is the set of attributes on the dataset D. D has a joint probability distri-\nbution over the cross-product of A’s attribute domains. A Bayesian network can be\nused to describe the distribution through the particular conditional independence be-\ntween the attributes of A. To be specific, a Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph\n(DAG) that represents each attribute in A as a node and conditional independence be-\ntween attributes using directed edges. A simple Bayesian network schematic is shown\nin Figure 2.1. Bayesian networks are simple but powerful graphical models. They can\napproximate the complete-dimensional data distribution by combining low-dimensional\ndata distributions.\nFigure 2.1: Bayesian network over five attributes from PrivBayes [1]\nThe standard Bayesian network generating synthetic data can be summarized as follow-\ning steps:\n1. Train a standard Bayesian network\n2. Compute the differential privacy distributions of the data and then inject the\nLaplace noise to each parameter of the learned Bayesian network\n3. Generate synthetic data from the noisy Bayesian network\nHowever, the inappropriate amount or content of noise would lead the Bayesian network\nto a very poor generation performance. The other limitation of the traditional Bayesian\nnetworks is that they cannot handle continuous data, but they can represent a joint\ndistribution of discrete variables.\n\n\nChapter 2 Related Work\n8\nPrivBayes\nPrivBayes [1] was developed by ZHANG et al. in 2017. A novel Bayesian Network-\nbased model provides a solution to protect differential privacy. The formal definition of\nε-differential privacy is as follows:\nPr[G(D1) = O] ≤eε · Pr[G(D2) = O]\nwhere Pr[ · ] is the probability of an event.\nPrivBayes uses traditional Bayesian network architecture but a differential privacy\nlearning algorithm to reduce the amount of noise that needs to be inserted.\nThey\ncompute a differential private Bayesian network that approximates the full-dimensional\ndistribution using the Laplace mechanism and the exponential mechanism. Before the\nmodel, it discretized all continuous variables into 16 equal-sized bins to make the model\nmore flexible for mixed-type datasets.\nThe PrivBayes can be constructed in to three stages:\n1. Using ε1-differential privacy method to build a k-degree Bayesian network N\nthrough the attributes in dataset D.\n2. Using ε2-differential privacy method to generate d, a set of conditional distributions\nfor D. For example, each pair of conditional distribution Pr[Xi|Πi] got a noisy\ndistribution Pr⋆[Xi|Πi].\n3. Use the Bayesian network N and the d noisy conditional distributions to derive an\nestimated distribution of the tuples in D, then sample tuples from the estimated\ndistribution to generate a synthetic dataset D⋆.\nIn phase 1, the choice of k is non-trivial. It involves a trade-off between the Bayesian\nnetwork’s original quality. A Bayesian network with a larger k keeps more information\nfrom the full-dimensional distribution Pr[A]. For instance, a (d −1) - degree Bayesian\nnetwork can fit the distribution. In contrast, if a 1 - degree Bayesian network is present,\nthere is much information loss when fitting the distribution. To resolve this problem,\nthey use a measure called θ - usefulness to provide a more choose k automatically to\nbalance the accuracy of the Bayesian network. Through the constraint of θ - usefulness,\nPrivBayes uses a greedy algorithm to maximize the mutual information and to optimally\nstructure the tree-based Bayesian network.\n\n\nChapter 2 Related Work\n9\n2.1.2\nAutoencoder\nBack in 1987, Autoencoder [12] was first developed by Ballard. An autoencoder is a type\nof deep neural network used to solve an unsupervised learning task — representation\nlearning. That means the autoencoder could efficiently learn the coding of datasets.\nThus, it can usually be used to remove the redundancy and extract the important\ndata features. More specifically, a deep neural network contains a bottleneck inside the\nnetwork and then forces a compressed knowledge representation from the input data.\nFigure 2.2 shows the sample scheme for autoencoder.\nFigure 2.2: Autoencoder scheme from [2]\nA standard autoencoder contains two components: an encoder E( · ) and a decoder D( · ).\nThe encoder compresses the input and produces the code, the decoder then reconstructs\nthe input only using this code.\nTo be more specific, provide a dataset X, the encoder E( · ) compresses the input data x\nfrom X into a hidden distributed representation z (Compressed data from Figure 2.2).\nThe encoding step can be shown as:\nz = E(x), where x ∼X.\nThen the decoder D( · ) takes the hidden representation z and reconstructs it. Lastly, it\nwill produce ˆx:\nˆx = D(z), where ˆx ≈x.\nThe generated data ˆx is approximate to the original data x because a successful au-\ntoencoder aims to extract all the essential features of x. The x and ˆx should share\nthe same properties. Therefore, the autoencoder network is trained by minimizing the\nreconstruction error:\nL = (x, ˆx) = Ex∼X[∥D(E(x)) −x∥2\n2]\n\n\nChapter 2 Related Work\n10\nTypically, the reconstruction error is the mean squared error, which measures the dif-\nferences between the original input data and the later reconstruction ˆx.\nVariational Autoencoder\nThe Variational Autoencoder (VAE) [13] is a variant of standard autoencoder. The ‘vari-\national’ means that the encodings distribution is regularised during the training process\nto keep the approximate features and generate new data.\nThe architecture of a VAE is the same as a standard autoencoder. It contains an en-\ncoder E[ · ] and a decoder D[ · ]. The VAE is trained using the similar reconstruction\nerror L = (x, ˆx), which aims to minimize the difference between origin data and the\ngenerated data as well.\nAs mentioned before, some regularisation term is introduced to VAE. A small mod-\nification is applied to the encoding-decoding step to achieve the regularisation. In a\ntraditional autoencoder, the input data is a single point x from the original data X, and\nthe output is the hidden representation z. In VAE, the hidden representation is seen as\na Gaussian distribution N[ · ]. Therefore the hidden representation from a VAE encoder\nforms a normal distribution N(µ, σ2).\nµ, σ = E(x), where x ∼X.\nThe decoder takes one sample z from the N(µ, σ2) and reconstructs the data.\nˆx = Ez∼N(µ,σ)[D(z)], where ˆx ≈x.\nAdditionally, VAE made a constraints to force all the aggregated distribution of z over\nall the data X to be N(0, I). Under this constraint, we can input any vector sampled\nfrom N(0, I) into the trained decoder to generate new data.\nThe encoder-decoder pair is multi-input and multi-output deep neural networks and\ntrained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The Equation 2.1 shows the reconstruction\nerror is further modified as a evidence lower-bound (ELBO) loss.\nL = [ Ex∼N(µ,σI)[∥D(E(x)) −x∥2\n2] + KL(N(µ, σI)∥N(0, I)) ].\n(2.1)\nThe first term is precisely the same as the traditional autoencoder. The second term\nKL(p||q) is the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence. The KL divergence is used to measure\nthe distance between two distributions p and q using the following formula:\nKL(p||q) = −\nZ\nx\np(x) log q(x)\np(x)\n\n\nChapter 2 Related Work\n11\nIn the VAE case, we have the p as the standard normal distribution N(0, I), the q as\nthe distribution of z ∼N(µ, σI). Thus, this term makes a constraint to ensure the z to\nbe the standard normal distribution. The outer expectation is computed by taking the\naverage over minibatch. The training process will end when the model converges. The\nlearned D is an approximated mapping from a multivariate Gaussian distribution to the\ndata distribution.\n2.1.3\nGenerative Adversarial Network\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were firstly proposed by Goodfellow [4] in\n2014. GAN is a generative model using deep learning techniques to generate different\ntypes of data to fit the requirements of variant industry needs.\nGenerative modelling is an unsupervised learning task. GAN models convert the problem\nfrom an unsupervised learning task to a supervised learning task masterly using two sub-\nmodels: A generator G and a discriminator D.\nFigure 2.3: Training evolution of DCGAN [3]\nThe generator G is trained to generate new samples, and the discriminator D is required\nto recognize if the generated samples are real or fake. The training process is like an\nadversarial zero-sum competition as the G have to foolish the D and the D tries its\nbest to classify the provided data. During the training, the G and D grow together,\n\n\nChapter 2 Related Work\n12\nthe quality of generated data is higher and higher, as well as the ability to recognize D.\nFigure 2.3 shows the training evolution of a deep convolutional generative adversarial\nnetwork [3] which is commonly used to generate images. It is an example of generating\nsunset images from the first epoch to the 500th epoch. The growth of G and D shows\nthe adversarial process during training.\nVanilla GAN\nAs mentioned in the last section, the GAN model contains two deep neural networks\nthat make the training process quite complete; it has to solve those complications:\n• Handle two different training tasks (Generating and Classification)\n• Identify training convergence\nFigure 2.4 shows the flow chart for Vanilla GAN training. Vanilla GAN is the origin\nGAN training method proposed by Goodfellow [4]. The main training process can be\nbroken down into two alternating steps:\n1. Update Discriminator D.\n2. Update Generator G.\nThe two steps run repeatedly to continuous training the G and D.\nStep 1:\nThe Discriminator D is a classifier which needs to distinguish if the data is generated by\nthe Generator G. To train the classifier more accurately, we should use the data from\nboth data sources. The real data from the original data as the positive samples. The\nfake data generated by G as the negative samples. During the training, the D classifies\nboth real data and fake data and produces a D loss. The discriminator loss will penalize\nthe D for all misclassified samples. The D updates its weights through backpropagation\nfrom the D loss function Equation 2.2:\nLD = −Ex∼X[log(D(x))] + Ez∼N(0,I)[log(1 −D(G(z)))]\n(2.2)\nLD is the cross-entropy loss for binary classification.\nStep 2:\n\n\nChapter 2 Related Work\n13\nFigure 2.4: GAN Training Process\nThe Generator G is used to create fake data incorporating feedback from the Discrim-\ninator. It aims to fool the D and let D can not complete the classification task well.\nThe training process for G is more complicated. The whole training process involves\nthree components: Random Input which makes sure the GAN produce a wide variety\nof data; Generator G which generates the data using the random feed input and the\nD loss, which enhances the generating ability by penalizes the G for correctly classified\nsamples. The Generator G is optimized using the equation:\nLG = Ez∼N(0,I)[log(D(G(z)))]\n(2.3)\nMinimax Loss Function:\nThe MiniMax loss function(Equation 2.4) is commonly uses in standard GAN which is\ncombined from the LG(Equation 2.3) and LD(Equation 2.2). In this function the gener-\nator tries to minimize the following function while the discriminator tries to maximize\nit.\nEx∼X[log(D(x))] + Ez∼N(0,I)[log(1 −D(G(z)))]\n(2.4)\nIn the first term, D(x) is the probability estimation to indicate if the real instance x is\nreal. The Ex is the expected value among all real data instances. In the second term,\nG(z) is the generated data using the input noise z. D(G(z)) is the probability estimation\nto indicate if fake instance G(z) is real. The Ez is the expected value among all fake\n\n\nChapter 2 Related Work\n14\ndata instances. The formula derives from the cross-entropy between the real and fake\ndistributions. However, the Vanilla GAN always suffers from the mode collapse problem.\nMode collapse means the Generator keeps producing the same output data.\nWassersttein GAN\nWassersttein GAN [14] is a improved training method to solve the mode collapse prob-\nlem. WGAN uses a critic network C[ · ]. The output of the critic network C[ · ] is dynamic.\nWhen the input is more realistic, the output value is larger or vice versa.\nTo achieve this, the critic network is trained using:\nLC = −Ex∼X[log(C(x))] + Ez∼N(0,I)[log(1 −C(G(z)))]\n(2.5)\nThat means, the critic network is trying to maximize the output on real data and\nminimized the output of the generated data.\nConversely, the generator is trying to\nmaximize the output of the critic network using the following function:\nLG = −Ez∼N(0,I)[log(1 −C(G(z)))]\nWGAN aims to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the generated and real data\ndistribution. The Wasserstein distance will provide the between probability distributions\non a given metric space. The Wasserstein distance W( · )can be shown as:\nW(x, PG) =\nsup\n∥f∥L≤1\nEx∼X[f(x)] −Eˆx∼PG[f(ˆx]\nwhere ∥f∥L ≤1 indicates f is a 1-Lipschitz function.\nEquation 2.5 can be seen as approaching the Wasserstein distance equation. Therefore,\nthe training process for the Generator can be seen as minimizing the Wasserstein dis-\ntance. Note that parameters in the C are controlled to fit the 1-Lipschitz constraint.\nThe WGAN is also trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with the similar steps\nto Vanilla GAN: In the first step, WGAN updates Critic C, the next step is to update\nGenerator G. The two steps repeatedly run to continuous training the C and D.\nMostly, the training processes are the same as the Vanilla GAN training processes. Be-\nsides, we use Critic C instead of Discriminator G. Additionally, the parameter in C has\nto be modified to satisfy the 1-Lipschitz condition in step 1.\n\n\nChapter 2 Related Work\n15\n2.1.4\nGAN Variants for Tabular Data Generation\nThe initial GAN model was used to synthesize the image [4]. The development of GAN\nhas led to more and more varieties being proposed in different fields. Now, GAN models\nhave migrated from image data to tabular data.\nThis session summarizes the most\ncommonly used GAN-based tabular data generation models.\nModel\nDiscrete\nNumerical\nEnhanced\nMedGAN (2017)\n✓\nHigh-Dimensional\ntablgeGAN (2017)\n✓\nData Semantic\nCTGAN (2019)\n✓\n✓\nImbalanced Data\nOCTGAN (2021)\n✓\n✓\nImbalanced Data\nTable 2.1: Summary for commonly used Tabular data generation GAN models\nMedGAN\nMedGAN [15] was proposed by Choi et al. in 2017 to produce high-dimensional electronic\nhealth record (EHR) data in discrete variables. High-dimensional data suffers from the\ncurse of dimensionality. To overcome this, MedGAN develop an autoencoder to learn the\ndata representation. The original data can be represented as a low-dimensional data\nrepresentation without any information loss by using the autoencoder.\nMedGAN is limited applied to binary responses and continuous features.\nThe binary\nfeatures are represented as 1 or 0. The continuous features should apply a min-max\nnormalization method to normalized to the range [0,1] using the MinMax normalization\nformula:\nci,j −min(Ci)\nmax(Ci) −min(Ci))\n(2.6)\nwhere Ci means the ith continuous column and cij means the jth value in the ith con-\ntinuous column.\nFigure 2.5 shows the Architecture of MedGAN. The discrete x comes from the source\nEHR data, z is the random prior for the generator G; G is a feedforward network with\nshortcut connections (right-hand side figure); An autoencoder (i.e, the encoder Enc and\ndecoder Dec) is learned from x; The same decoder Dec is used after the generator G\nto construct the discrete output. The discriminator D tries to differentiate real input\nx and discrete synthetic output Dec(G(z)).\nThe pre-trained autoencoder is used to\nlearn discrete features, and then it can be applied to decode the continuous output of\nG. The autoencoder uses to mean a squared loss for the loss function to check if only\ncontinuous features exist in the generated data and cross-entropy loss to check if the\n\n\nChapter 2 Related Work\n16\ndiscrete columns are in binary. The loss function for the GAN model is the standard\nMinimax loss function (see Equation 2.6) from Vanilla GAN [4]. The loss function for\nthe autoencoder is the mean squared error if the table contains only continuous columns\nand cross-entropy loss if the columns are all binary. The generator and discriminator\nare trained using the same loss function as a vanilla GAN.\nHowever, the MedGAN does not support tabular data with mixed data types. Only contin-\nuous and binary discrete data is acceptable. The real-world data is usually complicated\nwith the mixed data type, and this is not very suitable in most real-world scenarios.\nFigure 2.5: Architecture of MedGAN\nTable-GAN\nTable-GAN [8] is a variation on the GAN Architecture published by Park et al.\nin\n2017. It applies the idea of DCGAN [3] which is a typically used image generation GAN\nmodel to generate tabular data to protect people‘s privacy. In this paper, Table-GAN\nis developed against three attacks: re-identification attack, attribute disclosure and\nmembership attack.\nThe Table-GAN is developed from Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network.\nUnlike the GAN model mentioned in the previous section, the Generator G and the Dis-\ncriminator D are a pair of Convolutional neural networks and De-convolutional neural\nwork. Additionally, Table-GAN add another neural network Classifier C to supervise the\nsemantic. Since DCGAN [3] was used for image generation. Thus the input data is not a\nvector but a matrix with a number. Thus, all the data should be prepossessed before\ntraining. For continuous variables, the MinMax normalization Equation 2.4 is applied;\nthe discrete variables are converted to floating-point numbers or one-hot vectors. After\n\n\nChapter 2 Related Work\n17\nthat, the preprocessed data should be re-arranged into a squared matrix. If the number\nof columns can not fill in a squared matrix, zeros are padded behind to increase the vec-\ntor length to form a squared matrix. For example, if the vector length for preprocessed\nfeatures is 12, then four zeros are padding behind, then the vector after padding can\nform a 4 × 4 matrix.\nFigure 2.6 shows the architecture of the Generator G and the Discriminator D from\nTable-GAN. The Generator G performs a series of deconvolution operations to generate\ndata, while the Discriminator D has the corresponding convolution layers to classify the\nreal and fake data. The final loss after the sigmoid activation can be back-propagated\nto the Generator. The dimensions of the latent vector input z and intermediate tensors\nshould be configured considering the number of attributes (e.g., 16 × 16 = 196 attributes\nin this figure). The Classifier C increases the semantic integrity of synthetic records that\nhave the same structure of the Discriminator D. For example, (cholesterol=50, dia-\nbetes=1) is not a correct record because cholesterol=50 is too low to be diagnosed as\ndiabetes. The C is trained by the ground-truth label from the original table, therefore\nit can recognize if the generated data is semantic correct.\nFigure 2.6: Architecture of table-GAN\nThe Table-GAN is trained using standard GAN loss function (Equation 2.4) with two\nadditional term.\nInformation Loss\nThe information loss is defined as the discrepancy between two statistics of synthetic\nand real records. The information loss compares the first-order statistics(mean) and\nsecond-order statistics(sd) using the Equation 2.7:\nLmean = ∥E[fx]x∼pdata(x) −E[fG(z)]z∼p(z)∥2\nLsd = ∥SD[fx]x∼pdata(x) −SD[fG(z)]z∼p(z)∥2\n(2.7)\n\n\nChapter 2 Related Work\n18\nThe less value of Lmean and Lsd indicates that real and synthetic records have the\nstatistically same features from the perspective of the discriminator. To make the privacy\ndegree more controllable, the two loss terms are combined with two thresholds using\nEquation 2.8.\nLG\ninfo = max(0, Lmean −δmean) + max(0, Lsd −δsd)\n(2.8)\nClassification Loss\nClassification loss maintains the semantic integrity using the Equation 2.9. It measures\nthe between the label of a generated record and the label predicted by the classifier for\nthat record.\nLC\nclass = E[|l(x) −C(remove(x))|]x∼pdata(x),\nLG\nclass = E[|l(G(x)) −C(remove(C(x)))|]z∼p(x)\n(2.9)\nwhere l( · ) is a function that returns the ground truth label, remove( · ) is to remove the\nlabel attribute and C( · ) is a label predicted by the classifier neural network.\nTable-GAN is a novel approach for tabular data generation with convolutional neural\nnetwork, but the CNN and classifier architecture restrict it only compatible with limited\ndata type.\nCT-GAN\nCTGAN [6] was proposed by Xu et al. from MIT in 2019. This paper uses Mode-specific\nnormalization to solve mixed data type and Non-Gaussian distribution assumption prob-\nlems and uses Conditional vectors to solve imbalanced categorical column problems.\nData Preprocessing\nThe discrete columns are represented in a one-hot vector, the ith discrete column is\ndonated as di. A special method called Mode-specific normalization is used to process\ncontinuous values. This method is used since the continuous columns in the real-world\nare usually not following a normal distribution but a Multi-modal distribution. In this\npaper, for each continuous column Ci, variational Gaussian mixture model is used to\nfind the number of Modes. Then fit a Gaussian mixture and find the parameters Mean,\nWeight and Standard Deviation of a mode respectively. For each value ci,j in Ci com-\npute the probability of ci,j coming from each mode. Using the most possible mode to\nnormalize ci,j, the normalized value donates as αi,j and the chosen mode is represent in\none-hot vector βi,j.\nAfter that, the representation of a row becomes the concatenation of continuous and\n\n\nChapter 2 Related Work\n19\ndiscrete columns can be written as follows:\nrj = α1,j ⊕βi,j ⊕...αNc,j ⊕βNc,j ⊕d1,j... ⊕dNd,j\nConditional Generator\nUsually, when a GAN model is trained using an unbalanced dataset, the data in the\nminor category will not be sufficiently represented. CTGAN uses a conditional generator\nto enforce that the Generator matches a given category.\nThe cond vector is introduced to indicate the condition. Recall that after the data\npreprocessing, all the discrete columns D1....DN end up as one-hot vector d1...dNd, such\nthat the ith one hot vector is di. The one-hot representation vector is the mask vector\nmi for each discrete column Di. All mask vectors are concated to form a cond vector.\nFor instance, for two discrete columns, D1 = {1, 2, 3} and D2 = {1, 2}, the condition for\nD2 assigned to 1. Thus, the D1 mask vectors m1 = [0, 0, 0] since no condition is assign\nto D1, and the D2 mask vectors m2 = [1, 0]; The final cond vector = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0].\nCTGAN use fully connected hidden layers in both generator and critics (discriminator).\nFor the generator, the input is a random variable z and output is our synthetic data. For\nthe Critics, the PACGAN [16] framework is used to prevent mode collapse. The model\nis trained using WGAN loss(Equation 2.5) with gradient penalty and Adam optimizer.\nFigure 2.7 shows the architecture of CTGAN, the cond vector feed into the conditional\ngenerator, that generates synthetic conditioned rows. With training-by-sampling, the\ncond and training data are sampled according to the log-frequency of each category,\nthus CTGAN can evenly explore all possible discrete values.\nFigure 2.7: Architecture of CTGAN\nNow, CTGAN has become a commonly used GAN-based tabular data generation method,\n\n\nChapter 2 Related Work\n20\nand it can generate data effectively with high-quality synthetic. Thus, CTGAN is one of\nthe models we used as the base model to further develop our method.\n2.2\nSelectivity Estimation\nQuery execution cost estimates the number of computational resources (e.g. CPU and\nI/O resources) for running queries in the current query plan.\nThe total query plan\ncost is computed by combining the cost of each of the operators appearing in the plan.\nSelection, Projection and Joint are three commonly used standard operators. In this\nthesis, we focus on the selection operation. Therefore, this session will introduce some\nregular approaches to the selectivity estimation method. In database systems, selectivity\nestimation has been extensively studied. Common approaches are sampling [17] and\nhistograms [18]. However, most of them suffer from the curse of dimensionality, which\nmeans they could not be compatible with the high-dimensional data. Mattig et al. [19]\nuse the Kernel-based cardinality to highlight the distribution of metric space. However,\nthe kernel function usually needs to be supported by strong assumptions, and a single\nkernel function sometimes is insufficient to solve the complicated inner correlation of\nhigh-dimensional data.\n2.2.1\nRegression-based Models\nAnother method is to see the Selectivity estimation as a regression problem with query\nobject and threshold as input features. Wang et al. [20] developed a Regression based\nmodel called Selnet to estimate the selectivity as well as maintain the consistency for\nhigh-dimensional data. Definition 2.1 shows how to form the selectivity to a regression\nproblem.\nDefinition 2.1 (Selectivity). Given a database with d dimensional vector D = {oi}n\ni=1,\noi ∈Rd. Provide a distance function dist( · ), a scaler threshold t and a query object\nx ∈Rd. The estimate the selectivity in the database can be written as:\n|{ o | dist(x, o) ≤t, o ∈D}|\nThe selectivity (i.e., the ground truth label) y of a query object x and a threshold t as\ngenerated by a value function:\ny = f(x, t, D)\nThus, the selective estimation can be seen as estimate f(x, t, D) using ˆf(x, t, D). How-\never, f is complex, thus f is broke into small sub-functions to rather than using one\n\n\nChapter 2 Related Work\n21\nfunction to estimate f directly. For example, let y = y1 + y2 and t = t1 + t2. Then we\ncan use two linear model to estimate corresponding y1 and y2 with t1 and t2 in the range\nof [0, t1] and (t1, t2]. Following this idea, the Threshold Partitioning method (Definition\n2.2) is adopt.\nDefinition 2.2 (Threshold Partitioning). Assume the maximum threshold is tmax, the\ntmax is divided it with an increasing sequence of (L + 2) value: [τ0, τ1, · · ·, τL+1]. We\nhave τ0 = 0 and τL+1 = tmax + ϵ where ϵ is a small positive quantity to cover corner\ncases. Let gi(x, t) be an interpolant function for interval [τi−1, τi) and we have:\nˆf(x, t, D) =\nL+1\nX\ni=1\n1[t ∈[τi−1, τi)] · gi(x, t)\n(2.10)\nWhere 1[ ] is the indicator function.\nSelnet uses L + 1 continuous piece-wise linear functions to implement gi(x, t) for the\nrange of [τi−1, τi) from Equation 2.10. The τi values are called control points. Let\npi be the estimated Selectivities at Control Points τi. The gi function can written\nusing τi and pi through:\ngi(x, t) = pi−1 + t −τi−1\nτi −τi−1\n· (pi −pi−1)\n(2.11)\nHence, τi and pi are the two parameters for each sub-regression model. The final estima-\ntion function can be re-parameterized as ˆf(x, t, D; Θ) where Θ represents {(τi, pi)}L+1\ni=0 .\nRegression-based estimation methods need to find the best control points and estimate\nthe corresponding pi, then combine the τi and pi to estimate the total selectivity y.\n\n\nChapter 3\nMethodology\nThis chapter will discuss the metrics we used and the methods used in our experiments.\nIn section 3.1, we will discuss the proposed methodology we use to enhance the GAN\nmodel to fulfil query selectivity constraints. Section 4.3 will introduce the metrics used\nto measure the quality of the synthesizing data.\n3.1\nProposed Method\nWe use the proposed methodology to enhance the Base Model to fulfil query selectivity\nconstraints through the Pre-Trained Selectivity Model. The Base Model could be any\nexisting GAN-based tabular data generation model. Figure 3.1 shows the overview of\nthe method process. The whole process can break into three steps:\n1. Data Transforming: Make the GAN model compatible with the mixed data type.\n2. Pre-trained Selectivity Model: Provide supervision for generated data.\n3. Base model Training: Incorporates the selective score during the Base Model train-\ning.\n3.1.1\nData Transforming\nTabular data usually contains multiple columns with continuous mixed type and cate-\ngorical type. From Chapter 2 we know that generating tabular data with mixed data\ntypes could be challenging for some of the existing GAN-based methods. CTGAN uses a\nReversible Data Transforms(RDT) for data pre-processing to handle mixed data types.\n22\n\n\nChapter 3 Methodology\n23\nFigure 3.1: Methodology Overview\nThe RDT converts the categorical features to one-hot vectors and uses the ”Mode-\nSpecific Normalization” method to convert a continuous feature to the corresponding\nMode and normalized value.\nCategorical Data\nThere are two types of categorical data in tabular data, ordinal and nominal. Nomi-\nnal data is classified without a natural order or rank (for example: Male and Female),\nwhereas ordinal data has a predetermined or natural order (for example: Small, Medium\nand Large). CTGAN uses One-hot Encoding to convert both nominal and ordinal data.\nOne-hot Encoding is a simple encoding method to creates additional features based\non the number of unique values in the categorical feature. This encoding method usu-\nally used to convert nominal type categorical data, but it may not suitable for ordinal\ndata. One-hot Encoding may not catch the natural ordered relationship between each\nresponse for ordinal data. For example, if we have a nominal categorical variable Dgender\nand an ordinal categorical variable Dsize.\nOne-hot Encoding represents Dgender =\n{F, M} are [1, 0] and [0, 1], represents Dsize = {small, medium, large} are [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0] and [0, 0, 1].\nOnt-hot Encoding provides an equal distance between outcomes. However, for ordinal\nvariable Dsize the distance between small and large should be larger than the distance\nbetween small and medium since the order matters in ordinal variables. The One-hot\nEncoding loses natural order information when converts ordinal variables.\nAs a result, we decide to use Ordinal Encoding for ordinal variables to maintain\nthe inner ordered relations to make sure the GAN model can understand and harness\n\n\nChapter 3 Methodology\n24\nthis relationship during the generation step. By using the Ordinal Encoding, the rep-\nresentation of Dsize = {small, medium, large} is [1, 2, 3]. We use di,j to represent the\nconverted value from the ith categorical column and jth row.\nContinuous Data\nWe continuous data we used the Mode-specific normalization method, which has been in-\ntroduced in CTGAN from session 2.1.4. The Mode-specific normalization method normal-\nizes a continuous column with multi-modal distributions. Figure 3.2 shows the histogram\nof daily temperature records through one year. It is a typical two-modal distribution\nexample where the two distribution indicates the temperature in winter and summer.\nFigure 3.2: Example of multi-modal distribution\nTo be specific,the Mode-specific normalization uses variational Gaussian mixture(VGM)\nmodel to find the number of Modes for each continuous column Ci and the parameters\nmean ηk and standard deviation ϕk of each mode. Then, for each value ci,j in Ci compute\nthe probability ρk of ci,j coming from each mode. Using the ρk to choose which mode\nthe value belong to and using the parameters from the selected mode to normalized the\nci,j. Finally, record the normalized value αi,j and the chosen mode represent in one-hot\nvector βi,j.\nFor example, in Figure 3.3 there are three mode are found by VGM with the mean value\nof η1, η2 and η3. Each mode is a Gaussian distribution with the parameter mean ηk and\nstandard deviation ϕk. Then a continuous value ci,j from column Ci appears. ci,j has\nthe ρ1, ρ2 and ρ3 of coming from each mode. It is more likely to come from the third\nmode η3. Thus, ci,j is normalized by the parameters from the third mode, using the\nformulae:\nci,j −ηk\nϕk\n.\n\n\nChapter 3 Methodology\n25\nWe use αi,j to represent the normalized value, βi,j(Mode indicator) is a one-hot vector\nwhich represents it allocated into the third mode [0, 0, 1]. Finally, a continuous value\nci,j can be converted into the concatenate of αi,j and βi,j\nFigure 3.3: Example of mode-specific normalization\nAfter the above transformation, the representation of the jth row becomes the concate-\nnation of continuous and discrete columns can be written as follows:\nrj = α1,j ⊕βi,j ⊕...αNc,j ⊕βNc,j ⊕d1,j... ⊕dNd,j\nA modified Reversible Data Transformer(mRDT) is built to transform the origin data\ninto the processed data and convert the processed back to the original form.\n3.1.2\nPre-trained Selectivity Model\nIn the second step, we need to train a model to estimate the selectivity for the original\ntabular data. After step one, the dimension of transformed data increases a lot. There-\nfore, we need a selectivity estimation model that can handle high-dimensional data.\nFinally, We decided to employ the simple version of Selnet [20] as our Pre-trained Se-\nlective Model. Selnet is designed to estimate the selectivity for high-dimensional data,\nwhich is quite suitable for our case. It is a regression-based deep learning model that\nlearns a query-dependent piecewise linear function as a selectivity estimator. The origi-\nnal implementation of Selnet contains a Data Partitioning part to improve the accuracy\nof estimation on large-scale datasets. We drop this part for the current implementation.\nRecall the Definition 2.1 Selectivity from Section 2.2.1:\nGiven a database with d dimensional vector D = {oi}n\ni=1, oi ∈Rd. Provide a distance\nfunction dist( · ), a scaler threshold t and a query object x ∈Rd. The estimate the\nselectivity in the database can be written as:\n|{ o | dist(x, o) ≤t, o ∈D}|\n\n\nChapter 3 Methodology\n26\nThe selectivity (i.e., the ground truth label) y of a query object x and a threshold t as\ngenerated by a value function:\ny = f(x, t, D)\nThrough the Definition 2.2 Threshold Partitioning, the estimation of selectivity\ncan be written as Equation (2.10). We use this Threshold Partitioning method, which\nmeans L + 1 piece-wise linear function is used to implement the interpolant function\ngi(x, t). Each g(x, t) contains corresponding τi and pi. The final estimation function\ncan be re-parameterized as ˆf(x, t, D; Θ) where Θ represents {(τi, pi)}L+1\ni=0 . Therefore, we\nneed to find the best control pointsτ and estimate the selectivity p, then combine all the\nτ and p to calculate the total selectivity ˆy.\nFigure 3.4: Architecture of Pre-trained Selectivity Model\nFigure 3.4 shows the architecture of the Pre-trained Selectivity Model. It is a com-\nplicated model which combines three deep neural network components. We firstly input\nthe query objects x to an Autoencoder(AE) to learn a latent representation. The AE\nencourages the model to use latent representation and query distributions for the piece-\nwise linear function. The AE makes the model more generalized and better for handling\nquery objects beyond the training data. Then the query objects x is feed in to the\nAE to learn the representation z. The origin x and representation z is concatenated\ntogether to form [x; z]. After that the [x; z] is fed into two independent deep neural\nnetworks: a feed-forward network (FFN) and M. The M is a encoder-decoder model.\nIn the encoder, an FFN is used to generate (L + 2) embeddings:\n[h0; h1; ...; hL+1] = FFN([x; z]),\nwhere his are high-dimensional representations to represent the latent information of p.\nThen, we adopt adopt (L + 2) linear transformations with the ReLU activation function:\nki = ReLu(wT\ni hi + bi)\n\n\nChapter 3 Methodology\n27\nThen, we have p = [k0, k0+k1, ... PL+1\ni=0 ki]. The output of FFN and M can be converted\nto the τ and p vector. Finally they can combine with the threshold t and fed into the\noperator Σ∗to compute the estimated selectivity ˆy. The Estimation Loss is used to\nestimate the loss between the true selectivity y and the estimated value ˆy of a query\n(x, t).\nJest(ˆj) =\nX\n((x,t),y)∈Ttrain\nl(f(x, t, D), ˆf(x, t, D)) = l(y, ˆy)\nDue to the use of AE, the final loss function(3.1) is a linear combination of the Estima-\ntion loss and the loss of the AE(JAE) during the training.\nJ( ˆf) = Jest(ˆj) + λ · JAE\n(3.1)\nIn our setting, the Selnet is trained to make sure the GAN model satisfies the selec-\ntivity constraint. We denote the transformed Torigin through mRDT as Dorigin. Using\nthe entire data set as the training query objects Qtrain to ensure the Selnet can be\ntrained properly. Then, the labels ytrain and thresholds ttrain are generated based on\nDorigin. Then, we use the training query objects Qtrain and ytrain to train the selectivity\nmodel. After the training is done, the model is ready to evaluate the performance of any\narbitrary synthesizing data through Mean Squared Error (MSE). The evaluation result\ncan be written as follows:\nLSel = MSE(y, ˆy)\n(3.2)\n3.1.3\nBase Model Training\nAfter the Selectivity Model is trained, we use the trained selectivity model to enhance\nthe Base Model.\nThe Base Model could be modified from any existing GAN-based\ntabular data generation model. Figure 3.5 shows the flowchart of the training process\nof Base Model.\nIn a standard GAN model, the Generator G will generate Fake data each iteration after\nreceiving a random noise. Then the Real data from the original input and Fake data\nwill both send into the Discriminator D. The D recognizes the Fake and Real, and then\nthe feedback is produced to Generator Loss and Discriminator Loss, respectively. After\nthat, the loss will be back-propagated to the G and D and start the next iteration. In our\nmethod, we can pick any arbitrary standard GAN model as the Base Model and then\nmake two changes during the Base Model training so that the produced data from Base\nModel can satisfy our requirements. One is the Selectivity Evaluation for the Fake data,\nand the other is the Generator Loss Function Modification before back-propagation.\n\n\nChapter 3 Methodology\n28\nFigure 3.5: Base Model Training Process\nSelectivity Evaluation\nDuring the GAN training process, the generator synthesis a fake tabular data in each\niteration. The synthesised data has the same format and dimension with the transformed\ndata, therefore there is no need to further per-processed the synthesised data. Then for\neach Fake data, we generate the test query Qtest, labels ytest and thresholds ttest. Note\nthat the labels ytest are computed on Dorigin, not Qtest, thus the estimated selectivity\nperformance will not be overestimated. Then the Qtest and labels ytest will send to the\nPre-trained Selectivity Model to predict the ˆytest. The evaluation metric is MSE which\nis calculated through equation (3.2). The evaluation result is donated as LSel. The LSel\nindicates that if the Qtest fulfill the selectivity constraints, the less MSE score means\nthe better performance.\nGenerator Loss Function Modification\nThe selectivity estimation score LSel could not only indicate the performance of the Fake\ndata but also shows the ability of the Generator G in the current status. To improve the\ncapability of G, we add the LSel to the Generator Loss LG. Thus the G will modify itself\nto minimize the loss function then the selectivity constraints will be satisfied. Thus, the\nloss function for the Generator G is adapted as:\nL∗\nG = LG + α · LSel\n(3.3)\n\n\nChapter 3 Methodology\n29\nwhere the LSel is the Selectivity Loss (3.2) and α is the hyper-parameter indicates\nthe weight of the Selectivity Loss term to avoid the large selectivity Loss dominating\nthe whole loss value. For the Discriminator D we remain the same loss function. In\ngeneral, the loss functions should be globally continuous and differentiable. Fortunately,\nthe added term to Generator loss is MSE, one of the simplest and most typical loss\nfunctions. Thus the modified loss function should work well theoretically.\nOverall, Algorithm 1 shows the Generator training algorithm.\nAlgorithm 1 Generator Training Algorithm\nInput: Torigin\nOutput: Trained Generator G\n1: Selnet ←Pre-Trained Selectivity model\n2: G ←Generator\n3: D ←Discriminator\n4: Dorigin ←mRDT(Torigin)\n5: for number of epoch do\n6:\nfor k steps do\n7:\nCreate a mini-batch of random noise Z = {z1, ..., zn}\n8:\nSample a mini-batch of real data X = {X1, ..., Xn} from Dorigin\n9:\nTrain D by maximizing equation (2.2)\n10:\nend for\n11:\nCreate a mini-batch of random noise Z = {z1, ..., zn}\n12:\nGenerate Qtest and Labels ytest using G(Z)\n▷Labels are computed on Dorigin\n13:\nLSel ←Selnet([Qtest : ytest])\n14:\nL∗\nG = LG + α · LSel\n15:\nTrain G by minimizing L∗\nG\n16: end for\n17: return G\n3.1.4\nBase Model\nThis thesis employs two existing models as our Base Model to test our proposed method’s\ncompatibility.\nCTGAN\nCTGAN is a commonly used baseline tabular data synthesizing GAN model. It could\nsynthesize data in high quality and solve imbalanced data problems by introducing\nadditional conditions. It uses RDT to prepossess data and then send the prepossessed\ndata to the CTGAN model. CTGAN uses PACGAN framework to prevent mode collapse\nand WGAN loss (2.5) with gradient penalty and Adam optimizer. Figure 2.7 shows\n\n\nChapter 3 Methodology\n30\nthe architecture of CTGAN. We use CTGAN as our Base Model and combine it with our\nmethod. The completed model we name it SelGAN.\nDaisy\nDaisy [21] is a survey paper which compares the different GAN-based frameworks in the\ntabular data synthesizing field. We want to use a standard GAN-based tabular data gen-\neration method to conduct further ablation studies to test whether our proposed method\nworks well. In Daisy work, we find that utilizing a sequence generation mechanism (such\nas recurrent neural networks(RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)) as Generator\ncould generate attributes separately in sequential timesteps and provide robust results.\nAs a result, we decide to employ an LSTM as the Generator and a standard MLP as\nthe Discriminator as the Base Model. Again, we use RDT to prepossess data and then\nsend the prepossessed data to the Base Model and add our proposed method. The final\nresulted model we call it Daisy-sel.\n\n\nChapter 4\nExperiments\nIn this chapter, we will discuss the implementation of experiments.\nWe will briefly\nintroduce the five real-world datasets in section 4.1. Section 4.2 and Section 4.4 will\ntalk about the four baseline models and parameter setting for each models and dataset.\nSection 4.5 shows the evaluation results using the metrics mentioned in section 4.3. An\nablation study is also conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our method.\n4.1\nDataset\nIn our experiments, we choose five commonly used real-world from UCI Machine Learn-\ning Repository and Kaggle.\n• Adult1: Contains the work-hour attribute has the information of work hours per\nweek for each individual.\n• Covertype2: Contains cartographic variables for four wilderness areas located in\nthe Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado.\n• Ticket3: Contains the data for the plane tickets.\n• News4: Contains a heterogeneous set of features about articles published.\n• CreditCard5: Contains PCA data with 28 dimensions of fraudulent credit card\ntransactions information.\nThose data sets contains both high and low dimension data with mixed type which\nmeans all dataset contain both numerical and categorical data. Table 4.1 shows the\nsummary of chosen datasets. As a result, all data can be sent to both regression and\n31\n\n\nChapter 4 Experiments\n32\nclassification task in the later machine learning utility tests. For regression task we use\neducutation num from Adult, soil type from Covertype, amount from CreditCard,\nshares from News, and passengers from Ticket as our response.\nFor classification\ntask we use sex’ from Adult, cover type from Covertype, class from CreditCard,\nis lifestyle from News, and mktcoupons from Ticket as our response.\nName\n#Instance\n#Columns\n#Continuous\n#Ordinal\n#Nominal\nAdult\n30148\n15\n6\n1\n8\nCovertype\n77469\n13\n10\n0\n3\nTicket\n5000\n38\n4\n0\n34\nNews\n39644\n60\n46\n0\n14\nCreditCard\n14241\n30\n28\n0\n1\nTable 4.1: Summary of datasets\n4.2\nBaseline Models\nFor baseline models, we mentioned existing works VAE, MedGAN, tablgeGAN, CTGAN,\nand OCTGAN in Chapter 2. MedGAN is limited to generated binary response which is not\nsuitable for our data set. Therefore, we abandon the MedGAN. OCTGAN failed in Ticket\ndue to mode collapse.\ntablgeGAN has a classifier component inside to maintain the\nsemantic, which needs a binary response column as the label input for the classifier.\nOnly Adult and CreditCard datasets contain a binary response. Therefore tablgeGAN\nonly successfully works for those two datasets. Also, generated data could not produce\nthe label input, and we do not adopt tablgeGAN to the Selectivity Estimation Test.\nSelGAN is one of our resulting model mentioned in 3.1.4.\nTable 4.2 shows the compatibility for each model.\nModel\nAdult\nCovertype\nTicket\nNews\nCreditCard\nSelGan\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\nCT-GAN\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\nOCT-GAN\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\ntablGAN\n✓\n✓\nVAE\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\nTable 4.2: Model Compatible table\n1Adult: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult\n2Covertype: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype\n3Ticket: https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DataIndex.asp.\n4News: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+news+popularity\n5CreditCard: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud\n\n\nChapter 4 Experiments\n33\n4.3\nEvaluation Metrics\nQuality assessment of generated data is not a simple task. Through different propose\nand setting, different evaluation metric is designed.\nWe will introduce the designed\nmetric and how to evaluate the synthesizing data in the three aspects.\n4.3.1\nMode Collapse\nMode Collapse is a common problem for the GAN-based model. The synthesizing data\nis supposed to be diverse. Since the generator is always trying to find the one output\nthat seems most plausible to the discriminator, thus if a generator produces a plausible\noutput, it might learn only to produce that output. Therefore generators keep producing\na small set of output over and over again. We will input the same amount of origin data\nfor each model by testing this problem and letting them generate the same amount of\ndata. Check if there are duplicated records exist in the generated data.\n4.3.2\nVisualization\nWe expect the synthesized data to be close to the original data. For numerical columns,\none simplest way is to visualize the data distribution. Visualizations could provide us\nwith a clear view of the comparison results. We could recognize if the model gener-\nates the correct number of modes or if the model can handle outliers. We compared\nthe cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of each column’s origin data and synthe-\nsized data to evaluate whether a generated synthesized data is close to the origin data\nstatistically. Also, we plot Pearson correlation heat maps. A correlation heat map is\na graphical representation of a correlation matrix representing the correlation between\ndifferent variables. These Pearson Correlation Heat Maps can test if the synthetic data\ncontains the inner linear correlation between features.\n4.3.3\nSelectivity Estimation\nAs one of the major contributions of our works, we will evaluate the selectivity estimation\nscore for Torigin and TSynth. This test is conducted to compare the ability to handle\nselectivity for models. Similar to before, we used a pre-trained selectivity estimation\nmodel metric. Each TSynth will generate the 1000 queries QSynth based on Dorigin. The\nqueries are sent into the pre-trained model and result in MSE score to indicate if the\nTSynth satisfy the selectivity constraints. Each experiment is repeated ten times. The\naverage lower MSE score shows better performance on fulfilling selectivity constraints.\n\n\nChapter 4 Experiments\n34\n4.3.4\nMachine Learning Utility\nData utility is highly dependent on the specific needs of the synthetic data for down-\nstreaming tasks. We use the Machine learning score to evaluate the effectiveness of using\nsynthetic data as training data for machine learning tasks. We conduct both supervised\nlearning tasks and unsupervised learning to evaluate the data quality thoroughly. For\nthe supervised learning task, we first need to choose our task and separate the features\nX and labels y from the original data table Torigin. Then split the origin data feature\nX into the training set Xtrain and test set Xtest. Then, we extract the features from\nsynthesizing data table TSynth denote as XSynth. We use Xtrain and XSynth to train\nthe machine learning models. Then, we could use Xtest to test the performance of each\nmodel. XGBoost, RandomForest and SVM are employed as regressors and classifiers to\nmake the results more accurate. For the classification task, the accuracy or F1 score\nwill be used. In the regression task, R2 and MSE will be used.\n4.4\nParameter Setting\nAll experiments are conducted on the ‘Spartan’ [22] server, which is the general purpose\nHigh-Performance Computing (HPC) system operated by Research Computing Services\nat The University of Melbourne. The partition deeplearn we used contains 13 nodes,\neach with four NVIDIA V100 graphics cards and six nodes each with four NVIDIA A100\ngraphics cards. The implementation for the Python version is 3.7.4 (compatible with\nTensorFlow 1.15, which is required for tableGAN) and 3.8.6.\nWe use source code for baseline models CT-GAN6, OCT-GAN7, tableGAN8, VAE and Daisy9\nwith their default parameters.\nAs our method is orthogonal to any existing GAN model, the performance of our method\nis largely dependent on the capability of the Base Model, and we do not need to do the\nparameter truing for the Base Model. SelGAN and Daisy-Sel uses the same parameters\nwith CTGAN and Daisy. To ensure the fairness of experiments, we use batch size 500 for\nVAE and all GAN-based models with 300 training epochs using an Adam optimizer.\nSelnet10 is used as the pre-trained selectivity component. We use complete origin data\nTorigin to train Selnet models with batch size 512. The training epoch for AE is 100\n6CT-GAN: https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN\n7OCT-GAN: https://github.com/bigdyl-yonsei/OCTGAN\n8table-GAN https://github.com/mahmoodm2/tableGAN\n9VAE and Daisy https://github.com/ruclty/Daisy\n10Selnet:https://github.com/yyssl88/SelNet-Estimation\n\n\nChapter 4 Experiments\n35\nand 120 for other models. The parameter α from equation (3.3) is set as 0.01 to avoid\nlarge selectivity loss dominate the whole loss value.\n4.5\nResults analysis\nIn this session, we conduct a complete evaluation of our method to understand the\nquality of synthetic data in the metrics mentioned before.\n4.5.1\nMode Collapse\nTable 4.3 show the rate of repeated data. We use this method to check if the model suffers\nfrom mode collapse. The higher value indicates that the mode collapse phenomenon is\nserious. From the table, we can see that the VAE model suffers from the mode collapse\nproblem the most. SelGAN is not suffering from this problem as well as its Base Model\nCTGAN. The standard capability of SelGAN depends on the Base Model. We can only\ncomment that our method will not cause any mode collapse, but we could not make any\ncomment on if our method could ease mode collapse.\nModel\nAdult\nCovertype\nTicket\nNews\nCreditCard\nCT-GAN\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nOCT-GAN\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\ntableGAN\n3.2\n−\n−\n−\n0\nVAE\n0.779\n0\n9.78\n0\n84.83\nSelGAN\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nTable 4.3: Rate of Repeated Data (%)\n4.5.2\nVisualization\nDue to the space limit, we do not reveal the complete visualization plots in this chapter,\nand more plots are shown in Appendix B.\nCDF Comparison\nThree interpret-able continuous columns are chosen for the CDF comparison.\nFig-\nure 4.1, Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3 shows age in Adult, aspect in Covertype and\nglobal subjectivity in news.\nThe left-hand side shows an overall CDFs compari-\nson among all baseline model and our resulting model SelGAN. The comparison of CDFs\n\n\nChapter 4 Experiments\n36\nfor SelGAN and SelGAN-w/o Sel are showns in the right hand side. The SelGAN-w/o\nSel model removes the selectivity estimation component for ablation studies.\nFrom\nthses plots, CDFs of SelGAN in orange are close to CDFs of Torigin in blue, suggesting\nthat SelGAN performs quite well. However, SelGAN could not fit well at the beginning\nand end in Figure 4.2, that means our SelGAN does not always successfully capture the\nstatistics of the Torigin. But, SelGAN still outperform among other base line models\nvisually.\nFigure 4.1: age in Adult\nFigure 4.2: aspect in Covertype\nFigure 4.3: global subjectivity in News\nCorrelation Heat Map\nFigure 4.4 and Figure 4.5 shows the Correlation Heap Map for Adult and CreditCard.\nFrom Figure 4.4, we can see SelGAN generates a similar pattern and color with the\nTorigin. CTGAN and VAE also generate similar patterns and colours, but there are some\nmassive patterns inside. OCTGAN and tableGAN fail to produce the inner correlations.\n\n\nChapter 4 Experiments\n37\nFrom Figure 4.5, we find OCTGAN and VAE simulate the correlation pretty good, but CTGAN\nfailed. SelGAN produce a similar colour but fails to generate the pattern. We realise that\nit is hard to evaluate the performance just by visuals. Thus, we conduct a difference\nin pair-wise correlation comparison test to assess the correlation performance at the\nquantity level. Table 4.4 summarize the difference in pair-wise correlation between the\ncorrelation matrix of origin data Torigin and correlation matrix of synthetic data TSynth.\nThe smaller value indicates that the synthetic data can mimic the correlation well.\nFrom this table, we find that SelGAN outperforms the other GAN-based models in two\ndatasets. We also investigate an interesting phenomenon, VAE models have the lowest\ndistance in Adult and Covertype, but it does not show ideal results in the other three\ndatasets. However, SelGAN has the second-best results in Adult and Covertype. Thus\nwe can conclude that overall, SelGAN can handle the inner correlation between dataset\nfeatures well.\nFigure 4.4: Correlation Heap Map for Adult\nModel\nAdult\nCovertype\nTicket\nNews\nCreditCard\nCT-GAN\n2.79\n21.94\n59.59\n79.00\n100.48\nOCT-GAN\n2.04\n26.96\n−\n46.24\n85.82\ntableGAN\n10.09\n−\n−\n−\n467.84\nVAE\n0.76\n15.99\n91.41\n54.9\n554.05\nSelGAN\n0.93\n19.79\n45.54\n75.07\n66.13\nTable 4.4: Difference in pair-wise correlation\n\n\nChapter 4 Experiments\n38\nFigure 4.5: Correlation Heap Map for News\n4.5.3\nSelectivity Estimation\nTable 4.5 shows the average summary results for the Selectivity estimation accuracy.\nFrom the table, we could see that there are clear reductions for SelGAN among all\nbaseline models. The average decrease rate in MSE score is around 20%. Since the\nability of our model is also dependent on the ability of the Base Model, we find that\nthe scores are various between baseline models. Thus, further ablation studies are still\nrequired to understand better if our method can successfully enhance the existing model\nto fulfil the selectivity constraints.\nModel\nAdult\nCovertype\nTicket\nNews\nCreditCard\nCT-GAN\n40.93\n98.82\n66.12\n111.38\n230.75\nOCT-GAN\n55.53\n128.04\n−\n163.73\n247.22\nVAE\n63.49\n97.27\n68.07\n132.29\n238.40\nSelGAN\n23.86\n82.50\n54.83\n104.36\n200.01\nTable 4.5: Selectivity Estimation MSE in 102\n4.5.4\nMachine Learning Utility\nWe conducted both classification and regression for all datasets.

For classification tasks, We plot the Accuracy vs F1-\nscore for all three machine learning models for five datasets (Figure 4.6).\nThis plot\nshows that for the dataset Ticket and CreditCard, SelGAN largely outperforms all others\n\n\nChapter 4 Experiments\n39\nFigure 4.6: ACC and F1 Score for Classification Task over five datasets\nacross all used machine learning models.\nFor dataset Adult and Covertype, SelGAN\noutperforms all GAN-based models.

SelGAN\nshows relatively stable results with high compatibility.\nWe also use Table 4.6 and Table 4.7 table to summarize the averaged machine learning\nutility score between Torigin and synthetic data in terms of accuracy, F1 score and MSE.\nA better synthetic data is expected to have a similar performance to the Torigin.

In our proposed method, we use an m-RDT pre-\nprocessing method for the proposed data to send to the downstream model more easily.\nThrough m-RDT, we should use Ordinal encoding for ordinal attributes rather than\none-hot vectors. That means we will not have enough experimental data to support\nthe impact of using Ordinal encoding or One-Hot encoding. Therefore, we abandon the\nablation study of the m-RDT component.\nAs mentioned in Section 3.1.4. We combined our method with two existing GAN base\nmodels. These two resulting models are used to test our method’s flexibility and com-\npatibility and check if our method can successfully enhance the synthetic data quality.\nWe remove the pre-trained selectivity component from the model and then redo the test\nto see the performance differences.\nThe following are the two pairs of models we used for the ablation study:\n• SelGAN and SelGAN-w/o Sel\n• Daisy-Sel and Daisy\n\n\nChapter 4 Experiments\n41\nOn the right-handed side of each figure from Figure 4.1, Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3, the\nCDS distributions of between Torigin and TSynth are revealed. Table 4.8, Table 4.9 and\nTable 4.10 shows the quantity comparison of selectivity estimation and machine learn-\ning performance. In Table 4.8, we find that the average decrease rate for adding the\nselectivity component is 27%, which is a significant drop in the selectivity score. That\nis strong evidence to say that our method does help the current GAN model meet the\nselectivity constraints. As well as the machine learning utility, we can observe trivial\ndifferences among them in most cases. In Table 4.10, Daisy-sel pair in CreditCard\ndataset and SelGAN pair in Covertype dataset share the same results. Therefore, both\nDaisy-sel and SelGAN show better results than the Daisy and SelGAN-w/o Sel re-\nspectively.

Through this method,\nwe can synthesize data with a similar selectivity to the origin data Torigin. Then the\nsynthetic data can be used to estimate query execution cost more accurately and further\nestimate the computational resources required if we create queries to the Torigin.\nIn Chapter 1, we introduce the background and aim of our project.\nWe listed four\nchallenges for current tabular data synthesizers, including Data Shortage Issue, Data\nPrivacy Issue, and Data Quality Issues in both the Machine Learning utility and Data\nConstraints aspects. Then we talked about how the promising tabular data generation\nmethod GAN handles these four challenges. We found that current state-of-the-art GAN\nmodels have made successes in the first three challenges, but there is a research gap\nbetween the current method and the fourth challenge. Motivated by the E-commerce\nplatforms problem, we decided to develop a tabular data generation GAN to model\nselectivity constraints in tabular data synthesizing and contribute to solving the last\nIssue.\nIn Chapter 2, we reviewed some common approaches of tabular data synthesizing meth-\nods from statistical and machine learning aspects. Bayesian network [11] is a statistical\ndata generation method. It can describe a dataset as a directed acyclic graph. The\ndependency or relations can be represented through edges and nodes. In the machine\nlearning aspect, we introduce the Variational Auto-encoder. It is a variant of a standard\nauto-encoder whose encoding distribution is regularised during the training process to\nkeep the approximate features and generate new data. Then, we introduced some GAN\n42\n\n\nChapter 5 Conclusion and Future Work\n43\nvariants for tabular data generation including MedGAN, tableGAN, CTGAN and OCTGAN.\nThey developed different methods to make the GAN model solve the first three chal-\nlenges mentioned before. MedGAN is designed for high-dimensional medical record data,\nbut it can only generate numerical and binary data. tableGAN uses a convolutional\nneural network as the generator G and adds a classifier to maintain the semantics of\nsynthetic data. CTGAN and OCTGAN are all aim to solve the in-balanced data distribu-\ntion problem through a conditional vector and neural ordinary differential equations\n(NODEs). We also studied different approaches for selectivity estimation, such as the\nhistogram-based and regression-based methods.\nIn Chapter 3, we talked about the proposed method after consulting many relevant\nmaterials and learning from GAN-based tabular data generation methods. Finally, we\ndecided to develop a flexible method to combine any existing GAN-based tabular data\ngeneration method to model the selectivity constraints. We first need to send the origin\ndata Torigin to train the selectivity estimation model. The pre-trained selectivity estima-\ntion model will supervise the Generator’s performance during the GAN model training\nprocess. The supervision feedback term is added to the Generator loss function, and the\nGenerator can use this feedback to adjust itself in each iteration. We also modified the\ncurrent data pre-processing step to make the method more suitable for the various data\ntypes.\nIn Chapter 4, we introduce the detail of the experiments. Overall, our proposed method\nis an enhanced method to the current GAN based model; thus, the major capability\nin large depends on the Base Model we used to combine.\nTo satisfy the selectivity\nconstraints as well as the quality of the synthetic data, we implement our method to the-\nstate-of-art tabular data generation model CTGAN and resulting SelGAN. The selectivity\nestimation results show that SelGAN can model tabular data with selectivity constraints\nsuccessfully, and it is also robust over different datasets to compare with three GAN-\nbased models and one VAE model.\nUsing the results from machine learning utility\ntests and statistical tests in visual, we can conclude SelGAN can also effectively model\ntabular data and generate high-quality synthetic data. We also combine a GAN model\nwithout outstanding performance, resulting Daisy-Sel to test the compatibility of our\nmethod. Finally, we conduct an ablation study for SelGAN and Daisy-Sel to analyze the\nimportance of the pre-trained selectivity estimation term. We remove the pre-trained\nterm and rerun the tests. The results show that our method is efficient.\n\n\nChapter 5 Conclusion and Future Work\n44\n5.2\nFuture Direction\nThere are still some limitations of our method. Therefore, in the future work, we plan\nto explore the following aspects:\n1. More query operators could be considered\nThere are many query operators in a query execution plan. Now, we only focus\non the selection. More commonly used query operators like projection and joint\ncould be considered in the future.\nThe selection and projection involve only one single data table. Therefore, the\nmodelling cost for selection and projection should be similar. We use projection\nqueries to train the current model or to replace the current model with a projection\nestimation model.\nHowever, modelling joint constraints should be more complicated since the joint\noperation involves two or more data tables. To model the joint constraints, we\nconsider that we should use multiple parallel GAN models for each data table.\nEach GAN model will produce a single data table in each iteration, and then we\nshould calculate the joint cost for the current generated table and provide them\nfeedback. Then the feedback is sent to each GAN model to update the G. The\nmultiple GAN training method should be parallel to ensure all sub-GAN models\ncan grow and interact together. One limitation for that the multiple GAN model\ncould be too complicated.\nSince the number of GAN components depends on\nthe joint constraints, we have to run the same number of sub-GAN components\nsimultaneously if a joint constraint involves a large number of the data table. That\ncould be a huge cost of computational resources.\n2. Improvement on Selectivity component\nCurrently, we use Selnet as our pre-trained selectivity estimation model.\nWe\npicked this Selnet because it can handle the high-dimensional data. We failed\nto use the sampling and histograms based or Gradient boosting trees regression-\nbased estimation method due to the curse of dimensionality. In the future, more\nselectivity estimation models are worth trying to improve estimation accuracy\nfurther. To solve the high-dimensional data, we could try to train an Auto-Encoder\nto learn the representation of synthetic data.\nWe sent the synthetic data into\nthe Encoder to get the representation. Then we sent the representation into the\nestimation model to receive feedback and use the feedback to update G. Even\nthough the model could not handle the high-dimensional data, it can still handle\nthe representation with lower dimensions. Nevertheless, we need to consider that\n\n\nChapter 5 Conclusion and Future Work\n45\ncould the representation have any statistically meaning to fit the logic of estimation\nmodels.\nIn addition, we employed an existing selectivity estimation model previously. Nev-\nertheless, we should have a novel, own-designed selectivity model for our scenario.\n3. Satisfy industrial needs\nThis project is motivated by the E-commence platform cases. However, our current\nmethod is not yet satisfied industrial needs. We have to solve the previous two\nfuture directions and then consider them for industry application. There is one\nbig challenge for the E-commence platform in a real-world scenario: we have to\ndynamically update the users’ data. In the E-commence platform cases, users’\ndata or transactions should be updated frequently. Our method can only handle\nthe static data table. If the data table changes, we must redo the GAN model\ntraining. However, that should be a common issue for GAN-based models or even\nall static machine learning models. To solve this problem, we should consider a\nDynamic Training method.\n4. More experiments in other GAN variants\nIn this thesis, we only test two existing models. These two existing models have\ndifferent architectures but still can not be representative enough. There are lots\nof varieties in GAN-based tabular generation methods. We can implement our\nmethod to more GAN models and further analyze whether the selectivity im-\nprovement would be changed due to the other GAN architectures.\n5. Hyper-parameter setting\nDuring the GAN training process, we add the LSel into the LG. We define the\nparameter α = 0.01 to control the weight of LSel. This weight is to ensure the\nLSel will not dominate the whole loss function. However, the scale of LSel for the\ndifferent datasets is various, and a single value of α may not work well. Thus,\nmore precision experiments are required. We may need to test new α for different\ndatasets or use some normalization function to normalize the LSel in a certain\nrange.\n\n\nAppendix A\nNotations\nNotation\nDescription\nGeneral:\nTorigin\nOriginal Data\nTSynth\nSynthetic data produced by model\nPre-processing:\nCi\nith continuous column\nDi\nith discrete column\nci,j\nValue in the i-th continuous column of j-th row\ndi,j\nValue in the i-th discrete column of j-th row\nm-RDT\nModified Reversible Data Transforms\nαi,j\nnormalized value for ci,j\nβi,j\nMode representation for ci,j\nm-RDT\nModified Reversible Data Transforms\nGAN model:\nD\nDiscriminator\nG\nGenerator\nQuery Generation:\nDorigin\nTransformed Original Data\nQtrain\ntesting query objects\nQtest\ntraining query objects\nGAN training:\nLG\nGenerator Loss\nLSel\nSelectivity Loss\nLD\nDiscriminator Loss\nX ∼{X1, X2, X2}\nReal data sampled from Dorigin\nZ ∼{Z1, Z2, Z2}\nNoisy data sampled from N ∼(0, 1)\nTable A.1: Notations\n46\n\n\nAppendix B\nFigures\nComplete CDFs and correlation heat maps visualization plots from Chapter 4\nFigure B.1: education-num in Adult\nFigure B.2: fnlwgt in Adult\nFigure B.3: capital-loss in Adult\n47\n\n\nAppendix\n48\nFigure B.4: elevation in Covertype\nFigure B.5: slope in Covertype\nFigure B.6: hillshade noon in Covertype\nFigure B.7: Amount in Credit\nFigure B.8: MktDistance in Ticket\n\n\nAppendix\n49\nFigure B.9: Passengers in Ticket\nFigure B.10: title subjectivity in News\nFigure B.11: shares in News\nFigure B.12: average token length in News\nFigure B.13: LDA00 in News\n\n\nAppendix\n50\nFigure B.14: Correlation Heap Map for Covertype\nFigure B.15: Correlation Heap Map for Ticket\n\n\nAppendix\n51\nFigure B.16: Correlation Heap Map for Credit\n\n\nBibliography\n[1] Jun Zhang, Graham Cormode, Cecilia M Procopiuc, Divesh Srivastava, and Xiaokui\nXiao.

In this study, we investigated phase transition engineering in Ag \nelectrodes via Cu and Zn alloying, transforming from a cubic to a tetragonal phase. These \nalloyed electrodes are then thermally deposited as back electrodes in perovskite solar cells. We \nconducted a comprehensive analysis of the pure Ag and Ag-Cu-Zn alloys deposited atop a hole-\ntransport layer for use in Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3-based solar cells. Our findings \nreveal that solar cells developed with pure Ag electrodes demonstrate a power conversion \nefficiency (PCE) of 18.71%, characterized by a fill factor (FF) of 74.8%, an open-circuit voltage \n(VOC) of 1.08 V, and a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.17 mA/cm². Conversely, solar \ncells fabricated with optimized Ag0.875Cu0.120Zn0.005 electrodes exhibit enhanced performance \nmetrics, with an FF of 72.5%, VOC of 1.12 V, and JSC of 23.39 mA/cm², culminating in an \nelevated PCE of 19.02%. Moreover, this electrode demonstrates remarkable durability, \nsustaining operational integrity for 460 hours for the PSCs stored in N2 glove box, in contrast \nto the 320 hours for cells with Ag electrodes. The Ag-Cu-Zn alloys exhibited high resistance to \ncorrosion and good adhesion on the hole-transport material layer compared to a layer of Ag. \nThese advancements may lead to the realization of cost-effective, durable, and efficient solar \nenergy conversion systems. \n1. Introduction \nPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently been demonstrated as potential candidates for the \nnext generation of green and renewable energy conversion due to their low material and \nmanufacturing cost, scalable fabrication capability, and very high efficiency achieved[1,2]. The \nlong-term stability of perovskite materials is still a major challenge for commercialization[3,4]. \nFactors such as heat, oxygen and moisture lead to degradation of the perovskite materials and \nhave garnered significant attention from researchers due to their significant impact on the \nstability and longevity of perovskite-based devices[5,6]. Additionally, there is growing attention \ntowards understanding the mechanisms behind the reduced stability of perovskite solar cells, \nparticularly due to ion migration between the electrode and the perovskite layer[7,8]. \nThe metals with suitable work function and conductivity have been chosen as electrodes in \nPSCs. The metallic layers of Al, Au, Cu and Ag have been reported to be used regularly for \nback-contact electrodes in PSCs. Properties of different materials, interfaces, and morphology \nof the electrodes influence the overall device performance. Al is not a preferred material for \nPSCs due to its susceptibility to corrosion and oxidation[9,10]. Al may also react with degradation \nproducts of the perovskite layer producing organo-aluminum compounds or alternatively anion \nradicals. These compounds can easily react with any proton donor present (e.g.  a trace of water \nor with oxygen)[11].  Ag electrode is broadly used in the PSCs, but its reactive and corrosive \nnature with perovskite consistently induces the critical stability issue[12,13].  As well, Ag atoms \n\n\n \n \n2 \n \ndiffuse into the perovskite layer, they can accelerate the reaction with iodine species, and induce \nthe deep level defects in the perovskite layer[14,15]. Cu is a more appropriate electrode material \nfor higher stability of PSCs than conventional Al and Ag electrodes. Cu has been observed to \ndiffuse into and react with the perovskite layer, and the infrared and ultraviolet contents in the \nsunlight accelerate the photo-oxidation and chemical reaction between Cu and the perovskite \nlayer[10,16].  Therefore, Au has been considered a logical choice of the electrode as it inherently \nprovides  resistance to environmental oxidation and appears also to be resistant to metal–halide \nformation, however diffusion of Au into the perovskite active layer can induce deep traps, \nleading to a degradation in performance[10,17,18]. Au is a relatively expensive material, which \ncan increase the overall cost of PSCs, making them less economically viable for large-scale \nproduction[19]. In this study, we present the incorporation of Ag-Cu-Zn alloy compositions, \nencompassing variants of Ag0.875Cu0.125Zn0.000, Ag0.875Cu0.120Zn0.005, and Ag0.875Cu0.115Zn0.010, \nas novel electrode materials. These alloys show excellent thermal and electrical conductivity \nand good reflectivity of light and present a cost-effective alternative to other precious electrode \nmetals. Ag-Cu-Zn alloy based back electrodes are less corrosive and less diffusive relative to \nAg electrodes and reduce the device degradation in the unencapsulated PSCs under ambient \nconditions.  \nIn this work, we report the innovative demonstration of thermal evaporation processing of Ag-\nCu-Zn alloy as a novel back electrode material for high-efficiency and long-term stable \nCs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3-based PSCs. The PSCs fabricated with Ag and Ag-Cu-\nZn electrodes are stored in the dark under ambient air conditions. Notably, PSCs with Ag \nelectrodes exhibit degradation with time, which is attributed to Ag corrosion, as evidenced by \nthe formation of silver iodide (AgI) confirmed through XRD and XPS analysis. In contrast, \nalloying Ag with Cu and Zn significantly reduce the corrosion rate of the electrodes, minimizes \nthe diffusion of Ag atoms into the perovskite layer, and consequently enhances device stability.  \n2. Experimental Section \nFigure 1 illustrates the schematic representation of the fabrication process of the Ag-Cu-Zn \nalloy back electrodes via the melt quenching technique followed by thermal evaporation. To \nprepare the Ag-Cu-Zn alloys, the appropriate amounts of Ag, Cu, and Zn powders were grinded, \nas described in Table S1 provided in the supporting information and then transferred into \ncleaned and flat quartz ampoules. The ampoules were subsequently sealed under a vacuum of \n10-6 mbar and loaded into a resistive furnace. The furnace temperature was initially ramped to \n350 °C and maintained for 3 hours, followed by a gradual increase to 700 °C. After a 3-hour \nisothermal hold at 700 °C, the temperature was further elevated to 1050 °C. To ensure sample \nhomogeneity, the ampoules were continuously rocked throughout the process. Following a 12-\nhour dwell at 1050 °C, the temperature was reduced to 800 °C, and the melt was rapidly \nquenched in an ice-water bath. Post-quenching, the Ag-Cu-Zn alloys were annealed at 250 °C \nto relieve stress and improve homogenization. \nTo fabricate the PSCs, the precursor solutions of SnO2, Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 \n(abbreviated as CsFAMA), and spiro-OMeTAD were prepared for the deposition of the electron \ntransport layer (ETL), active layer, and hole transport layer (HTL), respectively. The detailed \nprocedures for preparing these precursor solutions are outlined in the Methods section of the \nsupporting information. The step-by-step fabrication process utilized for the preparation of \nPSCs is illustrated in the schematic diagram presented in Figure S1. \nAfter optimization, when silver alloying with copper and Zinc, the composition of \nAg0.875Cu0.120Zn0.005 emerged as the most efficacious electrode material for PSCs. This alloy \n\n\n \n \n3 \n \nand its corresponding thin film/device are denoted as ACZ0.5/target, while fine silver serves as \nAg/control.  \n \nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of the fabrication of Ag-Cu-Zn alloy back electrodes. \n3. Results and Discussion \nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of both Ag and ACZ0.5 thin films were subjected to \nanalysis using the pseudo-Voigt function through the Rietveld refinement method. The Rietveld \nrefinement results for both thin films are depicted in Figure 2a,b. The results of the refinement \nfor fine silver confirm a face-centered cubic structure with a space group Fm-3m (No. 225) and \nunit cell parameters a=b=c=4.09 Å. In contrast, ACZ0.5 exhibits a crystalline structure with a \ntetragonal symmetry, characterized by a space group P4/mmm (No. 123) and lattice parameters \na=b=4.074 Å and c=8.148 Å, respectively. The observed peaks align well with the standard \nfiles and reported theoretical results[20]. The refinement outcomes, including reliability factors \nRP, RwP, Goodness of Fitting (GOF), R Bragg, χ2, RF, and lattice parameters for both samples, \nare summarized and tabulated in Table S2. Peak shifting and broadening can be seen in Ag thin \nfilms when alloyed with Cu and Zn (refer to Figure S2) and the corresponding crystal structures \nare illustrated in Figure S3. \nThe electronic structure and surface chemical compositions of Ag and the ACZ0.5 alloy were \ncharacterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS full survey of ACZ0.5 \nconfirms the presence of Ag, Cu and Zn elements (refer to Figure S4). The high-resolution \nXPS spectrum of Ag 3d illustrated in Figure 2c shows that ACZ0.5 comprises two distinct \npeaks at approximately 367 and 375 eV, corresponding to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, respectively. \nThe separation between these peaks is calculated to be 8.0 eV, confirming the Ag0 state[21]. The \nhigh-resolution XPS spectrum of Cu 2p depicted in Figure 2d shows that ACZ0.5 contains two \ndistinct peaks at approximately 933 and 953 eV, corresponding to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, \nrespectively. The separation between the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 peak is calculated to be 20.0 eV, \nwhich confirm the Cu0 state[22,23]. The high-resolution XPS of Zn 2p exhibits double peaks \nlocated at the binding energy of 1021 and 1045 eV with a spin–orbit splitting energy of 24 eV, \ncorresponding to the Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2, respectively, as shown in Figure 2e. The Zn 2p3/2 \npeak can be deconvoluted into two peaks centered at 1021 and 1022 eV, which can be assigned \nto Zn0 and Zn2+, respectively. Similarly, the Zn 2p1/2 peak can be deconvoluted into two peaks \ncentered at 1045 eV and 1046 eV[24,25]. The O 1s spectrum of ACZ0.5 alloy can be deconvoluted \ninto two peaks, as illustrated in Figure 2f, corresponding to the binding energy of Zn-O (530 \n\n\n \n \n4 \n \neV) and Zn-OH (532.5 eV) [25,26]. The formation of ZnO on the ACZ0.5 surface enhances the \ncorrosion resistance of the electrode. Raman spectra of Ag and its alloys also confirm the \nformation of ZnO on the surface (refer to Figure S5). The atomic ratio of Ag/Cu was calculated \nto be 6.9, which is close to the stoichiometric value, while the atomic concentration of Zn \ndecreases with depth. \n \nFigure 2.

In an ideal scenario, \nKPFM quantifies the Contact Potential Difference (CPD) between the metallic Atomic Force \nMicroscopy (AFM) tip and the sample, expressed by the relation[27]:  \nVCPD = (𝛷tip −𝛷sample) ⁄ e−                                                (1) \nHere, Φtip and Φsample denote the work functions of the sample and the tip, respectively, and e- \nrepresents the elementary charge. Figures 3a-f show the KPFM images, CPD profiles and \ncorresponding morphological mapping, including height profiles, for Highly Oriented Pyrolytic \nGraphite (HOPG), Ag, and ACZ0.5 alloy. To illustrate the work function, a Nanosensors PtIr-\nPPP-EFM probe, resonating at ca. 65.7 kHz, was employed to obtain CPD and corresponding \nmorphological mapping over each sample. HOPG was employed for the calibration of the tip \nwork function. The CPD of HOPG was determined to be 299 mV, as illustrated in Figure 3a, \nand the work function of HOPG was previously reported to be ~4.6 eV under environmental \nconditions, as cited in the preceding literature[27–29]. The absolute surface work function of the \nsample was calculated with the following equation[27]: \n𝛷sample = 4.6 eV + 𝑒−(𝑉CPDHOPG −𝑉CPDsample)                                (2) \n\n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nFigure 3.

EPMA analysis of \nACZ1.0 alloy sample on glass substrate: WDS mapping images showing elemental distribution: \n(g) Ag, (h) Cu, and (i) Zn.  \nWith the above information, the work function of the tip was calculated to be Φtip = 4.899 eV. \nThis value is consistent with previous reports[27]. The CPD values for Ag and ACZ0.5 alloy \nwere measured at 227 mV and 99 mV, as depicted in Figure 3b,c. Using Φtip and CPD values, \nthe work function values of fine silver and ACZ0.5 alloy were calculated to be ΦAg = 4.67 eV \nand ΦACZ0.5 = 4.80 eV, respectively. These values of work function are consistent with UPS \nanalysis (refer to Figure S6). Surface morphology images obtained through AFM for HOPG, \nAg, and ACZ0.5 alloy are shown in Figure 3d-f, respectively. Both Ag and ACZ0.5 alloy thin \nfilms exhibit similar morphologies, with roughness measurements of 1.3 nm and 1.4 nm, \nrespectively (refer to Figure S7).  \nElectron probe microanalysis (EPMA) was conducted to analyze the elemental distribution in \nthe alloy sample. The EPMA mapping results of ACZ1.0 in at% are shown in Figure 3g-i, and \ncorresponding area of map back-scattered electron (BSE) and secondary electron (SE) are \nshown in Figure S8. EPMA mapping indicates that the distributions of Ag, Cu, and Zn are \nuniform. The overall atomic fractions of Ag, Cu and Zn in the ACZ1.0 alloy were measured to \n\n\n \n \n6 \n \nbe 0.8625, 0.1256, and 0.0119, respectively, which is consistent with the theoretical \ncomposition of the ACZ1.0 alloy. These findings confirm that the alloy predominantly consists \nof a single phase. \nTo study of the moisture-induced degradation of electrodes with time, devices with architecture \nFTO/SnO2/CsFAMA/spiro-OMeTAD/electrode were fabricated as described in the Methods in \nthe supporting information. For this analysis, Ag and ACZ0.5 electrodes with precisely \ncontrolled thicknesses of approximately 8 nm (for XPS analysis) and 100 nm (for XRD \nanalysis) were deposited via thermal evaporation. We measured XRD and XPS for both the \nfreshly prepared samples and those subjected to aging for specific durations at a relative \nhumidity of 40% in the ambient air. The measurements were performed from the top electrode \nside to discern any alterations in the structural and chemical characteristics of the control and \ntarget devices, as illustrated in Figure 4a. \n \nFigure 4. (a) Schematic structure of the device with Ag/ACZ0.5 electrode, (b) XRD patterns \nof the device with Ag (control) electrode up to 90 days, (c) XRD patterns of the device with \nACZ0.05 (target) electrode up to 90 days, (d) Ag 3d XPS spectrum of the device with Ag \n(control) electrode up to 30 days, (e) Ag 3d XPS spectrum of the device with ACZ0.5 (target) \nelectrode up to 30 days, and (f) Cu 2p spectrum of the device with ACZ0.5 (target) electrode \nup to 30 days. \nXRD patterns exhibit variation as a function of time (see Figure 4b,c). Initially, it consisted of \ncombining XRD patterns from FTO, CsFAMA, Ag and ACZ0.5 for both control and target \ndevices (refer to Figure S9a,c, and Figure 2a,b). As time progressed, notable changes in the \nXRD patterns were observed, suggesting evolving structural characteristics within the \nCsFAMA film and electrodes. After 30 days, the control device stored in ambient air showed \nXRD peaks at 12.65, 25.55, 38.67 and 52.48°, which correspond to the crystallographic planes \nof PbI2, specifically (001), (002), (003) and (004), respectively (refer to Figure S9d). \n\n\n \n \n7 \n \nAdditionally, a peak at 23.80° was observed, which was indexed to the (002) crystallographic \nplane of AgI. Notably, this peak persisted with two new peaks at 22.68 and 39.46° in the XRD \npattern of the control device even after an extended storage period of 90 days in ambient \nair[12,21,30–32]. These peaks can be assigned to the (100) and (110) crystallographic plane of AgI, \nrespectively. Furthermore, one additional peak appeared at 11.32° after storage period of 90 \ndays, which corresponds to the (002) crystallographic planes of CsPb2Br5[33]. Similarly, the \nXRD analysis of the target device, stored under the same conditions, revealed the presence of \nidentical XRD peaks with storage period. Interestingly, no AgI peaks were seen after 30 days \nof storage. However, after 90 days, all three AgI peaks appeared. This observation suggests that \nthe ACZ0.5 alloy electrode exhibits enhanced stability compared to the Ag electrode.  \nOn the other hand, the fresh devices (FTO/SnO2/CsFAMA/spiro-OMeTAD/electrode) did not \nexhibit any discernible peaks corresponding to AgI (see Figure 4b,c). Both control and target \ndevices show notable peaks at 38.12 and 38.19˚, respectively, attributed to Ag (111) and \nACZ0.5 (112) crystallographic plane[12,32]. These peaks were observed continuously in both \ndevices stored for a period of 90 days at a relative humidity of 40% in ambient air. This \nobservation confirms that Ag was not converted completely to AgI after a storage period of 90 \ndays. \nTo investigate the degradation mechanism of electrodes over time, XPS analysis was conducted \non both devices for a duration of 30 days, as depicted in Figure 4d,e,f. Relatively a large amount \nof iodine and bromine were detected after storage period of 15 days and 30 days, respectively, \nin both control and target device (refer to Figure S12). This phenomenon is likely attributed to \nthe presence of pinholes in the spiro-OMeTAD films, enabling the detection of the underlying \nexposed perovskite layer. The Ag 3d XPS spectrum of fresh control device revealed two distinct \nand well-resolved peaks at 368.3 eV and 374.3 eV for Ag 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively (see \nFigure 4d). No noticeable peak shifting in Ag 3d XPS spectrum of fresh target device was \nobserved, as shown in Figure 4e. Additionally, the XPS spectrum of Cu 2p exhibited two \nprominent peaks at 952.8 eV and 933.0 eV for Cu 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively, with a separation \nof 19.8 eV between them (see Figure 4f). After storage period of 15 days, a notable observation \nwas made in the control device. The Ag 3d peaks clearly shift from a metallic state to a lower \nbinding energy. This shift is characteristic of the formation of AgI, as illustrated in Figure 4d. \nInterestingly, a similar shifting phenomenon in the target device was observed, but it occurred \nafter storage period of 30 days rather than 15 days, as depicted in Figure 4e. Further, a metallic \nto lower binding energy shifting in Cu 2p peaks was observed after a storage period of 30 days, \nwhich is the characteristics of CuI, as shown in Figure 4f. The formation of CuI at the spiro-\nOMeTAD/electrode interface facilitates hole transport[34,35]. These findings also confirm that \nACZ0.5 electrode is highly stable compared to Ag electrode. \nXRD and XPS analysis reveals that device degradation occurs in a two-step process. In the first \nstep, the CsFAMA layer undergoes degradation upon reacting with moisture, which penetrates \nthrough the pinholes present in the spiro-OMeTAD layer. During the second step, the degraded \nconstituents of CsFAMA, specifically PbI2, migrate through the spiro-OMeTAD layer and \nsubsequently react with Ag, leading to the formation of AgI through a diffusion process. The \nconceptual model of degradation of Ag electrode deposited on the FTO/SnO2/CsFAMA/spiro-\nOMeTAD is illustrated in Figure S13. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \nimages of the back electrodes of both the control and target devices, collected after 30 days, \nshow that the Ag electrode degrades more rapidly compared to the ACZ0.5 electrode (refer to \nFigure S14). This confirms that the ACZ0.5 electrode is more stable than the Ag electrode.  \n\n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nFigure 5. (a) Cross-sectional SEM image of PSCs, (b) Dark J–V characteristics of the control \nand target devices, (c) illuminated J–V measurement of control and target devices with reverse \nscan, (d) EQE and integrated current density curves, (e) the statistical distribution of the PCE \nand (f) stability measurements of control and target devices in the environment of 40 ± 5% \nhumidity (bottom) and which stored in N2 glove box (top). \nWe fabricated planar n–i–p  PSCs with configuration FTO/SnO2/CsFAMA/spiro-\nOMeTAD/electrode. Figure 5a shows a cross-sectional FE-SEM image of the PSC prepared \nby the solvent engineering method with CsFAMA as an active layer, SnO2 as an ETL and spiro-\nOMeTAD as an HTL. The PSC consisted of a uniform layer of SnO2 (~45 nm in thickness), a \nuniformly deposited CsFAMA layer (~340 nm in thickness) and a uniform layer of spiro-\nOMeTAD (~200 nm in thickness). We prepared PSCs with Ag and ACZ0.5 as a back electrode \n(~95 nm thick) for the control and target device, respectively. SEM image, absorption spectra, \nsteady-state photoluminescence spectra, and time-resolved photoluminescence profiles of \nCsFAMA thin film are shown in Figure S11. The energy band diagram of the PSCs is shown \nin Figure S15[36,37]. \nDark current-voltage characteristics, as illustrated in Figure 5b, were used to investigate the \neffect of the spiro-OMeTAD/electrode interface on the recombination nature in the device. The \ntarget device shows a lower leakage current (6.3 × 10−6 mA/cm2) than the Ag electrode-based \ndevice (3.3 × 10−5 mA/cm2) indicating the degraded recombination at the spiro-OMeTAD/Ag \ninterface[38,39].  The reduction in leakage current observed in the target device can be attributed \nto improved chemical stability, better adhesion, and reduced diffusion of silver ions into the \nperovskite layer. In Figure 5c, the photocurrent density-voltage (J–V) characteristics of the \nPSCs fabricated with the ACZ0.5 electrode as target device are compared with those of the \ncontrol device prepared with the Ag electrode. As shown in the J–V curves, the target device \nexhibited an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.12 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.39 \nmA/cm2, and a fill factor (FF) of 72.5%, giving an maximum PCE of 19.02%, whereas the \ncontrol device showed an overall PCE of 18.71% with a VOC of 1.08 V, a JSC of 23.17 mA/cm2, \nand a FF of 74.8%. The superior performance of the target device is mainly attributed to a \nhigher VOC, which is associated with beneficial effects such as electronic structure modification \nand chemical stability of the ACZ0.5 electrode. The lower FF of the target device may be \nattributed to the higher sheet resistance (0.012 ohm/sq for Ag and 0.425 ohm/sq for ACZ0.5) \n\n\n \n \n9 \n \nof the ACZ0.5 electrode compared to the Ag electrode. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) \nof the control and target devices was tested, as shown in Figure 5d. The results reveal that the \ntarget device shows a good optical response with a higher EQE and an integrated current density \nof 21.78 mA/cm2, while the control device exhibits an integrated current density of 21.30 \nmA/cm2. The statistical distribution diagram of the PCE of the PSCs is shown in Figure 5e and \nthe J–V data of 28 devices is shown in Table S3, and the PCE results exhibit that the PSCs with \nACZ0.5 electrodes show good reproducibility and better photovoltaic performance. Time-\nstability plots of the PSCs are shown in Figure 5f. The control device, stored in the environment \nof 40 ± 5% humidity loses 20% of its efficiency after 180 hours, whereas the target device takes \n310 hours to experience the same level of efficiency loss. The PCE of  the control device, stored \nin the N2 glove box, decreases to 80% of its initial value after 320 hours, while the PCE of the \ntarget device retains over 80% of its initial value after 460 h. These findings indicate that the \ntarget device exhibits superior stability, particularly in terms of moisture stability. \n4. Conclusions \nThe ACZ0.5 alloy-based back electrode demonstrates remarkable potential for use in PSCs due \nto its excellent chemical stability, good reflectivity of light, and high adhesion on the hole \ntransport layer. Our findings demonstrate that PSCs incorporating the ACZ0.5 alloy electrode \nexhibit significantly enhanced durability compared to those utilizing Ag metal electrodes, \nparticularly in unencapsulated devices. Additionally, these cells achieve high efficiency, and a \nlarger open-circuit voltage than traditional Ag electrodes. These attributes make the ACZ0.5 \nalloy-based electrode a promising candidate for photovoltaic applications, paving the way for \nmore reliable, cost-effective and efficient solar energy solutions. Further research and \ndevelopment could enhance its performance and broaden its applicability in the renewable \nenergy sector. \nSupporting Information.  \nSupporting Information is available with this paper. \nCorresponding Author \nRamesh Karuppannan – Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), \nBangalore 560012, Karnataka, India;  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8304-6500; Email: \nkramesh@iisc.ac.in  \nAuthors \nKeshav Kumar Sharma – Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore \n560012, Karnataka, India; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6753-2269  \nAshutosh Ujjwal – Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore \n560012, Karnataka, India; https://orcid.org/0009-0001-7786-4179  \nRohit Saini – Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore 560012, \nKarnataka, India; https://orcid.org/0009-0000-7004-0401  \nAuthor Contributions \nK.

Fluorine-doped tin oxide \n(FTO, 7 Ω/sq.) and Hellmanex III were also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Fine silver (Ag, \n99.9%), Copper (99.9%) and Zinc (98%) were purchased from commercial sources.  \n \n1.2 SnO2 precursor solution \nThe precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 31.5 mg of SnCl4.5H2O in 1 mL absolute \nethanol. 20.5 μL of acacH was added as chelating at room temperature to the solution to yield \n[acacH] [Sn]\n⁄\n> 2. In the presence of an excess of acacH, the hydrolytic stability of the tin-\nacac-chelate complex increases, preventing the progress of further condensation reaction. The \nnominal hydrolysis ratio of alcoholic solution prepared from SnCl4.5H2O (ℎ= [H2O] [Sn]\n⁄\n=\n5) was adjusted by dropwise addition of 162 μL of DI water to yield  ℎ= [H2O] [Sn]\n⁄\n= 105. \nThe solution was stirred at 70 ˚C for 2 hrs, giving rise to transparent and stable colloidal \nsolution[1,2].  \n1.3 Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 precursor solution \nA solution was prepared by dissolving 507.1 mg of PbI2 and 73.4 mg of PbBr2 in 1 mL of \nanhydrous DMF and DMSO in a 4:1 (v/v) ratio, stirring at 100 °C for 30 minutes. After cooling, \n172 mg of FAI, 22.4 mg of MABr, and 53 μL of a CsI solution (1.5 M in DMSO) were added \nto the inorganic solution to create the perovskite precursor solution. The precursor solution was \nthen stirred at room temperature for 6 hrs[3]. \n1.4 Spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution \nA solution of spiro-OMeTAD precursor was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, \n17.5 μL of Li-TFSI solution (520 mg in 1 mL ACN), and 28.8 μL of t-BP in 1 mL of CB[3].  \n1.5 Ag-Cu-Zn alloy preparation  \n\n\n \n \n13 \n \nTo prepare the back electrode, silver, copper, and zinc metals were utilized in the specified \ncompositions, as detailed in the table below: \n \nTable S1.

Subsequently, the \nFTO glasses were subjected to UV ozone cleaning for 30 minutes before being used. A compact \nlayer of SnO2 was prepared by spin coating of SnO2 precursor solution at 3000 RPM for 30 \nsecs on FTO glass, followed by annealing at 145 ˚C for 1 hr. After cooling down, it was UV \nozone treated for 30 minutes before being used. The perovskite precursor solution was applied \non FTO/SnO2 layer through a two-step spin-coating process. In the first step, the coating was \nperformed at 1000 RPM for 10 secs with a ramping rate of 500 RPM/sec. Subsequently, in the \nsecond step, the spin-coating process was carried out at 6000 RPM for 20 secs with a ramping \nrate of 2000 RPM/sec. During the second step, 200 μL of CB was poured onto the spinning \nsubstrate 5 secs prior to the end of spinning program, followed by the annealing at 110 ˚C for 1 \nhr on the hotplate. 20 μL of spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated upon the perovskite layer \nat 500 RPM for 3 secs, and 3000 RPM for 30 secs. Finally, the devices were completed by \nthermal evaporation of ~100 nm thick fine silver and silver-copper-zinc alloys. The deposition \nrate during this process was set at 1 to 5 Å/sec under high vacuum (6.5×10-6 mbar). The active \narea of the devices, amounting to 0.09 cm2, was defined using an evaporation mask. \n1.7 Solar cell characterization  \nThe current-voltage (J–V) characteristics of the unencapsulated solar cells were measured using \na Keithley 2400 instrument. The measurement involved a forward scan from -0.5 V to 1.5 V at \na scanning rate of 50 mV/s, with a voltage step of 10 mV and a delay time of 50 ms. The \nmeasurements were conducted under ambient conditions and illuminated with AM1.5G light at \nan intensity of 100 mW/cm2 from a solar simulator (Newport). The solar simulator was \ncalibrated using a standard silicon solar cell device.   \n1.8 X-rays diffraction (XRD) \nXRD measurements were conducted using a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer that was \nequipped with a copper Kα anode. The diffractometer operated at a tube output voltage of 45 \nkV and a current of 30 mA. Single scans were performed within the angular range of 10˚ to 80˚ \nusing Bragg's angle, and the measurements were carried out in parallel beam (PB) geometry. \n1.9 Raman spectroscopy \nRaman spectra were obtained using a LabRAM HR evolution Raman microscope. A 532 nm \nargon ion laser was used as an excitation source for spectroscopic measurements.  \n1.10 \nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) \n\n\n \n \n14 \n \nThe surface and cross-sectional morphologies of perovskite films deposited on SnO2/FTO \nsubstrates were characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, \nZEISS Ultra55, Mono Carl Zeiss). The perovskite films were fabricated following the same \nprotocols employed in solar cell production. \n1.11 \nAtomic Force Microscopy (AFM) \nThe surface morphologies and localized work functions of back electrode films were \ncharacterized using AFM with a Park NX20 system in Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) \nmode. A PtIr-PPP-EFM probe was employed as the scanning probe microscopy (SPM) probe. \n1.12 \nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) \nChemistry of electrode degradation was examined by Thermo Scientific XPS/UPS system using \nan Al Kα (λ = 0.83 nm, hυ = 1486.7 eV). X-ray source was operated at 23.5 W, and the data \nwere analyzed using CasaXPS software. \n1.13 \nUltraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) \nThe work functions of thin films were calculated by Thermo-Scientific XPS/UPS system in \nUPS mode. UV photons are produced using a gas discharge lamp, typically filled with helium. \nHe-I line having the energy of 21.22 eV was used for the spectroscopic measurements.  \n1.14 \nUV-Visible-NIR spectroscopy \nThe absorbance, transmittance, and reflectance spectra of thin films were collected by \nPerkinElmer LAMBDA 1050+ UV-Vis-NIR spectrometers. Aluminum coated glass was used \nas a reference for reflectance.  \n2. Device Fabrication \n \nFigure S1.

The Ag Raman spectrum consists of vibrational mode at \n239, 883, 1287, 1359, and 1606 𝑐𝑚−1. In the Raman spectra of Ag, the band observed at 239 \ncm-1,  is due to 𝐴𝑔−𝑂 stretching mode[4,5], the vibrational peak observed at 883 cm-1 arises \ndue to 𝐴𝑔−𝑂 interaction through the hydrophilic part of carboxylic group[6,7]. The other band \nobserved at 1287, 1359, and 1606 cm-1 are arise due to carboxylic symmetric and anti-\nsymmetric 𝐶= 𝑂 stretching vibration of carboxylic group, respectively[4,6]. The Raman \nspectrum of ACZ0.0 reveals a new mode at 617 𝑐𝑚−1, associated with the bending of 𝐶−𝑂 \nbonds[8,9], while the 239 𝑐𝑚−1 mode of 𝐴𝑔−𝑂 has vanish. The Raman spectra of ACZ0.5 and \nACZ1.0 exhibit a new mode at 998 𝑐𝑚−1, wherein the 𝐶−𝑂 bending mode at 617 𝑐𝑚−1 has \nceased to be observed. This mode is associated with 2TO (transverse-optical) vibration mode \nof wurtzite ZnO[10,11], which confirms the formation of ZnO on the surface of thin films.  \n \nFigure S5.

The determination of the energy \nassociated with the secondary electron cutoff (SECO) entails an examination of the UPS \nspectrum when plotted in relation to the Fermi level. Assuming that Fermi level alignment is \npreserved between the spectrometer and the sample surface, the work function of the sample \nsurface is given by[12] \nϕ = hν −SECO                                                                                                                    (1) \nEquation (1) is certainly valid for a metal’s surface or for an adsorbate on a conducting substrate. \nThe work functions of Ag and ACZ0.5 are calculated to be 4.61 eV and 4.93 eV, respectively, \nas shown in Figure S6a,b.  \n\n\n \n \n17 \n \n \nFigure S6.

{"text": "Unmasking Stealthy Attacks on Nonlinear DAE Models of Power Grids\nAbdallah Alalem Albustamia, Ahmad F. Tahaa, Elias Bou-Harbb\naVanderbilt University, Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, Nashville, 37235, TN, US\nbLouisiana State University, Division of Computer Science and Engineering, Baton Rouge, 70803, LA, US\nAbstract\nSmart grids are inherently susceptible to various types of malicious cyberattacks that have all been documented in the\nrecent literature. Traditional cybersecurity research on power systems often utilizes simplified models that fail to capture\nthe interactions between dynamic and steady-state behaviors, potentially underestimating the impact of cyber threats.\nThis paper presents the first attempt to design and assess stealthy false data injection attacks (FDIAs) against nonlinear\ndifferential algebraic equation (NDAE) models of power networks. NDAE models, favored in industry for their ability\nto accurately capture both dynamic and steady-state behaviors, provide a more accurate representation of power system\nbehavior by coupling dynamic and algebraic states. We propose novel FDIA strategies that simultaneously evade both\ndynamic and static intrusion detection systems while respecting the algebraic power flow and operational constraints\ninherent in NDAE models. We demonstrate how the coupling between dynamic and algebraic states in NDAE models\nsignificantly restricts the attacker’s ability to manipulate state estimates while maintaining stealthiness. This highlights\nthe importance of using more comprehensive power system models in cybersecurity analysis and reveals potential vul-\nnerabilities that may be overlooked in simplified representations. The proposed attack strategies are validated through\nsimulations on the IEEE 39-bus system.\nKeywords:\nFalse data injection attack, power system nonlinear differential algebraic model, dynamic state estimation.\n1. Introduction\nIn recent years, the pervasive adoption of information\ntechnology has elevated cybersecurity to a critical issue\nfor contemporary power systems.\nThe close intercon-\nnection between the physical and cyber dimensions of\nthese systems suggests that a compromise in cybersecu-\nrity could pose a significant risk to their physical integrity\n[1]. A particularly insidious threat within this domain is\nStealthy False Data Injection Attacks (SAs).2 In partic-\nular, SAs have the capability to manipulate state estima-\ntion processes—that are instrumental in obtaining system-\nwide situational awareness and inform subsequent con-\ntrol actions—while evading conventional detection mecha-\nnisms, thereby threatening the stability and reliability of\nsmart grids [2].\nExtensive research has been dedicated to the exploration\nof SAs against modern power systems, spanning the con-\nstruction of valid attack strategies, assessing the impact\nEmail addresses:\nabdallah.b.alalem.albustami@vanderbilt.edu (Abdallah Alalem\nAlbustami), ahmad.taha@vanderbilt.edu (Ahmad F. Taha),\nebouharb@lsu.edu (Elias Bou-Harb)\n1This work is supported by National Science Foundation under\nGrants 2230087 and 2404946.\n2We refer to these attacks by SAs, in contrast to the more verbose\nacronym SFDIAs used in the literature. We note that not all SAs\nare false data injection attacks, but the SAs considered in this paper\nare presumed to fall within the class of FDIAs.\nof attacks on system stability, and developing defense and\nmitigation strategies [2]. The design and mitigation of SAs\ncan be broadly categorized into three categories [3]: (i)\nthose leveraging power flow equations (either DC or AC)\nto devise attack vectors [4] and hence targeting steady-\nstate grid conditions; (ii) those exploiting the system’s ar-\nchitectural vulnerabilities, including both centralized and\ndecentralized attack schemes [5, 6]; (iii) those predicated\non the methodology of construction, ranging from at-\ntacks informed by complete or partial system topology—\nleveraging knowledge of the physical and logical layout of\nthe power grid—as in [7, 8] to data-driven strategies that\nrequire no a priori knowledge of the grid’s dynamics or\nparameters [9–11].\nIn addressing SAs, two critical routines underpin the\nresilience of these infrastructures: state estimation (SE)\nand intrusion detection (ID) [2]. State estimation is the\nprocess for inferring the grid’s current state from mea-\nsurements, essential for decision-making and monitoring.\nIntrusion detection works in tandem, discerning genuine\nsystem changes from erroneous or malicious data, hence\nsafeguarding the state estimation process against potential\nanomalies [3]. Significant efforts have been dedicated to\ndeveloping and detecting stealthy data integrity attacks to\ncompromise SE. This is a centerfold of most attack detec-\ntion algorithms as most of them rely on computing resid-\nuals between predicted system state and estimated one.\nThese attacks can be bounded, with limitations on their\nAccepted to International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, February 2025\nMarch 3, 2025\narXiv:2502.21146v1  [eess.SY]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\nimpact [12], or unbounded thereby offering wider scope\nfor disruption [13]. Moreover, they can be meticulously\ntailored to create a worst-case scenario by exploiting the\nvulnerabilities of specific intrusion detectors [14, 15].\nKey Research Gap. Despite extensive research, a crit-\nical gap exists in analyzing SAs against power systems\nmodeled with Nonlinear Differential Algebraic Equations\n(NDAE). NDAE models, which are widely favored in in-\ndustry for their ability to accurately represent both dy-\nnamic and steady-state behaviors of power systems [16],\noffer several advantages over simplified linearized or Non-\nlinear ODE (NODE) models:\n• More accurate representation of power system dynam-\nics, capturing interactions between generator dynamic\nstates (e.g., rotor angles, speeds, and transient voltages)\nand network algebraic constraints that model steady-\nstate power flow behavior. This coupling allows for a\nmore realistic simulation of system response to distur-\nbances and control actions [17, 18].\n• Capacity to model expanded Phasor Measurement Unit\n(PMU) deployment across various bus types (e.g., load,\nrenewable), extending beyond the generator-bus limita-\ntions of ODE models, potentially improving SE accuracy\nand fault detection [19, 20].\n• Continuous validation of state estimates against alge-\nbraic power flow and power balance constraints, improv-\ning the detection of measurement errors, model inaccu-\nracies, and potential cyberattacks by identifying incon-\nsistencies between the system’s dynamic behavior and\ninstantaneous power flow solutions.\nThese advantages can significantly impact SA analysis:\n• Formulation: NDAE models present attackers with a\nmultifaceted challenge. They must design attack vec-\ntors that simultaneously: (1) keep detection residuals\nbelow established thresholds to evade conventional in-\ntrusion detectors, (2) ensure adherence to nonlinear al-\ngebraic constraints to maintain physical plausibility of\nthe compromised system state, and (3) ensure the per-\nturbed system remains observable and the state estima-\ntion process converges to a solution.\n• Detection and Mitigation:\nThe interdependence be-\ntween dynamic and algebraic states in NDAE models\nenables multi-modal anomaly detection. Discrepancies\nbetween the temporal evolution of dynamic states and\nthe instantaneous algebraic constraints can reveal subtle\nattack signatures not apparent in decoupled or simpli-\nfied models.\n• Attack Analysis: NDAE models allow for a unified eval-\nuation of how attacks on PMU measurement affect both\ndynamic states and steady-state variables, providing in-\nsights into both transient stability issues and steady-\nstate constraint violations that may be overlooked in\ndecoupled analyses.\nThe lack of research in this area necessitates an in-depth\ninvestigation to gauge the susceptibility of NDAE-modeled\npower systems to SAs and the development of NDAE-\nspecific detection and mitigation strategies. What follows\nis a detailed delineation of the literature that closely re-\nlates to this key gap of SA design and impact assessment\non NDAE power system models.\nRelevant Literature. Previous research on SAs against\npower systems has primarily focused on simplified models\nthat may not fully capture the complex nonlinear dynam-\nics and interactions present in real-world power grids. For\ninstance, in [21] and [22], the authors investigate SAs using\nlinearized descriptor (another more mathematical phrase\nused to describe DAEs) systems. They employ a basic Bad\nData Detection (BDD) scheme for intrusion detection and\nuse an observer-based approach for SE. They define a per-\nfect attack as one that satisfies certain detection avoidance\nand state divergence conditions, but they do not consider\nhow the resulting state estimates must satisfy the algebraic\nconstraints inherent in DAE models. Furthermore, their\nuse of linearized models may not adequately capture the\nnonlinear behavior of power systems, potentially overlook-\ning vulnerabilities that arise from the interaction between\ndynamic and algebraic states.\nMore recent studies, such as [23], [24], and [25], have\nshifted focus to FDIAs in nonlinear settings.\nHowever,\nthese works primarily address static power flow models,\noptimizing attack sparsity and detection or leveraging deep\nlearning for forecasting-based anomaly detection.\nThey\ndo not consider the coupled dynamic and algebraic com-\nponents present in real systems, leaving a critical gap in\nunderstanding vulnerabilities arising from these interac-\ntions.\nStudies like [26] and [27] have explored the inherent vul-\nnerabilities of AC state estimation to false data injection\nattacks, with the former leveraging physical system prop-\nerties for defense and the latter assessing physical disrup-\ntions from a bi-level optimization perspective. A signifi-\ncant body of work has also focused on constructing SAs\nagainst the AC state estimation process, which captures\nthe algebraic constraints governing the steady-state be-\nhavior of power systems [28–31]. While these studies con-\ntribute to our understanding of system vulnerabilities un-\nder stealthy attack scenarios that exploit the algebraic con-\nstraints of steady-state behavior, they overlook dynamic\nsystem components, such as generator dynamics, and their\ninteraction with the algebraic power flow equations. As a\nresult, the impact of SAs designed using these approaches\nmay not be fully representative of the actual system re-\nsponse when both dynamic and algebraic components are\nsimultaneously considered.\nTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper\npresents the first attempt to design and assess SAs against\nNDAE models of power systems that simultaneously ac-\ncount for generator dynamic behaviors and algebraic con-\nstraints that model steady-state power flow.\nInvestigated Research Questions.\nThis paper ad-\n2\n\n\ndresses this gap by investigating the following research\nquestions:\n• Q1.\nHow does incorporating NDAE models influence\nthe formulation, detection, and impact of SAs?\nAre\nthere notable limitations and consequences when sim-\nplified models are employed to analyze and detect SAs\nin power systems?\n• Q2. How does the effectiveness of different mainstream\nintrusion detectors differ in detecting SAs for NDAE-\nmodeled power systems? What improvements are nec-\nessary to enhance their detection capabilities?\n• Q3.\nHow do NDAE-specific state monitoring algo-\nrithms, when coupled with dynamic intrusion detection\nmethods, perform against tailored SAs?\nPaper Objectives and Contributions.\nThis study\nexamines attack strategies on NDAE-modeled power sys-\ntems.\nWe categorize attacks into two main strategies.\n(i) Constraint-Unaware Attacks:\nThis strategy focuses\non attacks that manipulate PMU measurements to re-\nmain undetected by intrusion detection systems but do\nnot consider the adherence to the system’s algebraic con-\nstraints, potentially leading to implausible physical con-\nditions in the simulated attacks.\n(ii) Constraint-Aware\nAttacks: Here, stealthy attacks are designed to adhere to\nboth detection evasion and the algebraic and operational\nconstraints, ensuring attacks are both physically plausible\nand stealthy. The contributions of this paper are threefold:\n1. Development of NDAE-aware SA strategies that ensure\nthe resulting state estimates, encompassing both gen-\nerator dynamics and steady-state variables, simultane-\nously satisfy the algebraic constraints of DAE models\nwhile remaining stealthy to intrusion detection. This\napproach captures the inherent coupling between dy-\nnamic and algebraic states, presenting a more com-\nprehensive attack model than those considering only\nsteady-state behavior. Specifically, we introduce an It-\nerative Constraint-Aware Attack Algorithm (ICAA), an\nefficient and scalable method for refining attack vec-\ntors to satisfy physical constraints while evading de-\ntection.\nICAA begins with initial attack vectors de-\nsigned to bypass detection thresholds (referred to as\nconstraint-unaware attacks, as they do not consider\nphysical system constraints) and systematically adjusts\nthem to ensure physical plausibility, avoiding the need\nfor direct solution of the NDAE model or complex op-\ntimization procedures, making ICAA computationally\ntractable for large-scale power systems.\n2. Evaluation of attack impacts on NDAE-specific state\nestimation and intrusion detection, comparing CUSUM\nand Chi-squared detector performance against the pro-\nposed attacks.

The rest of the paper is organized\nas follows. Section 2 includes the preliminaries. Section 3\npresents the attack strategies. Case studies are presented\nin Section 4, and the paper is concluded in Section 6.\n2. Preliminaries\nThis section summarizes the NDAE model, state esti-\nmation methods, and basic intrusion detectors critical for\nunderstanding and implementing the proposed algorithms.\n2.1. Power Network NDAE Model\nPower systems can be modeled using a set of Nonlin-\near Differential Algebraic Equations (NDAE) that capture\nboth the dynamic behavior of generators and the algebraic\npower flow constraints of the network. The NDAE model\ntakes the following general form:\nGen. Dynamics: ˙xd = Adxd + fd(xd, xa) + Bdu\n(1a)\nFlow Constraints: 0 = Aaxa + fa(xd, xa) + Baw.\n(1b)\nHere, xd represents the dynamic state variables asso-\nciated with generators, while xa represents the algebraic\nstate variables related to power flow in the network. The\nfunctions fd and fa capture the nonlinearities present in\nthe generator dynamics and power flow equations respec-\ntively. Incorporating PMU measurements, represented by\na vector y ∈Rp of voltage and current phasors into the\nNDAE model, results in:\nE ˙x = Ax + f(x) + Buu + Bww + wp,\n(2a)\ny = Cx + wm.\n(2b)\nThe output matrix C ∈Rp×n links state vectors to PMU\ndata via their geographic placements, with wm ∈Rp and\nwp ∈Rn representing random measurement and process\nnoise.\nFor a complete and detailed description of the NDAE\nmodel, including the specific algebraic equations for power\nflow and power balance, please refer to Appendix A.\n2.2. NDAE State Estimation for Attack Detection\nIn the context of NDAE-modeled power systems, SE\nbecomes particularly challenging due to the presence of\nboth dynamic and algebraic states.\nSome methods in\nthe literature simplify this task by reducing the model\nto NODE form or neglecting the algebraic constraints,\ncompromising system representation fidelity [17]. Incor-\nporating algebraic constraints into the state estimation\n3\n\n\nprocess for NDAE models can be accomplished through\ntwo primary approaches: a decoupled two-step approach\nand a coupled joint estimation approach. The decoupled\napproach first estimates algebraic variables using static\nSE techniques (such as Least Absolute Value estimation),\nthen derives dynamic state estimates using dynamic es-\ntimation methods (such as the Extended Kalman Filter)\n[32, 33].\nFor the purpose of this work, we utilize the\njoint SE approach, which simultaneously estimates both\ndynamic and algebraic states, as it has demonstrated\nsuperior accuracy in capturing the interactions between\ndynamic and algebraic states in NDAE models, particu-\nlarly in the presence of process and measurement noise,\nas well as uncertainties from loads and renewable energy\nsources [20].\nJoint NDAE Observer.\nIn [20], the authors in-\ntroduce an observer that jointly estimates the dynamic\nand algebraic states of a NDAE-modeled power network\nusing a Lyapunov-based, control-theoretic approach. The\nobserver and error dynamics are given by:\nE ˙ˆx = Aˆx + f(x) + Buu + Bww + L(y −ˆy),\n(3a)\nZ ˙e = (A −LC)e + ∆f + (Bw −LDw)w.\n(3b)\nThe observer gain matrix L is determined through solving\na convex semidefinite program problem that ensures that\nthe error dynamics are bounded, hence guaranteeing that\nthe state estimates are close to the actual system states\nunder the presence of uncertainty from loads, renewables,\nand process and measurement noise.\n2.3. Intrusion Detection\nTo analyze the impact of SAs on NDAE-modeled\npower systems, we employ two well-established residual-\nbased intrusion detection methods: the Cumulative Sum\n(CUSUM) detector [34] and the Chi-squared (χ2) detector\n[35]. These detectors are chosen for their proven effective-\nness in power system security and their compatibility with\nthe utilized NDAE model [36–38].\n2.3.1. CUSUM Detection\nThe Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) detector is a dynamic\ndetection method that monitors changes in the cumulative\nsum of residuals, r ∈Rp, defined as the differences between\nthe state estimates from the SE step (3) and the noisy\nmeasurements obtained from PMUs (2b):\nr(t) = y(t) −C ˆx(t).\n(4)\nThe CUSUM detection process is defined as:\nc1 = 0, ck =\n(\nmax (0, ck−1 + zk −b) ,\nif ck−1 ≤τ,\n0 and ˆk = k −1,\nif ck−1 > τ.\n(5)\nThe parameters to be set are the bias b ∈R>0 and the\nthreshold τ ∈R>0. The output is the alarm time(s) ˆk. An\nalarm is triggered when the test sequence ck−1 exceeds a\npredefined threshold τ, and ck is set to zero. The param-\neters b and τ are critical design choices that control the\nsensitivity and detection threshold of the CUSUM detec-\ntor. While [39] outlines a theoretical approach for tuning\nb and τ, this work employs a practical methodology based\non analyzing historical residual data to tune these param-\neters.\nThe choice of the distance measure zk depends on the\nconfiguration of the CUSUM detectors in the system.\nWhen using a scalar distance measure that aggregates\ninformation from all residuals, such as zk = r⊤\nk Σ−1rk,\nthe CUSUM parameters (b, τ, and ck) are also scalars.\nThis centralized approach monitors all residuals collec-\ntively, treating the entire set of measurements as a sin-\ngle unit. In contrast, if the distance measure is a vector,\nsuch as using the residual vector rk itself or its absolute\nvalues |rk|, then the CUSUM parameters become vectors\n(b, τ, ck ∈Rp). This vectorized approach monitors each\nmeasurement’s residual separately, allowing for different\nsensitivity for each measurement. This effectively provides\na distributed detection capability within a single CUSUM\nframework as it allows to to detect localized anomalies to\nindividual measurements.\nThe CUSUM detector offers several advantages over tra-\nditional static detection methods, such as BDD. Unlike\nstatic methods which typically rely on single-shot residual\nanalysis to flag anomalies, CUSUM dynamically tracks cu-\nmulative changes in residuals over time, making it more\nsensitive to subtle, persistent deviations introduced by\nstealthy attacks. Additionally, it is computationally effi-\ncient and straightforward to implement, as it requires only\nresidual computations and simple iterative updates. This\nmakes it a practical choice for real-time applications.\n2.3.2. Chi-squared (χ2) Detector\nThe Chi-squared detector is a static detection mecha-\nnism designed to identify sudden anomalies in the resid-\nuals. Considering the residual vector (4), the chi-squared\nprocedure is defined as:\nzk = r⊤\nk Σ−1rk\n(6)\nAn alarm is triggered when zk exceeds a predefined thresh-\nold α. This threshold is set using the inverse regularized\nlower incomplete gamma function P −1(·, ·). Specifically,\nα is calculated as α = 2P −1 \u0000 ny\n2 , 1 −1\nm\n\u0001\n, where ny is the\nnumber of independent measurements, and m represents\nthe desired mean time between false alarms [39]. The χ2\ndetector (also referred to as BDD) is widely used in FDIA\nresearch due to its effectiveness in identifying significant\ndeviations indicative of malicious injections.\nNext, we present two attack strategies designed to by-\npass the aforementioned intrusion detection systems, each\naccounting for different levels of system constraints.\n4\n\n\n3. Attack Strategies\nIn this section, we propose two attack strategies to\nevaluate whether the strict physical and operational con-\nstraints inherent in NDAE models—due to the coupling\nof dynamic and algebraic variables—make it more diffi-\ncult for adversaries to evade SE and ID systems.\nWe\ndefine two types of attacks: (i) Constraint-Unaware At-\ntacks (SCUAs), which aim to bypass ID methods with-\nout adhering to algebraic constraints.\nWe formulate\nthese attacks to explore their feasibility on the SE pro-\ncess of NDAE-modeled power systems when constraints\nare neglected, providing insights into applying similar at-\ntacks on simplified models that disregard grid physics.\n(ii) Constraint-Aware Attacks (SCAAs), which maintain\nstealthiness against both ID systems and the NDAE con-\nstraints, ensuring the physical plausibility of the attacked\nstate estimates. We point out here that these two prob-\nlems have not been studied in the literature for NDAE-\nmodeled power systems, although they do sound intuitive\nand meaningful as outlined in Section 1. The effectiveness\nof both attack strategies is validated in Section 4. Before\ndetailing each strategy, we clarify key definitions used in\nattack formulation:\n• Attack Vector (a(k) ∈Rp): A vector that represents the\nmanipulations applied to measurements at time k.\n• Measurement Selection Matrix (Γ ∈Rp×p): A diagonal\nmatrix where the i-th diagonal element is 1 if the i-th\nmeasurement is targeted by the attack, and 0 otherwise.\nThis matrix defines which measurements are targeted by\na(k).\n• Attack start time (k∗): Scalar defining the time step of\nattack initiation.\n• Attacked Measurements (y∗(k) ∈Rp): The measure-\nments obtained by adding the attack vector, scaled by\nthe measurement selection matrix, to the true measure-\nments at time step k, i.e., y∗(k) = y(k) + Γa(k).\n3.1. Stealthy Constraint-Unaware Attacks (SCUAs)\nStealthy Constraint-Unaware Attacks (SCUAs) are at-\ntacks designed to exploit vulnerabilities in ID systems\nby maximizing the injected false data while maintaining\ndetector outputs at their predefined thresholds, without\nconsidering the algebraic and operational constraints of\nNDAE models. Below, we outline worst-case stealthy at-\ntack strategies for both detectors reproduced in Section\n2.3, building on established methods from the literature\n[14, 40].\n3.1.1. SCUA formulation for CUSUM\nThe CUSUM statistic under a stealthy injection attack\nconsidering a distance measure zk = r⊤\nk Σ−1rk and a single\nCUSUM statistic for all measurements is represented as:3\nck = max\n\u00000, ck−1 + (Σ−0.5(rk + ak))2 −b\n\u0001\n(7)\nAn attack sequence, ak, that can neutralize the residuals\nand maintain ck at its threshold can be defined as follows\n[39]:\nak =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nΣ\n1\n2 Γ\n\u0012q\nτ+b−ck−1\nn\n, . . . ,\nq\nτ+b−ck−1\nn\n\u0013⊤\n−rk,\nif k = k∗\nΣ\n1\n2 Γ\n\u0012q\nb\nn, . . . ,\nq\nb\nn\n\u0013⊤\n−rk,\nif k > k∗.\n(8)\nThe matrix Γ selects the n measurements targeted by\nthe attacker, where n corresponds to the number of ones on\nthe diagonal of Γ (i.e., number of selected measurements).\nThis enables the attacker to spread the impact across any\nn selected measurements based on their access to PMU\ndata, while still keeping the overall CUSUM statistic at\nthe desired threshold.\nIn the case of considering a distance measure zk = |rk|,\nwhere ck = max (0, ck−1 + |rk + ak| −b), the attack vec-\ntor ak can be designed to selectively target specific mea-\nsurements to keep the CUSUM statistic ck at desired lev-\nels. The attack sequence, ak can be defined as follows [14]:\nak,i =\n(\n±(τi + bi −ck−1,i) −rk,i,\nif k = k∗,\nbi −rk,i,\nif k > k∗,\n(9)\nwhere i = 1, 2, . . . , p represents each individual measure-\nment. Here, the attacker must know the specific param-\neters of the CUSUM statistic for each targeted measure-\nment.\nBy selecting which measurements to attack and\nadjusting the magnitude of the injection based on this in-\nformation, the attacker can maintain the CUSUM statis-\ntic ck(i) for each targeted measurement i at its respective\nthreshold τ(i), thus implementing an effective SA in a dis-\ntributed detection environment.\n3.1.2. SCUA formulation for χ2\nTo design a SA that bypasses the χ2 detector, the attack\nvector ak must be crafted to ensure that the test statistic\nzk does not exceed α. This can be achieved by controlling\nthe total residual energy introduced by ak as follows:\nak = Σ\n1\n2 Γ\n\u0012rα\nn, . . . ,\nrα\nn\n\u0013⊤\n−rk\n(10)\nThis distribution allows the attacker to maintain the resid-\nual energy within the threshold α, thereby avoiding detec-\ntion by the χ2 detector.\n3While the NDAE model operates in continuous time, we use\nthe discrete-time index k in our attack formulations to reflect the\ndiscrete nature of digital measurements and control actions in power\nsystems. Here, k represents the sampling instant or time step of the\nmeasurement systems.\n5\n\n\nThe attack vectors in (8), (9), and (10) are designed\nto decieve the ID by ensuring the output remains consis-\ntently at its threshold. In these attacks, we assume that\nID is done prior to the SE process, which means that it is\nused to check the measurements for anomalies before they\nare passed to the joint SE process, as this aligns with the\npaper’s objective of quantifying the effectiveness of the at-\ntacks by analyzing their impact on SE accuracy. However,\nas the common practice would be to employ ID after SE,\nwe also analyze this case, where residuals are computed\nusing the current state estimates: rk = yk −C ˆxk. For\nthis case, we need to account for how the attack vector\npropagates through the state estimates.\nTo avoid solv-\ning the complete NDAE observer or computing LMIs, we\ncan approximate this propagation using a simple Euler\ndiscretization:ˆxk+1 = ˆxk + ∆t(Aˆxk + f(ˆxk, u) + L(yk −\nC ˆxk)). Under attack, y∗\nk = yk + ak, the perturbed state\nestimate can be approximated as:\nˆx∗\nk ≈ˆxk −∆tLak\n(11)\nThis leads to the following residual expression: r∗\nk = yk −\nC ˆx∗\nk = (I + ∆tCL)ak + rk, Defining M = I + ∆tCL,\nthe attack vector can be designed as:\nak = M −1(ζ −rk)\n(12)\nwhere ζ is chosen based on the detector type as in (8),\n(9), or (10). Note that for small sampling times ∆t, ma-\ntrix M approaches identity, making both cases (ID before\nand after SE) nearly equivalent. In either case, these at-\ntack vectors serve as baselines that will be refined in the\nfollowing section to satisfy physical constraints.\nThese strategies imply that once a SCUA is initiated,\nthe detector’s output remains consistently at its thresh-\nold.\nThis highlights the importance of carefully tuning\nthe threshold. If set too high, it may allow SAs to pro-\ngressively diverge the state estimates from actual system\nstates without detection. On the other hand, a threshold\nthat is too low could result in numerous false alarms.\nTo launch these attacks, an adversary must have access\nto the measurements vector, state estimates, and the pa-\nrameters of the intrusion detector. For the Chi-squared\ndetector, this means knowing the threshold, α. For the\nCUSUM detector, the attacker would need to know the\nvalue of τ, b and the CUSUM statistic from the prior step,\nck−1. The latter is particularly challenging, as ck−1 is not\ntypically communicated externally, which provides an in-\nherent security advantage for the CUSUM detector over\nstatic ID methods [39].\nAlthough these assumptions may be idealized, they al-\nlow us to construct worst-case attack scenarios that serve\nas benchmarks for evaluating the robustness of more re-\nalistic and advanced strategies, as discussed in the next\nsection.\nNext, we propose a Stealthy Constraint-Aware Attack\n(SCAA) strategy that addresses the limitations of SCUAs\nby (i) evading detection by intrusion detection systems,\n(ii) ensuring state estimation converges to valid solutions,\nand (iii) maintaining physically plausible state estimates\nthat satisfy the dynamic and algebraic constraints of the\nNDAE model. This approach quantifies the more limited\nattack space in SCAAs compared to SCUAs, which do\nnot consider these constraints. We introduce two meth-\nods for implementing SCAAs: an optimization-based ap-\nproach that treats the problem as a constrained optimiza-\ntion and an algorithmic method leveraging closed-form so-\nlutions from SCUAs.\n3.2. Stealthy Constraint-Aware Attacks (SCAAs)\nIn contrast to SCUAs that bypass detection without\nconsidering model constraints, Stealthy Constraint-Aware\nAttacks (SCAAs) are designed to evade detection while\nadhering to the algebraic and operational constraints of\nNDAE-modeled power systems.\nThese constraints, de-\nnoted as C, include the algebraic power flow (13a)–(13b)\nand power balance equations (13c)–(13d), as well as the\noperational limits on generator outputs (13e)–(13f), bus\nvoltage magnitudes (13g), and transmission line flows\n(13h)–(13i), as follows:\nPGi =\n1\nx′\ndi\nE′\nqivi sin(δi −θi) −xqi −x′\ndi\n2x′\ndixqi v2\ni sin(2(δi −θi)) (13a)\nQGi =\n1\nx′\ndi\nE′\nqivi cos(δi −θi) −x′\ndi + xqi\n2x′\ndixqi v2\ni\n−xqi −x′\ndi\n2x′\ndixqi v2\ni cos(2(δi −θi))\n(13b)\nPGi + PRi −PLi =\nN\nX\nj=1\nvivj(Gij cos θij + Bij sin θij)\n(13c)\nQGi + QRi −QLi =\nN\nX\nj=1\nvivj(Gij cos θij −Bij sin θij),\n(13d)\nP min\nGi\n≤PGi ≤P max\nGi ,\n(13e)\nQmin\nGi ≤QGi ≤Qmax\nGi ,\n(13f)\nV min\ni\n≤Vi ≤V max\ni\n,\n(13g)\nSfi ≤Fmax,\n(13h)\nSti ≤Fmax,\n(13i)\nwhere Sfi and Sti represent the apparent power flows at\nthe from and to ends of a transmission line, respectively,\nand Fmax denotes the line’s maximum rating. These vari-\nables are functions of active and reactive powers, voltage\nmagnitudes at the corresponding buses, and the line ad-\nmittance. For a detailed description of the variables and\ntheir specific formulations, refer to Appendix A.\nSCAAs aim to manipulate PMU measurements to in-\ntroduce disturbances that can impact the state estima-\ntion process, all while ensuring that the attacked state\nestimates comply with both the algebraic and operational\nconstraints in C.\nTo ensure that the SCAA approach computationally\ntractable for larger systems, we start by defining an attack\nzone that captures how perturbations propagate through\n6\n\n\nthe network topology.\nAlgorithm 2 in Appendix B de-\ntermines this zone by analyzing the network’s admittance\nmatrix structure and bus classifications.\nStarting from\nthe targeted measurement buses, the algorithm propagates\nthrough zero-injection buses while adding non-zero injec-\ntion buses to the boundary of the attack zone. This ap-\nproach captures all buses that could be affected by the\nattack while maintaining a tractable problem size. The\nalgorithm also identifies the specific state variables that\nmust be considered within this zone, including both dy-\nnamic states of generators and algebraic states of buses\nthat either lie within or are directly connected to the at-\ntack zone.\nThis targeted approach allows us to enforce\nconstraints only where they are physically relevant, signif-\nicantly reducing computational complexity compared to\nconsidering the entire system.\nTo formally define the SCAA strategy, we formulate the\nfollowing optimization problem:\nmaximize\nak\np\nX\ni=1\n|ak|\n(14a)\nsubject to\nˆx∗\nA(k) = F(ˆxA(k −1), y∗(k)),\n(14b)\n\f\f\f\nX\ngL(ˆx∗\nA(k))\n\f\f\f ≤ζ,\n(14c)\nh(ˆx∗\nA(k)) ≤0,\n(14d)\nD(ˆx∗\nA(k), y∗(k)) ≤γ,\n(14e)\ny∗(k) = y(k) + Γak\n(14f)\nThe objective function (14a) aims to maximize the sum\nof the absolute values of the attack vector components,\nrepresenting the maximum perturbation an attacker can\ninject into the selected measurements to disrupt the SE\nprocess. The stealthiness and physical plausibility of the\nattack are ensured through a series of constraints imposed\non the manipulated measurements and the resulting al-\ntered state estimates.\nConstraint (14b) represents computing the attacked\nstate estimates resulting from perturbed measurements\nwithin the attack zone. This ensures that the optimiza-\ntion considers how the attack will affect the SE outcome.\nConstraints (14c) and (14d) ensure physical plausibility\nby enforcing power system algebraic and operational con-\nstraints on the states in the set S defined by Algorithm 2 in\nAppendix B. Lastly, constraint (14e) ensures that the ID\noutput D remains below the detector’s threshold γ. This\nconstraint can represent either (5) for the CUSUM statis-\ntic, or (6) for the χ2 statistic, depending on the ID method\nin use.\nTo make the proposed SCAA optimization formulation\ncomputationally feasible, we linearize the algebraic con-\nstraints in (14c) using a first-order Taylor expansion to\nenable more tractable optimization. We ensure that the\nlinear approximation remains valid by periodically updat-\ning the linearization points during the attack.\nThe lin-\nearized algebraic constraints are expressed as\ngL(ˆx∗(k)) = g(ˆx0) + ∇g(ˆx0)(ˆx∗(k) −ˆx0).\nFunction F(·) in (14b), which is used to compute the\nattacked state estimates, can be defined in several ways.\nOne option is to assume the attacker has access to a joint\nobserver, allowing them to estimate the attacked states\nby solving a modified state estimation problem similar\nto (3).\nAlternatively, the attacker could update their\nstate estimates dynamically using a pseudo-inverse ap-\nproach, ˆx∗\na(k) = ˆxa(k −1) + C†y∗(k), assuming mini-\nmal changes between time steps.\nThis approach works\nwell when the power system’s state evolves slowly, and the\npseudo-inverse C† exists and is reliable. However, practi-\ncal limitations, such as measurement redundancy or errors\nin system topology, may affect the rank of C, reducing the\neffectiveness of this method.\nWhile the optimization-based approach provides a for-\nmal framework for SCAAs,\nwe propose an alterna-\ntive, computationally efficient method called the Iterative\nConstraint-Aware Attack Algorithm (ICAA). This algo-\nrithm leverages the closed-form solution of SCUAs and it-\neratively scales it down to satisfy both intrusion detection\nand physical constraints of the NDAE system.\n3.3. Iterative Constraint-Aware Attack Algorithm (ICAA)\nThe key idea behind ICAA is to start with the maxi-\nmum possible attack magnitude that satisfies the intrusion\ndetection constraint. If this initial attack vector satisfies\nall system constraints, it is immediately applied. Other-\nwise, the algorithm iteratively reduces the attack magni-\ntude until all constraints are met. This approach offers\nseveral advantages. It is computationally efficient, avoid-\ning complex optimization solvers and making it suitable for\nreal-time applications. The iterative nature ensures both\nintrusion detection and physical constraints are always sat-\nisfied, adapting to the current system state and potentially\nallowing larger attacks when constraints are less bind-\ning. Unlike the optimization approach, ICAA doesn’t re-\nquire constraint linearization, avoiding approximation er-\nrors and enhancing accuracy in highly nonlinear systems.\nThis method balances attack impact with constraint sat-\nisfaction, providing an alternative to optimization-based\ntechniques. The ICAA is presented in Algorithm 1.\nThe algorithm takes as input the current measurements\ny(k), detector parameters, attack selection matrix Γ, con-\nstraint tolerance ζ, scaling factor β, maximum iterations\nNmax, and detector type. It starts by initializing the at-\ntack vector to zero and setting the detection threshold γ\nbased on the detector type. The initial attack vector is\nthen computed using the SCUA formulation for the cho-\nsen detector. The algorithm then enters a loop where it\niteratively checks if the current attack vector satisfies all\nconstraints. The function F(·) in line 4 computes the at-\ntacked state estimates. This can be implemented as a sin-\ngle step of the joint observer (3) or using a pseudo-inverse\napproach.\nIf all constraints are satisfied, the algorithm\nterminates and returns the current attack vector. Other-\nwise, it scales down the attack vector by a factor of (1−β)\n7\n\n\nAlgorithm 1 Iterative Constraint-Aware Attack\nRequire: y(k), ˆx(k), α (for χ2), τ, b (for CUSUM), Γ, ζ,\nβ, Nmax, detector type\nEnsure: ak\n1: Initialize ak = 0, set γ ←α (χ2) or τ (CUSUM)\n2: ak(Γ) ←attack vector from (8) or (10) based on ID\ntype\n3: y∗(k) ←y(k) + ak\n4: ˆx∗(k) ←F(y∗(k), ˆx(k −1))\n5: for i = 1 to Nmax do\n6:\nif | P g(ˆx∗(k))| ≤ζ and h(ˆx∗(k)) ≤0 and\nD(y∗(k), ˆx∗(k)) ≤γ ((5) or (6)) then\n7:\nbreak\n▷All constraints satisfied\n8:\nend if\n9:\nScale ak by (1 −β)\n▷Reduce attack magnitude\n10:\ny∗(k) ←y(k) + ak\n11:\nˆx∗(k) ←F(y∗(k), ˆx(k −1))\n12: end for\n13: if i = Nmax then\n14:\nak ←0\n▷Attack infeasible, revert to no attack\n15: end if\n16: return ak\nand recomputes the attacked measurements and state es-\ntimates. This process continues for a maximum of Nmax\niterations. If no feasible attack is found within these iter-\nations, the algorithm reverts to no attack.\nThe proposed algorithm is highly scalable, irrespective\nof the size and order of the NDAE model. A key advan-\ntage of the approach is that it does not require solving the\nNDAE model at each iteration, which is typically com-\nputationally expensive.\nInstead, it begins with attacks\ndesigned as upper bounds based on the intrusion detec-\ntion (ID) and state estimation (SE) parameters (referred\nto as SCUAs) and iteratively refines them. Since the initial\nSCUA attack vectors are computed in constant time, O(1),\nand the algorithm’s refinement process involves straight-\nforward scaling operations and constraint checks, its over-\nall computational complexity remains O(1) as well. This\nensures the algorithm’s practical for real-time implemen-\ntation even in systems with high-dimensional state spaces\nor complex dynamics.\nRegardless of the SCAA formulation the attacker\nchooses, it requires them to have comprehensive knowledge\nof both the intrusion detection methods (e.g., (8) or (10))\nand the NDAE system.\nSpecifically, the attacker must\npossess detailed information about the NDAE model’s al-\ngebraic and dynamic equations, operational limits, and the\nstructure of the SE process. Refer to Tab. 1 for the specific\nknowledge requirements for the proposed attack strategies.\nWhile these assumptions might be idealistic, they align\nwith the literature on constructing SAs against AC SE,\nand we leverage them not merely to formulate a perfect\nattack, but rather to explore the efficacy of NDAE mod-\nels in offering enhanced protection against tailored SAs.\nFigure 1: Single-line diagram of the IEEE 39 Bus Network.\nTable 1: Knowledge Requirements for SCUAs and SCAAs/ICAAs\nKnowledge Area\nSCUA\nSCAA/ICAA\nID Parameters\nDetection thresholds (α, τ, b) and resid-\nual covariance matrix (Σ)\nSE Parameters\nObserver gain matrix (L) and measure-\nment matrix (C)\nSystem Topology\nNot required\nY-Bus\nmatrix\n(Ybus) and knowl-\nedge of grid topol-\nogy\nOperational\nCon-\nstraints\nNot considered\nPower\nflow\nequa-\ntions\nand\nopera-\ntional limits within\nthe attack zone A\nSpecifically, we compare the impact of SCUAs and SCAAs\non NDAE-specific SE process to assess whether the inher-\nent coupling in these models reduces the attack space and\nincreases resilience—an aspect that has been overlooked in\nstudies using simplified models.\n4. Case Studies\n4.1. Simulation Setup and Parameters\nWe assess the feasibility and impact of the proposed\nSA strategies on the fourth-order NDAE model discussed\nin Section 2.1. We conduct case studies using the IEEE\n39-bus system. System parameters are obtained from the\nMATPOWER toolbox [41]. For the 39-bus system, follow-\ning [42], we install PMUs at buses 2, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 17,\n19, 20, 22, 23, 25, and 29 to ensure complete observability.\nThe attack scenarios are initiated at t = 15 sec, allow-\ning the system to reach steady-state conditions prior to\nthe attack. The simulations are run for a total of 30 sec\nto capture the short-term and long-term impacts of the\nattacks on the power system dynamics, SE process, and\nID performance.\nThe threshold of the χ2 detector is set according to\nα = 2P −1 \u0000 58\n2 , 1 −\n1\n1000\n\u0001\n= 99.175 For a CUSUM detec-\n8\n\n\ntor that uses a combined distance measure zk = r⊤Σ−1r,\nthe threshold is set to τ = 116.28 and the bias it set to\nb = 50.14 to establish the same false alarm rate of the\nχ2 detector.\nFor a CUSUM that uses a vectorized dis-\ntance measure, z = |r|, there are 58 thresholds and 58\nbias parameters, omitted for brevity. The parameters of\nthe ICAA strategy (Algorithm 1) are set to Nmax = 100,\nβ = 0.01, and ζ = 0.22. We discuss how the choice of\nNmax and β affects the attack impact, and how the choice\nof ζ for a system operator affects attack detection through\nconstraint validation.\nRenewables are integrated into the NDAE model by\nmodifying the algebraic power flow equations to account\nfor renewable disturbances. Specifically, the real and reac-\ntive power from renewables (PR and QR) are included as\ncomponents of the algebraic variables, q(t), which repre-\nsent system-wide power flows. The algebraic constraints of\nthe NDAE model are given by: 0 = Aaxa +Fafa(xd, xa)+\nBaq, where q = [P ⊤\nR , Q⊤\nR, P ⊤\nL , Q⊤\nL]⊤, and PR and QR rep-\nresent the power contributions from renewables. To incor-\nporate variability, we model renewable power injections as:\nq(t) = ¯q + ∆q(t), where ¯q represents the nominal steady-\nstate power injection and ∆q(t) captures time-varying dis-\nturbances, including stochastic variations. These distur-\nbances are modeled as Gaussian noise with zero mean and\nvariance proportional to the renewable generation capacity\n[20].\nFig. 1 illustrates the IEEE 39-bus system under study,\nhighlighting the buses targeted in the attack scenarios\n(10 and 11), marked in red.\nThe attack zone, cal-\nculated using Algorithm 2, is determined to be A =\n{5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 31, 32}, as highlighted in the gray box.\nWhile these buses define the primary attack zone for most\nsimulations, alternative sets of target buses may be occa-\nsionally used, and specific changes are noted when appli-\ncable.\n4.2. Impact of SAs on State Estimation Accuracy\nWe compare the impact of the two proposed SA strate-\ngies (SCUAs and SCAAs) on the SE process in Fig. 2. For\nintrusion detection, a CUSUM detector is employed with a\ncombined distance metric for all residuals. The Root Mean\nSquare Error (RMSE) was chosen because of its sensitivity\nto both small and large deviations, making it particularly\nsuitable for capturing the impact of stealthy attacks.\nThe RMSE value under normal operation is 0.3178.\nSCUAs result in a significant increase in this value to\n1.2437.\nThis can also be observed in the deviations in\nboth algebraic and dynamic states. In contrast, SCAAs\ndemonstrate more subtle impacts on state estimates, with\nan RMSE of 0.36286. The frequency, voltage magnitude,\nand rotor angle estimates under SCAAs remain closer to\ntheir true values, with only minor fluctuations.\nThe NDAE model and NDAE-specific SE techniques al-\nlow us to observe how measurement manipulation imme-\ndiately propagates to dynamic generator state estimates.\nThis represents a significant advantage over studies focus-\ning solely on AC SE processes, where only steady-state\nestimates can be monitored.\nThe simultaneous simula-\ntion and estimation of dynamic and algebraic states in\nthe NDAE framework provides attackers with less oppor-\ntunity to manipulate measurements while ensuring that\nresulting state estimates satisfy algebraic constraints and\nevade intrusion detection. This increased difficulty for at-\ntackers likely stems from the interaction terms between\ndynamic and algebraic variables in equations (13a) and\n(13b). These interactions significantly limit the feasible at-\ntack space, as changes in one state variable have cascading\neffects on others that must be accounted for to maintain\nplausibility. This demonstrates how NDAE models inher-\nently provide greater cybersecurity resilience compared to\ndecoupled or simplified power system representations.\nIn Fig. 3, we further illustrate the impact of SCUAs\nand SCAAs on the state estimation process using three\nmetrics:\nthe Mean Absolute Error (MAE) over time\nand the absolute error dynamics for selected states un-\nder both attack strategies.\nThe first subplot highlights\nthat SCAA/ICAA consistently achieves lower MAE val-\nues compared to SCUA, reflecting the reduced impact of\nattacks when algebraic and operational constraints are sat-\nisfied. The second and third subplots display the absolute\nerror dynamics for six representative dynamic states of\ngenerator 1 under SCUA and SCAA/ICAA, respectively.\nThese plots emphasize how constraint-aware attacks limit\nthe attacker’s ability to manipulate the system, as evi-\ndenced by the smaller deviations in state estimates. This\nunderscores the fact that requiring the attacker to satisfy\nthe physical and algebraic constraints of the NDAE model\nsignificantly reduces their room for manipulation, ulti-\nmately enhancing the system’s resilience against stealthy\nattacks.\n4.3. Algebraic Constraint Violations in SCUAs\nFig.\n4 illustrates the number of algebraic constraint\nviolations over time for 50 different SCUA attempts. Con-\nstraint violations are consistently zero before the attack\ninitiation at t = 15 seconds, confirming the validity of the\nNDAE model and SE process under normal conditions.\nUpon attack initiation, there is an immediate spike in\nviolations, this sharp increase demonstrates the SCUA’s\ndisregard for NDAE model constraints. After the initial\nspike, the number of violations generally stabilizes for most\nattack attempts. This plateau suggests that while SCUAs\ncan maintain their intrusion detection evasion, they con-\nsistently violate the underlying physical constraints of the\nNDAE model. These results underscore the importance of\nincorporating NDAE model constraints in attack detection\nschemes.\nWhile SCUAs may evade traditional residual-\nbased detectors, their consistent violation of algebraic con-\nstraints provides an additional layer for identifying mali-\ncious activities in NDAE-modeled power systems.\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n !\"#$%!&'\"$()!*\n*+'\"$(($,-\nFigure 2: Comparison of power system states of generator 2 under\nSCUAs (left column) and SCAAs (right column).

Comparison between SCAA strategies\nThe\nIterative\nConstraint-Aware\nAttack\nAlgorithm\n(ICAA) (defined in Algorithm 1) achieves results com-\nparable to the optimization-based SCAA approach (14),\nand in some cases, it even performs better. The key ad-\nvantage of ICAA lies in its simplicity. Instead of solving\na complex optimization problem, ICAA starts with the\nmaximum possible attack vector and iteratively refines it\nin small steps to find a vector that bypasses detection,\nsatisfies state estimation, and adheres to all physical con-\nstraints of the power system.\nAlgorithm 1 governs this\nprocess, focusing only on states in the attack zone defined\nby Algorithm 2, reducing computational overhead signifi-\ncantly. As shown in Fig. 5, results from 100 different runs\nusing chi-squared for ID (with varying measurement noise\nand initial conditions) indicate that the average MAE is\nalmost identical for both approaches. Given these simi-\nlar outcomes, we opt to use ICAA in the analysis of the\nattacks in the case studies, where SCAA/ICAA is con-\nsistently employed for evaluating attack strategies. This\nchoice highlights the practicality and computational effi-\nciency of ICAA as a robust tool for analyzing stealthy\nattacks on power systems.\n4.5. Computational Efficiency of SCAA-ICAA\nTab. 2 presents the relationship between the reduction\nfactor (β), simulation time, and RMSE for SCAA-ICAA\nattacks over a 30-second period.\nThese results demon-\nstrate the trade-off between attack impact and computa-\ntional efficiency in the ICAA approach.\nA β\nvalue of (0.1) results in faster computation\ntimes (0.9932 seconds) while achieving the highest RMSE\n(0.3571), indicating the most impactful attack vector.

This indicates that a β value of 0.1\nprovides the optimal trade-off between attack impact and\ncomputational efficiency in our NDAE-modeled power sys-\ntem.\nThe lack of significant improvement in attack ef-\nfectiveness when reducing β below 0.1, despite the sub-\nstantial increase in computation time, suggests that more\nfine-grained iterations do not yield more potent attacks in\nthis scenario. This behavior likely stems from the inherent\nconstraints of the NDAE model, which limit the extent to\nwhich an attacker can manipulate state estimates while\nmaintaining plausibility and evading detection.\n4.6. Sensitivity of SCAAs to Algebraic Constraint Toler-\nance\nFig. 6 demonstrates the significant impact that the toler-\nance threshold ζ for algebraic constraints has on the effec-\ntiveness of SCAAs in NDAE power system models. The\nζ parameter represents the maximum allowed deviation\nfrom zero for the sum of algebraic constraints (g(x) = 0)\nin the NDAE model.\nThe results demonstrate a clear trade-off in NDAE-\nbased power system security. Tighter constraints (lower ζ)\nsignificantly limit an attacker’s ability to manipulate state\nestimates without detection, as evidenced by the lower\nRMSE at ζ = 0.22. However, overly strict constraints may\nlead to false alarms due to normal system fluctuations or\nmeasurement noise. Conversely, looser constraints (higher\nζ) reduce false positives but increase vulnerability to so-\nphisticated attacks, as shown by the sharp RMSE increase\nat ζ = 0.6.\nIt’s important to note that in our simulations, which in-\ncorporate loads, renewables, and various noise sources, we\n\n\n\n\n\n !\"#$%&'()\nFigure 7: Comparison of CUSUM and chi-squared detection under\nSCUAs and SCAAs\nobserve an average constraint violation of 0.22 under nor-\nmal conditions. This baseline deviation from zero stems\nfrom inherent system uncertainties and estimation limi-\ntations. Thus, the chosen ζ values are calibrated to ac-\ncount for these practical considerations, ensuring mean-\ningful constraint validation in operational settings.\n4.7. Comparison of CUSUM and Chi-squared Detectors\nFig. 7 compares the RMSE values for state estimates un-\nder SCUA and SCAA-ICAA strategies, considering both\nCUSUM and chi-squared detectors.\nUnder normal con-\nditions with no attack, both detectors show similar low\nRMSE values (approximately 0.3), validating the SE accu-\nracy in the absence of attacks. For SCUAs, the CUSUM\ndetector shows an RMSE increase to about 1.3, indicat-\ning substantial state estimate deviation, while the chi-\nsquared detector’s RMSE rises to approximately 1.56, sug-\ngesting even greater vulnerability to SCUAs. In the case\nof SCAAs, the CUSUM detector shows a moderate RMSE\nincrease to about 0.4, demonstrating the effectiveness of\nconstraint-aware attacks in limiting detectable impacts,\nwhile the chi-squared detector’s RMSE reaches about 1.3,\nindicating higher susceptibility to SCAAs compared to\nCUSUM.\nThese results highlight several key points. The CUSUM\ndetector generally outperforms the chi-squared detector\nin limiting the impact of both SCUA and SCAA strate-\ngies.\nThis suggests that the CUSUM’s ability to track\ncumulative changes over time provides an advantage in\ndetecting subtle, persistent attacks in NDAE systems.\nSCAAs consistently produce lower RMSE values compared\nto SCUAs for both detector types. This demonstrates how\nincorporating NDAE model constraints significantly re-\nstricts the attacker’s ability to manipulate state estimates\nwhile maintaining stealthiness. The chi-squared detector’s\nhigher RMSE values, especially for SCAAs, indicate its\nlimitations in capturing the complex dynamics of NDAE\nsystems. These findings emphasize the need for advanced,\nNDAE-specific detection methods that leverage both dy-\nnamic residual analysis and constraint validation to en-\nhance power system cybersecurity.\n11\n\n\n\n !\"#\"$%\n&\n'(\n()\nFigure 8: Comparison of RMSE Under SCAA for Aggregated vs.\nIndividual CUSUM Detection\n4.8. Aggregated vs. Individual CUSUM Detection\nFig.\n8 presents a comparison of RMSE values for\nstate estimation under SCAAs using aggregated (single\nscalar distance measure) and individual (vectorized dis-\ntance measure) CUSUM detection, across different num-\nbers of compromised measurements (1, 25, and 50). For a\nsingle compromised measurement, both detection methods\nproduce similar RMSE values. However, as the number of\ncompromised measurements increases, notable differences\nemerge.\nWhen using the aggregated CUSUM approach, RMSE\nprogressively rises as more measurements are compro-\nmised, reaching a value of approximately 2 when 50 mea-\nsurements are involved. This suggests that by aggregating\nresiduals, attackers can spread the impact across multi-\nple measurements, keeping the overall detection statistic\nbelow the threshold. In contrast, the individual CUSUM\napproach shows a decrease in RMSE as the number of com-\npromised measurements increases, with RMSE dropping to\naround 0.5 for 50 measurements. This indicates that mon-\nitoring each measurement individually makes it harder for\nattackers to simultaneously meet all individual thresholds.\nThis represents a trade-off in CUSUM detector design for\nNDAE systems. Aggregated approaches, though compu-\ntationally efficient, may be more susceptible to distributed\nattacks. On the other hand, individual monitoring offers\nstronger resistance against large-scale attacks but comes\nwith increased computational demands and a higher like-\nlihood of false alarms.\n4.9. Addressing the Research Questions\nThe case studies and analyses presented in this section\naddress the three research questions posed in the introduc-\ntion.\n• A1. Impact of NDAE models on SA formulation, detec-\ntion, and impact: NDAE models significantly constrain\nthe feasible attack space due to the coupling between\ndynamic and algebraic states.\nSCUAs, while evad-\ning detection, consistently violate algebraic constraints,\nmaking them detectable through constraint validation.\nSCAAs, respecting these constraints, have a more lim-\nited impact on state estimates. This demonstrates how\nNDAE models provide inherent advantages over sim-\nplified representations by enforcing physical consistency\nbetween dynamic and steady-state behaviors.\n• A2.\nEffectiveness of intrusion detectors for NDAE-\nmodeled systems:\nCUSUM detectors outperform chi-\nsquared detectors in mitigating both SCUA and SCAA\nimpacts, likely due to their ability to track cumulative\nchanges in the coupled dynamic-algebraic state space.\nHowever, both detectors show limitations in fully cap-\nturing NDAE dynamics, particularly when attacks tar-\nget multiple measurements simultaneously. This high-\nlights the need for NDAE-specific detection methods\nthat leverage both temporal residual analysis and in-\nstantaneous constraint validation.\n• A3.\nPerformance of NDAE-specific state monitoring\nalgorithms:\nJoint state estimation, coupled with dy-\nnamic intrusion detection, demonstrates improved re-\nsilience against tailored SAs by simultaneously con-\nstraining both dynamic and algebraic state estimates.\nThe effectiveness of these methods is highly sensitive to\nparameter tuning, particularly the algebraic constraint\ntolerance. Tighter constraints significantly limit an at-\ntacker’s ability to manipulate state estimates without\ndetection, but may increase false positives due to nor-\nmal system fluctuations or measurement noise.\n5. Paper Limitations and Future Work\nThis study presents significant advancements in the un-\nderstanding of stealthy attacks on NDAE-modeled power\nsystems, yet it has several limitations that warrant fur-\nther investigation. First, the proposed attack strategies\nare developed under the assumption that attackers pos-\nsess complete knowledge of the system topology, model\nparameters, and intrusion detection mechanisms. While\nsuch assumptions are standard in existing literature and\nallow for a thorough analysis of worst-case scenarios, real-\nworld attackers may operate with partial or incomplete\ninformation. Future research should explore how incom-\nplete knowledge affects the design and efficacy of stealthy\nattacks.\nSecond, the case studies in this paper are limited to the\nIEEE 39-bus system using a fourth-order generator model.\nWhile this benchmark system effectively demonstrates the\nfeasibility and impact of the proposed methods, it repre-\nsents a simplified view of real-world power systems. In fu-\nture work, the proposed methodologies could be extended\n12\n\n\nto larger systems, such as the IEEE 118-bus or 300-bus\nsystems, and incorporate higher-order generator models\nthat capture additional dynamic features, including tur-\nbine and governor dynamics. Additionally, future studies\ncould include advanced renewable energy models to reflect\nthe increasing penetration of variable generation sources\nsuch as wind and solar power.\nDespite these limitations, it is important to note that the\nscalability of the proposed methods has been rigorously\nanalyzed.\nThe Iterative Constraint-Aware Attack Algo-\nrithm (ICAA) is designed to maintain computational ef-\nficiency, with complexity scaling linearly with the size of\nthe attack zone, making it applicable to larger and more\ncomplex power systems. This ensures that the framework\nremains practical for real-world applications, even as the\nsize and complexity of the system grow.\nFinally, this work highlights the resilience benefits pro-\nvided by the coupling of dynamic and algebraic states\nin NDAE models.\nIt also underscores the need for ad-\nvanced detection methods tailored to the unique dynamics\nof NDAE systems. Future research should focus on inte-\ngrating the proposed methods with emerging intrusion de-\ntection technologies, assessing their performance under di-\nverse operational scenarios, and further enhancing the ro-\nbustness of NDAE-based cybersecurity solutions for smart\ngrids.\n6. Conclusions\nThis study presents an analysis of stealthy false data in-\njection attacks on nonlinear differential algebraic equation\n(NDAE) models of power networks. Case studies demon-\nstrate that NDAE models, by capturing the coupling be-\ntween dynamic and algebraic states, inherently provide\ngreater resistance to tailored cyberattacks compared to\nsimplified power system representations.\nThe use of NDAE models and NDAE-specific state\nmonitoring techniques allows for a more holistic view of\nstealthy attack impacts by revealing how measurement\nmanipulations propagate through both algebraic steady-\nstate power flow variables and dynamic generator states.\nThis comprehensive approach offers insights that may be\noverlooked in studies focusing solely on steady-state AC\npower flow or isolated dynamic state estimation processes.\nOur results highlight the importance of incorporating\nNDAE model constraints in attack detection schemes. The\nconsistent violation of algebraic constraints by certain at-\ntack strategies provides an additional layer for identify-\ning malicious activities, even when traditional residual-\nbased detectors fail.\nThe comparison between CUSUM\nand chi-squared detectors underscores the superiority of\ndynamic detection methods in NDAE-modeled systems,\nthough both show limitations in fully capturing the sys-\ntem’s complex dynamics.\nThe proposed attack strategies focus on specific vul-\nnerabilities within particular intrusion detectors, which\nmay reduce their generalizability. However, our goal was\nnot to develop universally applicable strategies but to\ndemonstrate how NDAE models inherently offer stronger\nresilience compared to simplified system representations.\nAdditionally, the assumption of comprehensive system\nknowledge for attackers may not hold in real-world sce-\nnarios. Future work should consider the impact of partial\ninformation on the effectiveness of such attacks.\nWhile\nNDAE models provide enhanced accuracy in capturing\nsystem dynamics, they come with increased computational\ncomplexity. Research into more efficient numerical meth-\nods for real-time NDAE-based security assessment would\nbe an important next step.\nIn conclusion, this work demonstrates the enhanced cy-\nbersecurity resilience offered by NDAE models in power\nsystems.\nIt underscores the importance of using com-\nprehensive system representations in security analysis and\nlays the groundwork for developing more robust, NDAE-\nspecific detection and mitigation strategies for future\nsmart grids.\nReferences\n[1] S.

NDAE Model Full Description\nWe consider the fourth-order model of a synchronous\ngenerator.

The system is characterized by\ndynamic states xd ∈Rnd, including rotor angles δ, an-\ngular velocities ω, transient voltages on the q-axis E′\nqi,\nand transient voltages on the d-axis E′\ndi, where nd is the\noverall number of dynamic states (equals 4ng, where ng is\nthe number of generators in the system). The algebraic\nstates xa ∈Rna comprise generated active and reactive\npowers PG and QG, voltage magnitudes v, and angles θ.\nParameter na defines the number of algebraic states in the\nsystem. Inputs and demands are encapsulated in vectors\nu ∈Rnu, representing mechanical torques and field volt-\nage inputs, and w ∈Rnw, denoting active and reactive\npower demands, with nu and nw defining the number of\ncontrol input and uncertain variables. The NDAE model\nis succinctly represented as:\nGen.

The state-space matrices\nAa ∈Rna×na, Ba ∈Rna×nq, Ad ∈Rnd×nd, Bd ∈Rnd×nu\nare all detailed in [44]. The model can be more concisely\nexpressed in this standard nonlinear DAE form:\nE ˙x = Ax + f(x) + Buu + Bww,\n(A.4)\nwhere the complete state vector x combines both dynamic\nand algebraic states. This form is facilitated by:\nE =\n\u0014I\nO\nO\nO\n\u0015\n, A =\n\u0014Ad\nO\nO\nAa\n\u0015\n, f(x) =\n\u0014fd(x)\nfa(x)\n\u0015\n,\nBu =\n\u0002Bd O\u0003⊤, Bw =\n\u0002O Ba\n\u0003⊤,\nwhere matrix E is singular, thereby encoding the algebraic\nflow constraints.\nAppendix B.

R. Sathia · M. G. Giometto†\nReceived: DD Month YEAR / Accepted: DD Month YEAR\nAbstract\nTheoretical analyses of the hurricane boundary layer have traditionally relied on\nslab models, which provide a limited description of wind proﬁles. Literature on\nheight-resolving methods is typically based on linear analyses, which may fall\nshort of capturing the full sensitivity of the solution to variations in input pa-\nrameters. This work proposes an approximate analytical solution of a nonlinear\nsingle-column model for horizontal winds that uses a constant eddy viscosity and\nis valid outside the eyewall. Building on literature that uses a linearized system\nof equations, we use a series expansion to account for the nonlinearities. We ﬁnd\nthat a ﬁrst-order correction is suﬃcient for most practical cases. This solution\nhelps provide a simpliﬁed understanding of the sensitivity of the radial and tan-\ngential wind proﬁles to input parameters such as the distance from the hurricane\neye and the Coriolis force.\nKeywords Analytical modeling · Nonlinear equations · Series solution · Single\nColumn Model\n1 Introduction\nThe vertical structure of mean wind in hurricane boundary layers (HBLs) is of rele-\nvance for a wide range of engineering applications, including hurricane forecasting,\ndamage modeling, and risk assessment for coastal infrastructure.\nPractical diﬃculties in obtaining wind speed and ﬂux measurements in the\nHBL have traditionally limited the amount of available observational data. Ad-\nvances over the past two decades in observational capabilities (Cione et al., 2020)\nK. R. Sathia\nDepartment of Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, Columbia University, New York,\nNY, USA\nE-mail: krs2199@columbia.edu\n† M. G. Giometto\nDepartment of Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, Columbia University, New York,\nNY, USA\nE-mail: mg3929@columbia.edu\n\n\n2\nK. R. Sathia and M. G. Giometto\nhave provided signiﬁcant insight into HBL processes and informed the develop-\nment of empirical wind proﬁles such as those presented in Vickery et al. (2009),\nwhich have proved useful for operational use. Additionally, recent developments in\nturbulence-resolving HBL simulations (e.g., Bryan et al., 2017a,b; Worsnop et al.,\n2017; Momen et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Ma and Sun, 2021), have opened the\ndoors for a more mechanistic understanding of HBL dynamics.\nSimpliﬁed theoretical analyses are also being explored that build on these ad-\nvancements and enhance our understanding of the wind variation seen in numerical\nand observational studies. Theoretical analyses of the HBL are typically performed\nusing slab models (Kepert, 2010; Smith and Montgomery, 2023) which average out\nor prescribe the vertical dynamical structure. Height-resolving analyses, with a fo-\ncus on the velocity proﬁles, gained traction towards the last quarter of the 20th cen-\ntury (Rosenthal, 1962; Smith, 1968; Eliassen and Lystad, 1977; Meng et al., 1995).\nA summary of these contributions is presented in a recent review by Chang et al.\n(2024).\nAn inﬂuential paper by Kepert (2001) incorporated much of the work in these\nprevious studies and established the system of linear equations used in height-\nresolving models. These equations are the radial and tangential momentum bal-\nance that use the gradient wind balance to model the radial pressure gradient,\nand neglect second and higher order products of velocities. In the limit of large\nradial distance from the storm center, the solution to these equations converges to\nthe classic Ekman layer solution. More recent publications built on this work to\ninclude vertically varying eddy viscosity (Vickery et al., 2009), non-axisymmetric\ngradient wind (Snaiki and Wu, 2017a) and the vertical advection in the eyewall\n(Yang et al., 2021). These works have provided insight into the vertical structure\nof the mean wind in the HBL but are based on a linearized formulation of the\nproblem. While there is some literature that discusses the drawbacks of neglecting\nnonlinearities (Kepert and Wang, 2001; Foster, 2009; Vogl and Smith, 2009), these\nanalyses have relied on a numerical approach to solve the diﬀerential equations.\nThere remains a need for an analytical formula for the variation of mean speed\nthat is backed by nonlinear theory, matches realistic hurricane wind proﬁles, and is\nsuﬃciently simple for use in engineering practice. Such a solution would also help\nelucidate dependencies between ﬂow features and make these easier to interpret\nconceptually.\nThis work proposes an analytical solution of the nonlinear HBL equations valid\noutside the eyewall, using a single column model with constant eddy-viscosity.\nBuilding on Kepert (2001), which analyses the linearised version of the same model,\nwe use a series expansion to account for the nonlinearities. We ﬁrst discuss the\ngoverning equations, boundary conditions and the physical validity of the solutions\nto these equations in Sect. 2 and 3. This is followed by the description of the series\nsolution, of the nonlinear eﬀects and a comparison against the numerical solution\nin Sect. 4. The analytical solution allows for a simple analysis of sensitivity to the\nvarious parameters. This is explored in Sect. 5. A simpler alternative solution for\nthe velocity magnitude is proposed in Sect. 6, which is informed by the analysis\nin Sect. 4 and 5. Conclusions are drawn in Sect. 7.\n\n\nAnalytical solution for the HBL velocity proﬁles\n3\n2 Governing Equations and Non-Dimensionalization\nThe governing equations for the mean velocity proﬁles in the stationary and ax-\nisymmetric HBL far from the eyewall are\nd\ndz\n\u0012\nK dur\ndz\n\u0013\n=\n\u0012V 2\ng\nR + fVg\n\u0013\n−u2\nθ\nR −u2\nr\nR −fuθ ,\n(1)\nd\ndz\n\u0012\nK duθ\ndz\n\u0013\n= uruθ\nR\n+ fur −nur Vg\nR ,\n(2)\nwhere ur is the radial velocity, uθ is the tangential velocity, Vg is the gradient\nwind speed, f is the Coriolis frequency, R is the radial distance from the axis of\nrotation, n is the non-dimensional radial derivative of gradient wind and K is the\nsum of the molecular and turbulent viscosities, which we treat in this analysis to\nbe constant. A detailed derivation is provided in Appendix 9.1. We have used the\nmodelling choices ∂ur/∂r = −ur/R and ∂uθ/∂r = −nVg/R which restrict the\nequations to the region outside the eyewall.\nWe start by considering a constant gradient wind Vg = G. A linearly varying\ngradient wind is considered in Appendix 9.3. For a constant gradient wind, (1)\nand (2) is solved with the boundary conditions\nur(0) = ur(∞) = uθ(0) = 0 ,\nuθ(∞) = G .\n(3)\nConsider the coordinate transformation ˆu = ur and ˆv = uθ−G. Next, introduce\nnon-dimensional height ξ = z/H and non-dimensional velocity variables u = ˆu/G\nand v = ˆv/G. A depth scale similar to the Ekman layer depth H =\np\n2K/I can\nbe constructed to normalize z, where,\nI =\ns\u0012\nf + 2G\nR\n\u0013 \u0012\nf + (1 −n)G\nR\n\u0013\n(4)\nis the inertial stability, as deﬁned in Kepert (2001). Substituting the transforma-\ntions into (1) and (2), one obtains\nd2u\ndξ2 = H2G\nKR\n\u0014\n−\n\u0012 1\nRo + 2\n\u0013\nv −(u2 + v2)\n\u0015\n,\n(5)\nd2v\ndξ2 = H2G\nKR\n\u0014\u0012 1\nRo + (1 −n)\n\u0013\nu + uv\n\u0015\n,\n(6)\nwhere Ro = G/(fR) is a Rossby number based on the gradient wind speed G\nand the radial distance R at which the velocity proﬁles are to be determined.\nSubstituting for H, the equations become\nd2u\ndξ2 = −˜αv −˜γ(u2 + v2) ,\n(7)\nd2v\ndξ2 = ˜βu + ˜γuv ,\n(8)\n\n\n4\nK.

These values correspond to\nRo ∈[1, 200]. The only other parameter in the non-dimensional equations is n.\nFrom Table 2 of Mallen et al. (2005), n ∈[0.04,0.67].\nConsider three cases of n, as tabulated in Table 1. Equations (7) and (8) with\nboundary conditions (10) are solved over a ﬁnite but suﬃciently large domain\nnumerically for cases 1 and 3 and are shown in Fig. 2.\nWe expect velocity proﬁles to resemble those of the classical Ekman layer\nsolution. u should feature a jet with negative peak velocity near the surface and\ndecay further aloft; 1 + v should be positive and be characterized by an elevated\nmaximum and asymptote to a value of 1 aloft to match the gradient wind.\nWe see that the expected behaviour is followed in Case 1 but not Case 3. For\nCase 3, 1 + v does not tend to 1 aloft. The stable numerical solution for 1 + v\nappears like a mirror image about 0 of what we would have expected based on the\nEkman layer solution.\nWe ﬁnd that there is a switch in the stable numerical solution from a form\nsimilar to Case 1 (Fig. 1,a) where v has a positive slope near the ground, to that\nseen in Case 3 (Fig. 1,b) where v has a negative slope near the ground. Through\nsome trial and error, we ﬁnd that this switch occurs at n ≈0.5, with a mild\nsensitivity to Ro.

The eﬀect on the proﬁles\nupon changing Ro is minimal (not shown).\nTo analyse possible solutions to (7) and (8) aloft, we set d2u/dξ2 = d2v/dξ2 =\n0 (the eﬀects of curvature in the velocity proﬁles should only be present close to\nthe ground). We get two algebraic equations\nu2 + v2 +\n\u0012\n2 + 1\nRo\n\u0013\nv = 0 ,\nuv + u\n\u0012\n(1 −n) + 1\nRo\n\u0013\n= 0 .\n(11)\nThere are four solutions to this system of algebraic equations, which are\nu = 0, v = 0 ,\nu = 0, v = −\n\u0012\n2 + 1\nRo\n\u0013\n,\nu = ±\ns\u0012\n(1 −n) + 1\nRo\n\u0013\n(1 + n), v = −\n\u0012\n(1 −n) + 1\nRo\n\u0013\n.\n(12)\nIn Fig. 1(b), we see that the u →0 and (1 + v) →−(1 + 1/Ro). This is consistent\nwith a possible solution in (12), and therefore appears to be a mathematically\nvalid tendency. But this is clearly not physical, since the velocity should approach\nthat of the gradient wind aloft.\nOne simple reason for this switch could be the increasing dominance of the\nnonlinear terms as n becomes larger. This is seen clearly from (5) and (6). For\neven a moderately large Ro (say, Ro > 10), the eﬀect of 1/Ro can be neglected.\nFocusing on n, we see that as n becomes larger, the coeﬃcient attached to u in\n(6) is much smaller than that attached to uv, and hence the nonlinear behaviour\ndominates the linear.\nDetails of the numerical solver are given in Appendix 9.2 and a qualitative\nmechanism for this ﬂip is described. Additionally, in Appendix 9.2, we plot velocity\nproﬁles with a vertically varying eddy viscosity (Fig. 10,a). Even with the variable\neddy viscosity, the switch of solution behaviour is seen. However, the n at which\n\n\n6\nK. R. Sathia and M. G. Giometto\nthis switch occurs appears to be pushed to a higher value (n ≈0.67 for the chosen\neddy viscosity proﬁle).\nMeng et al. (1995), Kepert (2001) and other subsequent work (Snaiki and Wu,\n2017b; Fang et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2021) consider a slip condition instead at the\nbottom boundary. The switch in solution behaviour for large n is observed with\nthis boundary condition as well. For example, using C = 0.002 and K = 50 m2s−1\nas in Kepert (2001), the switch is observed at n ≈0.69 (Fig. 10,b). Raising C to\na larger value, such as 0.02, causes the switch to occur at a lower n ≈0.55.\nThe observed behaviour limits the physical validity of the governing equations\nand suggests that care must be taken when using large values of n to ensure that\nthe solution to the equations retains physical tendencies.\n4 Approximate analytical solution\nAcknowledging the above limitations of the governing equations, we constrain the\nstudy in this section to n ∈[0, 0.45]. Increases in the parameters Ro and n make the\nsolution increasingly dependent on the nonlinear terms. In all the cases considered,\nthe coeﬃcient attached to the nonlinear terms are of the same order of magnitude\nas those of the linear terms, and therefore nonlinear terms cannot be neglected.\nWe follow Lyapunov’s artiﬁcial small parameter method (Nayfeh, 2008). At-\ntaching an artiﬁcial small parameter δ to the nonlinear terms, the equations are\nd2u\ndξ2 = −˜αv −δ˜γ(u2 + v2) ,\n(13)\nd2v\ndξ2 = ˜βu + δ˜γuv .\n(14)\nConsider a series expansion of the form\nu(ξ) = u0(ξ) + δu1(ξ) + δ2u2(ξ) + · · · ,\n(15)\nv(ξ) = v0(ξ) + δv1(ξ) + δ2v2(ξ) + · · · .\n(16)\nSubstituting the series and collecting orders of δ, we obtain the following systems\nof equations at the ﬁrst few orders. The leading order equations read\n∂2u0\n∂ξ2 = −˜αv0 ,\n(17)\n∂2v0\n∂ξ2 = ˜βu0 ,\n(18)\nwith boundary conditions u0(0) = u0(∞) = v0(∞) = 0, v0(0) = −1. Similarly, the\nﬁrst order correction reads\n∂2u1\n∂ξ2 = −˜αv1 −˜γ(u2\n0 + v2\n0) ,\n(19)\n∂2v1\n∂ξ2 = ˜βu1 + ˜γ(u0v0) ,\n(20)\n\n\nAnalytical solution for the HBL velocity proﬁles\n7\nwith boundary conditions u1(0) = u1(∞) = v1(0) = v1(∞) = 0. The second order\ncorrection is\n∂2u2\n∂ξ2 = −˜αv2 −˜γ(2u0u1 + 2v0v1) ,\n(21)\n∂2v2\n∂ξ2 = ˜βu2 + ˜γ(u0v1 + u1v0) ,\n(22)\nwith the same boundary conditions as for the ﬁrst order problem.\nNote that we have used the no-slip boundary condition instead of a slip con-\ndition. This choice is made to come up with a suﬃciently simple form of the\nsolution including nonlinear eﬀects that can represent the various trends seen in\nmore complicated analyses. Future versions of this analysis that include a varying\neddy viscosity or a higher ﬁdelity boundary condition would likely match realistic\nvelocity proﬁles even more closely.\nThe solution to the equations at the leading order is simply that of the Ekman\nlayer, namely\nu0 = −˜α\n2 e−ξ sin(ξ) ,\n(23)\nv0 = −e−ξ cos(ξ) .\n(24)\nTo obtain the ﬁrst-order correction, substitute for u0 and v0 from Eqns. (23) and\n(24) into (20) and (19), and then substitute u1 from (20) in (19). The resulting\nequation can be solved by considering an ansatz which is a linear combination of\nterms in the following product of sets\nn\n1, e−ξ, e−2ξo\n× {1, cos(ξ), sin(ξ), cos(2ξ), sin(2ξ)} .\n(25)\nSubstituting the ansatz, comparing terms and solving for the coeﬃcients, we obtain\nu1(ξ) = ˜γ\n10\n\u0012 ˜α2\n4 + 1\n\u0013\ne−ξ cos(ξ) + ˜γ\n30e−ξ sin(ξ)\n−˜γ\n10\n\u0012 ˜α2\n4 + 1\n\u0013\ne−2ξ + ˜γ\n30\n\u0012\n−3\n8 ˜α2 + 2\n\u0013\ne−2ξ sin(2ξ) ,\n(26)\nv1(ξ) =\n˜γ\n15˜αe−ξ cos(ξ) −˜γ\n5˜α\n\u0012 ˜α2\n4 + 1\n\u0013\ne−ξ sin(ξ)\n−˜γ\n10˜α\n\u0012 ˜α2\n4 + 1\n\u0013\ne−2ξ +\n˜γ\n30˜α\n\u00123˜α2\n4\n+ 1\n\u0013\ne−2ξ cos(2ξ) .\n(27)\nThe solutions beyond the ﬁrst order become increasingly unwieldy and diﬃcult\nto interpret conceptually. Further, as elaborated below, the ﬁrst-order solution\nalready represents a noticeable enhancement in accuracy compared to the lin-\near leading-order solution, and is also suﬃciently close to the numerical solution.\nThis work will therefore focus primarily on the ﬁrst-order solution. Appendix 9.4\npresents the second order correction for the interested reader.\nNoting that the gradient wind vector is seldom constant with height in the\nHBL, Appendix 9.3 generalizes the above solution to linearly decreasing gradient\nwinds.\n\n\n8\nK. R. Sathia and M. G. Giometto\n4.1 Comparison with numerical solution\nLeading and ﬁrst order solutions are contrasted against the numerical solution\nin Fig. 2 for cases 1 and 2 of Table 1. Case 1 has a small n = 0.3 that falls\nwell within the solution’s region of validity. Based on the ﬁgure, it is apparent\nthat a ﬁrst-order correction is suﬃcient to closely match the numerical solution.\nThe corrections modulate the inﬂow, yielding slightly more diﬀused inﬂow and\ntangential velocity proﬁles. Case 2 is characterized by a relatively larger n = 0.45,\nwhich is close to the bordering n ≈0.5 beyond which the switch in stable solution\nwas observed (§ 3). The solution features a slower convergence rate, requiring\na larger number of terms to obtain an adequate approximation. However, these\nhigher order solutions are required only when n becomes quite close to (say, within\n0.05 of) the critical value, and a ﬁrst order solution remains suﬃcient for smaller\nn. For n ⪆0.5, the analytical solution diverges.\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nCase 1\nNumerical\nOrder 1\nOrder 0\n(a)\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nCase 2\nNumerical\nOrder 1\nOrder 0\n(b)\nFig. 2: Analytical and numerical solution for cases 1 and 2 of Table 1.\nThe correction term v1 is negative near the ground (upto ξ ≈3) and u1 has\nan S-like shape where it is positive at the ground and negative above. Both the u1\nand v1 terms thus have a tendency to reduce the magnitudes of the peak radial\nand tangential velocities respectively.\nThe role of the corrections in moderating the gradient of the velocity near\nthe ground is also interesting. The derivative of v1 is negative upto ξ ≈1, and\nthus decreases the slope of tangential velocity at the ground. As n increases, the\nstrength of this reduction in the slope of v0 by v1 also increases. This may be\nconnected to the switch in solution behaviour, and is elaborated in Appendix 9.2.\nOverall, the proposed corrections oﬀer improvements to the linear (leading-order)\nsolution and additional insight into the nonlinear eﬀects.\n5 Sensitivity Analysis\nTo characterize the role of the input parameters, we analyse here the sensitivity\nof the normalized solutions to their variations. A discussion on sensitivities is also\npresented for the solutions in the more intuitive dimensional form.\n\n\nAnalytical solution for the HBL velocity proﬁles\n9\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nRo = 1\nRo = 10\nRo = 100\n(a)\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nn = 0\nn = 0.15\nn = 0.3\nn = 0.45\n(b)\nFig. 3: Sensitivity of the ﬁrst order accurate solutions in normalized form to Ro\nand n.\nG\n40 m s-1\nn\n0.25\nK\n50 m2s-1\nR\n50 km\nf\n5 × 10−5 s-1\nGz\n0 s-1\nTable 2: Dimensional values of parameters used to plot Figures 4 to 6.\nFigure 3(a) shows the sensitivity to Ro for n = 0.3. For a given latitude, a small\nRo means either that G is small or that R is large. Thus, small Ro is not a very\ninteresting case. When Ro becomes large, we expect the eﬀect of the latitude to be\nnegligibly small. Wind proﬁles should get closer to each other as Ro increases. This\nis reﬂected in Fig. 3(a), with the curve for Ro = 10 appearing almost superimposed\non the curve for Ro = 100. Figure 3(b) plots the sensitivity to n for Ro = 100. As\nn increases, so does the strength of the inﬂow. The sensitivity to n for 1 + v is,\nhowever, far less pronounced than for u.\nSensitivities of the solutions in dimensional form are discussed next. Solutions\nare dimensionalized based on parameter values listed in Table 2, with the exception\nof the parameter that is being varied.\nFigure 4(a) shows the sensitivity to G.\nAs is expected, G has a strong impact on the shape and magnitude of the velocity\ncomponents. As G increases, the uθ proﬁles feature a strengthened jet with a more\npronounced nose moving closer to the surface. A similar behavior characterizes the\nur proﬁle. The sensitivity to variations in n is shown in Fig. 4(b). As was seen\nin the non-dimensional analysis in Fig.3(b), despite its importance in determining\nthe convergence of the analytical solution, this parameter only modulates the ur\nproﬁle with a modest impact on uθ. The sensitivity to K is shown in Fig. 5(a). As\nK increases, there is increased mixing, causing the jet to become wider. With larger\nK, the peak of this more diﬀuse jet also tends to become higher. The role of K here\nis similar to that in the Ekman layer. The eﬀect of increasing R (Fig. 5,b) is quite\nsimilar to that of increasing K. As R increases, the jet becomes less pronounced\nand thicker, and its elevation above the surface level increases. This is consistent\nwith the intuition that as we move farther away from the eye of the hurricane, the\neﬀect of the centrifugal force term in the gradient wind forcing becomes smaller,\n\n\n10\nK.

For example, we examine the peak magnitude and height of the inﬂow and\nuse the leading order solution for the radial velocity for simplicity. Diﬀerentiating\n23 and setting to zero, one obtains ξpeak\nur\n= π/4, corresponding to\nzpeak\nur\n= 1.11\nr\nKR\nG\n\u0012\u0012 1\nRo + 2\n\u0013 \u0012 1\nRo + (1 −n)\n\u0013\u0013−0.25\n≈0.93\ns\nKR\nG√1 −n .\n(28)\nwhere in the last step we have use 1/Ro ≈0. From this formula we see that, to\nthe leading order, R and K have the same eﬀect on the height of the inﬂow peak.\nThis was also observed in the two parts of Fig. 5. From the formula, as G and n\n\n\nAnalytical solution for the HBL velocity proﬁles\n11\nincrease, the height of the peak decreases, which is also seen in Fig. 4.

Figure 6(a) shows the sensitivity to f. Coriolis frequency\nhas a small impact for this radius, since the centrifugal term dominates the Coriolis\nterm. The impact of f is slightly more visible for a larger radius of, say R = 200 km\n(not shown). But for cases of interest, i.e., for small R and large G, the eﬀect due\nto f is negligible.\nThe sensitivity to variations in Gz is shown in Fig. 6(b). As apparent, this\nparameter mainly aﬀects the slope of uθ away from the surface, with minimal\nimpact on the ur proﬁles.\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\nf = 2.5\n10-5 s-1\nf = 5\n10-5 s-1\nf = 7.5\n10-5 s-1\nf = 10\n10-5 s-1\n(a)\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\nGz = -0.001 s-1\nGz = -0.002 s-1\nGz = -0.003 s-1\nGz = -0.004 s-1\n(b)\nFig. 6: Sensitivity to f and Gz.\nAlthough (30) was derived using the linear solution (23), we can extend this to\nthe nonlinear solution using the fact the solution is insensitive to Ro (see Fig. 3,a).\nNeglecting 1/Ro, the solution to (7) and (8) is only a function of ξ and n. For a\nﬁxed n, the non-dimensional peak is a constant value. In a dimensional setting,\nthis thus means that even the nonlinear solution features\nzpeak\nur\n, zpeak\nuθ\n∝\nr\nKR\nG f(n) .\n(30)\nIf we vary only G (or, alternatively, K or R) holding the other constants ﬁxed,\nthen height of the peak velocity values for the leading and ﬁrst order analytical\nand numerical solutions are simply multiples of each other. We demonstrate this\nin Fig. 7, where normalized variations of peak heights for a range of parameter\nsweeps are shown. Normalized peak heights are deﬁned as\nζui\nG = zpeak\nui\n(G, q0) −zpeak\nui\n(G0, q0)\nzpeak\nui\n(G0, q0)\n,\n(31)\n\n\n12\nK. R. Sathia and M. G. Giometto\nwhere ui denotes either ur or uθ, and q0 refers to the other dimensional parameters\nthat we hold ﬁxed. We see that the six curves overlap for variations in G, R and\nK. The overlap is weaker for larger G and R, due to the small eﬀect from Ro.\nThe above reasoning does not however hold for n, and this is conﬁrmed by\nFig.7(b) where no collapse is observed. We also note that the numerical solution\nshows a faster growth of peak height with n than the linear solution. The ﬁrst order\nanalytical solution is an improvement to the linear solution but fails to match the\nnumerical solution as n increases. The ﬁgure also shows that, for the numerical and\nﬁrst order solutions, the rate of growth of the peak height is higher for tangential\nvelocity than radial velocity. This is not captured by the linear solution, for which\nthe dashed curve overlaps the solid one.\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\nG (ms-1)\n-0.35\n-0.3\n-0.25\n-0.2\n-0.15\n-0.1\n-0.05\n0\n(a)\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nn\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n(b)\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nK (m2s-1)\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\nNumerical u\nOrder 1 u\nOrder 0 u\nNumerical ur\nOrder 1 ur\nOrder 0 ur\n(c)\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nR (km)\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n(d)\nFig. 7: Normalized variations of peak heights for the tangential and radial veloc-\nities against variations of selected dimensional parameters.\n6 Velocity Magnitude\nFigure 8(a) plots the numerical solution for the velocity magnitude\np\nu2 + (1 + v)2,\nfor a range of representative Ro and n values.

The curves from left to right are cases 1 to 4 of Table 3 respectively.\nIf one is interested only in the magnitude of velocity, then this ﬁnding presents\nan alternative strategy to obtain the velocity proﬁle for larger n. We had noted\nin Sect. 4 that for small n, the analytical solution with ﬁrst order correction is\nindistinguishable from the numerical solution. We can therefore consider the case\nwhen Ro →∞and n = 0 for the ﬁrst order analytical solution. In this limit,\nthe coeﬃcients are constant numerical values. Substituting 1/Ro = n = 0 in (23),\n(24), (26) and (27), we obtain\nu0 + u1 = −1.37e−ξ sin(ξ) + 0.42e−ξ cos(ξ)\n−0.42e−2ξ −0.05e−2ξ sin(2ξ) ,\n(32)\n1 + v0 + v1 = 1 −0.97e−ξ cos(ξ) −0.30e−ξ sin(ξ)\n−0.15e−2ξ + 0.12e−2ξ cos(2ξ) .\n(33)\nSince the coeﬃcients are just numerical values (and not functions of Ro or n),\nan even simpler strategy could be to perform a curve ﬁt. A simple ﬁt C(ξ) of the\nvelocity magnitude yields\nC(ξ) = 1 −0.88e−ξ cos(ξ) −0.28e−ξ sin(ξ)\n−0.13e−2ξ cos(2ξ) + 0.31e−2ξ sin(2ξ) .\n(34)\nFigure 8(a) also includes\np\n(u0 + u1) + (1 + v0 + v1)2 from (32) and (33), and the\ncurve ﬁt C(ξ) in (34).

This solution can also be tested for robustness in a dimensional setting.\nWe consider four curves, with various values of the dimensional parameters listed\nin Table 3.

The curve\nﬁt shows a slight deviation for larger n (see rightmost curve), but the analytical\nsolution superposes the numerical solution almost exactly. This proves further that\nthe simpler strategies derived in this section are robust alternatives to the series\nexpansion from Sect.4, when considering the velocity magnitude.\nUsing this new analytical solution, we can now obtain the depth and peak\nvalue of the velocity magnitude by diﬀerentiating\np\n(u0 + u1) + (1 + v0 + v1)2 and\nsetting to 0.\nξpeak = 2.56 =⇒zpeak = 3.62\nr\nKR\nG\n\u0012\u0012 1\nRo + 2\n\u0013 \u0012 1\nRo + (1 −n)\n\u0013\u0013−0.25\n.\n(36)\nFor large Rossby number, this simpliﬁes further to\nzpeak = 3.04\ns\nKR\nG√1 −n .\n(37)\nThe dependence of the height of the peak from 37 is also seen in Figs. 4 and 5. As\nK and R increase, the height of the peak tangential velocity increases. Whereas as\nG increases, the height of the peak decreases slightly. The sensitivity of the depth\nappears to be greater for K and R because they have a much broader range of\nphysical values than does G. The coeﬃcient 3.04 is larger than the coeﬃcient 0.93\nobtained earlier, indicating that the peak inﬂow occurs at a lower height than that\nof the velocity magnitude. This is consistent with the solution to the Ekman layer.\nSubstituting 37 in 35 gives us a maximum dimensional velocity magnitude of\n1.0528G. Notice that this value depends only on the gradient wind magnitude.\nThus, while the height at which the peak occurs is dependent on the viscosity,\nradius etc., the percentage supergradient predicted by this analysis, i.e. 5.28%, is\na constant. The existing literature largely focuses on the radius of maximum wind\n(RMW) within the eyewall, where much higher supergradient values are reported\n(e.g., Kepert and Wang, 2001). We emphasize that our analysis is constrained to\nthe region outside the eyewall. Despite this diﬀerent focus, the value we obtain,\n5.28%, still falls within the range of supergradient values reported in some of these\nstudies (e.g., Yang et al., 2021).\n\n\nAnalytical solution for the HBL velocity proﬁles\n15\n7 Summary and Conclusions\nThis work has presented approximate solutions to the nonlinear equations de-\nscribing the vertical structure of the horizontal velocity proﬁles in the HBL under\nconstant and linearly varying gradient wind. The formulation is based on a series-\nexpansion approach and it has been shown that including a ﬁrst-order correction\nto the linear leading order solution increases the accuracy of the model while re-\ntaining a relatively simple form. The solution has been compared against a linear\ncounterpart and a corresponding “exact” numerical solution across a range of re-\nalistic values of the input parameters in both normalized and dimensional form.\nVelocities were scaled with gradient wind speed G and vertical coordinate z was\nscaled with\np\n2K/I, following Kepert (2001). We found that\np\n2K/I remains a\nrobust choice of scaling for z even when accounting for the nonlinear terms in the\ngoverning equations, further corroborating ﬁndings from the numerical study of\nFoster (2009).\nIt was shown that nonlinear terms cause a switch in the stable solution from a\nphysical one, where uθ →G aloft, to a nonphysical one where uθ →−G (1 + 1/Ro).\nThus, care must be taken when prescribing n, so that the solution to the equa-\ntions retains physical tendencies. This also prompts a closer look at the modeling\nassumption ∂v/∂r ≈−nVg/R. A better approximation to this radial derivative\nas a function of z (for example, ∂v/∂r ≈−nv/R) instead of a constant or linear\nfunction throughout the height of the boundary layer could yield an approximation\nthat is closer to reality.\nFrom a wind proﬁles perspective, the non-dimensional ﬁrst order solution ex-\nhibits a reduced peak velocity magnitude and more elevated jets when compared\nto its leading-order counterpart. In normalized form, the parameter Ro was found\nto have a negligible impact on the velocity proﬁles. In dimensional form, the so-\nlution was found, as expected, to be sensitive to variations in G, R and K and\ninsensitive to variations in f. These were used to show that both the height of in-\nﬂow and tangential velocity peak in both the linear and nonlinear solutions follow\na\np\nKR/G dependence. The parameter n, along with its role in controlling the\nconvergence of the analytical solution, was found to primarily control the inﬂow\nproﬁle. It however does not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the tangential velocity and\nvelocity magnitude. Building on this lack of sensitivity to variations in Ro and\nn, a simple alternative expression was proposed to describe the velocity magni-\ntude proﬁle. This simpliﬁed expression provides insight into the dependence of the\njet height and magnitude on the various parameters and shows that the peak jet\nmagnitude is 5.28% supergradient.\nIn summary, the proposed series solution provides a nuanced yet still conceptu-\nally simple description of velocity proﬁles in the HBL and associated sensitivites,\naccounting for the impact of non-linear terms. Although valid only away from\nthe eyewall and under the assumption of constant eddy viscosity, this formulation\nserves as a foundation for developing operational models that capture the correct\nsensitivities of the hurricane boundary layer proﬁle.\n\n\n16\nK.

But close to the surface\n(and suﬃciently far from the eyewall) it is also known that the velocity proﬁles\nfollow the log-law (Powell et al., 2003; Smith and Montgomery, 2014). Future ver-\nsions of this procedure that account for variable-eddy viscosity could simply adjust\nthe eddy viscosity so that the velocity follows the log-law near the wall.

Dot-dashed lines are u and solid lines are 1 + v.\nTo solve the system of ordinary diﬀerential equations numerically, we use a\nﬁnite diﬀerence based solver. A pseudo-time term is added and time marching is\nperformed with a 3rd order Runge-Kutta method. We use a domain size from ξ = 0\nto ξ = 10 and 200 grid points to discretize the domain.

The WENO based derivatives are capable of capturing sharp gradients\nand oﬀers greater numerical stability compared to simpler ﬁnite diﬀerences based\n\n\nAnalytical solution for the HBL velocity proﬁles\n21\nderivatives. This is especially useful here since there is a signiﬁcant deviation of\nthe steady state solution for large n from the initial condition, which caused a di-\nvergence of the solution when the simpler ﬁnite diﬀerences based derivatives were\nused.\nFigure 9 shows snapshots at every 2750 steps of pseudo-time of the solution\nof case 3 of Table 1. We notice that, ﬁrst, the nonlinearities tend to make the\ngradient of the tangential velocity near the bottom boundary less steep. Once the\ncurve becomes approximately perpendicular to the boundary (Fig. 9,c), there is a\nsharp switch of the tangential velocity curve to the other stable solution (cf. (11)).\nThis behaviour where the nonlinearities tend to make the gradient of the tangential\nvelocity near the ground smaller is also seen in cases without a switch of solution\n(Fig. 2). This also suggests that the critical value of n could be that for which the\nslope of the tangential velocity solution is exactly zero at the ground.\nThe n for which the switch in solution is seen can be postponed if the velocity\ngradient near the ground is forced to be larger. This could be due, for example, to\na variable eddy viscosity or a slip boundary condition. Consider the eddy viscosity\nproﬁle\nK(z) = 0.4z\n\u0010\n1 −z\nL\n\u00114\n.\n(71)\nFigure 10(a) shows the numerical solution to (1) and (2) with n = 0.6 and using\nK(ξ) from (71) (with L = 3000 m) instead of a constant value. The values of the\nother constants are those speciﬁed in Table 2. We see that even for n = 0.6, the\nproﬁles continue to be physical. If we push to a larger value of n, the switch in\nsolution is seen again, through a similar mechanism as in Fig. 9. By trial and error,\nthe transitional value of n ≈0.67.

Giometto\n9.3 Appendix 3: Extension to linearly varying gradient wind\nConsider a linearly varying gradient wind\nVg = G + z Gz\n(72)\nwhere Gz < 0.

The leading order reads\n∂2u0\n∂ξ2 = −˜αv0 + (˜αf\nGz)ξ ,\n(79)\n∂2v0\n∂ξ2 = ˜βu0 ,\n(80)\nwith boundary conditions u0(0) = u′\n0(∞) = 0, v0(0) = −1, v′\n0(∞) = f\nGz. The ﬁrst\norder correction is\n∂2u1\n∂ξ2 = −˜αv1 −˜γ(u2\n0 + v2\n0 −f\nGz\n2ξ2) ,\n(81)\n∂2v1\n∂ξ2 = ˜βu1 + ˜γ(u0v0 −f\nGznξu0) ,\n(82)\n\n\nAnalytical solution for the HBL velocity proﬁles\n23\nwith boundary conditions u1(0) = u′\n1(∞) = v1(0) = v′\n1(∞) = 0. The second order\ncorrection reads\n∂2u2\n∂ξ2 = −˜αv2 −˜γ(2u0u1 + 2v0v1) ,\n(83)\n∂2v2\n∂ξ2 = ˜βu2 + ˜γ(u0v1 + u1v0 −f\nGznξu1) ,\n(84)\nwith the same boundary conditions as for the ﬁrst order problem.\nThese equations contain additional non-homogeneous terms which are products\nof polynomial terms {ξ, ξ2, ...} and the terms {exp(−ξ) cos(ξ), exp(−ξ) sin(ξ), ...}.\nThis calls for a larger set of basis functions in our ansatz, namely\nn\n1, ξ, ξ2o\n×\nn\n1, e−ξ, e−2ξo\n× {1, cos(ξ), sin(ξ), cos(2ξ), sin(2ξ)} .\n(85)\nSubstituting the ansatz and solving for the coeﬃcients readily results in the fol-\nlowing leading-order solution\nu0 = −˜α\n2 e−ξ sin(ξ) ,\n(86)\nv0 = −e−ξ cos(ξ) + f\nGzξ ,\n(87)\nand ﬁrst-order correction\nu1(ξ) = ˜γ\n10\n\u0012 ˜α2\n4 + 1\n\u0013\ne−ξ cos(ξ) + ˜γ\n30e−ξ sin(ξ)\n−˜γ\n10\n\u0012 ˜α2\n4 + 1\n\u0013\ne−2ξ + ˜γ\n30\n\u0012\n−3\n8 ˜α2 + 2\n\u0013\ne−2ξ sin(2ξ) +\nf\nGz˜γ ˜α2\n8\n(1 −n) ξe−ξ sin(ξ) ,\n(88)\nv1(ξ) =\n˜γ\n15˜αe−ξ cos(ξ) −˜γ\n5˜α\n\u0012 ˜α2\n4 + 1\n\u0013\ne−ξ sin(ξ)\n−˜γ\n10˜α\n\u0012 ˜α2\n4 + 1\n\u0013\ne−2ξ +\n˜γ\n30˜α\n\u00123˜α2\n4\n+ 1\n\u0013\ne−2ξ cos(2ξ) .\n(89)\nHigher order solutions can similarly be obtained. We observe that there is no term\ninvolving f\nGz in v1. Even the term involving f\nGz in u1 is quite small compared to\nthe other terms and almost no diﬀerence is seen in a plot where the term is ignored\n(not shown). Hence one can suﬃciently incorporate the eﬀect of f\nGz with just the\nterm f\nGzξ in v0 and safely ignore its presence in the corrections.\nDue to limited observational data, there are very few numerical values reported\nin the literature for Gz. Here, we choose a representative value to be that used in\nBryan et al. (2017b), i.e., a decrease of the gradient wind speed of 40 m s-1 over\n18 km. Assuming this Gz is for R = 50 km and K = 50 m2 s-1 gives H = 250 m.\nHence f\nGz = 250/18000 = 0.014.\nFigure 11 shows the comparison between the numerical and analytical solutions\nfor Cases 2 and 4 in Table 2, and with f\nGz = 0.014.

Prior works on\nBayesian Pseudo-Coresets (BPC) attempt to reduce the computational load for\ncomputing weight posterior distribution by a small number of pseudo-coresets\nbut suffer from memory inefficiency during BPC training and sub-optimal results.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose Variational Bayesian Pseudo-Coreset\n(VBPC), a novel approach that utilizes variational inference to efficiently approx-\nimate the posterior distribution, reducing memory usage and computational costs\nwhile improving performance across benchmark datasets.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nWhile deep learning has shown remarkable performance across various fields, its success requires\nlarge amounts of data storage and extensive training. However, handling such large datasets can\nimpose a significant computational burden, especially when training new models or updating ex-\nisting ones with new data. In settings like continual learning, where the model must be trained\ncontinuously on new data, this challenge becomes more pronounced due to the risk of catastrophic\nforgetting. To mitigate this, a small subset of representative data, called a coreset, is needed to pre-\nserve knowledge from previously learned data. Instead of creating a small dataset as a subset of the\nentire data to represent it, the approach of treating the small dataset itself as learnable parameters\nand training it to mimic the entire dataset is known as dataset distillation or pseudo-coreset (Nguyen\net al., 2020; 2021; Zhou et al., 2022; Loo et al., 2023).\nOn the other hand, Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) have gained attention in fields like health-\ncare (Abdullah et al., 2022; Lopez et al., 2023) and climate analysis (Vandal et al., 2018) because\nthey provide a posterior distribution over the weights of a deep neural network, enabling the mea-\nsurement of predictive uncertainty and allowing for a probabilistic interpretation of parameters (Pa-\npamarkou et al., 2024). While this method is promising for enabling various types of statistical\nanalysis, BNNs face significant challenges when applied to real-world scenarios that involve large-\nscale datasets. The high-dimensional parameter space and structure of BNNs often lead to posterior\nlandscapes with multiple modes, which complicates efficient and straightforward computation of\npredictive uncertainty. To overcome this, BNNs typically rely on indirect methods such as Stochas-\ntic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC; Welling & Teh, 2011; Chen et al., 2014; Ma\net al., 2015) or variational inference (VI; Blei et al., 2017; Fiedler & Lucia, 2023; Harrison et al.,\n2024b) instead of directly calculating the posterior distribution in closed form. However, these\napproaches still depend on gradient-based updates of model weights for large-scale datasets. In par-\nticular, SGMCMC-based methods face the challenge of increased computational load, as the amount\nof training grows linearly with the number of weight samples needed.\nTo overcome these issues, prior works on Bayesian Pseudo-Coreset (BPC; Manousakas et al., 2020;\nKim et al., 2022; 2023; Tiwary et al., 2024) aim to learn a small synthetic dataset that helps effi-\nciently compute the posterior distribution of BNNs’ weights. These studies train the pseudo-coreset\nby minimizing the divergence between the posterior obtained using the full dataset and the posterior\nobtained using the pseudo-coreset. However, these studies face three major problems: 1) require\n1\narXiv:2502.21143v1  [cs.LG]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nexpert trajectories for training, 2) use stop-gradient during training, and 3) still rely on SGMCMC\nsampling for weight space posterior computation. First, expert trajectories refer to the trajectories of\nmodel weights trained using the full dataset. In previous studies, these trajectories are saved for every\nepoch with multiple different seeds, and they are used to approximate and match the posterior dis-\ntribution. This creates the problem of needing to store the model weights for the number of epochs\nmultiplied by the number of seeds in order to train the pseudo-coreset. Secondly, when training\nBPC, the posterior distribution is computed using the BPC for loss computation via gradient-based\nmethods. As the updates progress, the computational graph required to update the pseudo-coreset\nbased on the loss becomes significantly larger, resulting in increased memory demands. To address\nthis memory issue, prior works have used the stop-gradient method to reduce memory consumption.\nHowever, this approach leads to sub-optimal results because it prevents accurate updates. Finally,\neven after training the pseudo-coreset, the weight posterior distribution remains multi-modal, mean-\ning that while the training cost is reduced, sequential training through SGMCMC sampling is still\nrequired for each sample. Additionally, after obtaining the samples, forward computation is needed\nfor each sample to calculate the predictive distribution during Bayesian inference.\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel BPC approach called Variational Bayesian Pseudo-\nCoreset (VBPC). In learning VBPC, unlike previous works, we employ VI, specifically last-layer\nVI (Fiedler & Lucia, 2023; Harrison et al., 2024b), to approximate the posterior distribution. During\nthe VBPC training and inference process, we demonstrate that this variational formulation allows\nus to obtain the closed-form posterior distribution of the last layer weights, which frees our method\nfrom relying on stop-gradient. This resolves the issue of suboptimal performance seen in previous\napproaches. And, we propose a memory-efficient method to approximate the predictive distribution\nwith only a single forward pass instead of multiple forwards, making the approach computationally\nand memory-efficient. Furthermore, we empirically show that VBPC achieves better performance\ncompared to other baselines on various benchmark datasets.\n2\nPRELIMINARIES\n2.1\nBAYESIAN NEURAL NETWORKS AND BAYESIAN MODEL AVERAGING\nIn Bayesian Neural Network frameworks (Papamarkou et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024), the main\nobjective is to compute the predictive distribution for a given input x, while accounting for model\nuncertainty (i.e., epistemic uncertainty), as shown below:\np(y|x, D) =\nZ\np(y|x, θ)p(θ|D)dθ,\n(1)\nwhere D represents the observed data, and θ denotes the model parameters. This process is known\nas Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). To perform BMA, we need to compute the posterior distri-\nbution p(θ|D) and evaluate the integral. However, due to the complexity of the model and the high-\ndimensional parameter space, directly computing a closed-form solution for p(θ|D) is impractical.\nTherefore, in practice, we typically rely on posterior sampling methods such as SGMCMC (Welling\n& Teh, 2011; Chen et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2015) or VI (Blei et al., 2017; Fiedler & Lucia, 2023) to\napproximate the posterior distribution.\n2.2\nBAYESIAN PSEUDO-CORESET\nAs mentioned in Section 1, the large size of the training dataset makes it computationally intensive\nto perform SGMCMC or VI for approximating the posterior distribution of BNNs. To address\nthese challenges and efficiently compute the posterior distribution in terms of both computation and\nmemory, previous works (Kim et al., 2022; 2023; Tiwary et al., 2024) introduced BPC within the\nSGMCMC framework. Specifically, BPC S is optimized using the following objective:\nS∗= arg min\nS\nD(p(θ|D), p(θ|S)),\n(2)\nwhere D can be various divergences between the two distributions (Kim et al., 2022). The optimiza-\ntion poses a challenge, as the posteriors p(θ|D) and p(θ|S) are intractable for most of the cases.\nPrevious works (Kim et al., 2022; 2023; Tiwary et al., 2024) attempt to approximate them using\nweight checkpoints obtained from training trajectories based on the dataset D (i.e., expert trajecto-\nries) which requires expensive computation and memory cost.\n2\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n2.3\nNATURAL GRADIENT VARIATIONAL INFERENCE WITH EXPONENTIAL FAMILIES\nAlthough several methods exist for approximating the posterior p(θ|D), in this paper, we focus on\nVI (Bishop, 2006; Blundell et al., 2015; Blei et al., 2017). In VI, we approximate the target posterior\nwith a variational distribution that is easier to handle and optimize the parameters of the variational\ndistribution to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the approximate and target\nposterior distributions. Among the many possible choices for variational distributions, we focus on\nthe exponential family. We assume that both the prior pλ0(θ) and the variational distribution qλ(θ)\nbelong to the same class of exponential family distributions:\nqλ(θ) ∝exp(⟨ψ(θ), λ⟩−A(λ)),\npλ0(θ) ∝exp(⟨ψ(θ), λ0⟩−A(λ0)),\n(3)\nwhere ψ(·) represents the sufficient statistics, A(·) is the log partition function, and λ and λ0 are\nthe natural parameters for qλ and pλ0, respectively. We further assume that the exponential family\nis minimal, meaning that there is no non-zero vector x such that ⟨x, ψ(θ)⟩evaluates to a constant.\nUnder this setting, we can optimize the variational parameter λ by minimizing the following loss:\nLD(λ) := Eqλ[−log p(D|θ)] + βDKL[qλ(θ)∥pλ0(θ)],\n(4)\nwhere β > 0 is a temperature controlling the strength of the KL regularization (Blundell et al.,\n2015; Wenzel et al., 2020).\nWhen β\n= 1, minimizing Eq. 4 is equivalent to minimizing\nDKL[qλ(θ)∥p(θ|D)]. Optimizing equation 4 with natural gradient descent (Amari, 1998) has been\nshown to be effective, especially for large-scale deep neural networks (Khan et al., 2018; Osawa\net al., 2019; Shen et al., 2024). The optimal solution of Eq. 4 must satisfy the following equation,\nλ∗= λ0 + β−1∇µEqλ∗[log p(D|θ)],\n(5)\nwhere µ = Eqλ[ψ(θ)] = ∇λA(λ) is the mean parameter corresponding to the natural parameter λ.\nExcept for some cases, Eq. 5 does not admit a closed-form expression for λ∗. Therefore, one must\nrely on iterative algorithms to obtain it. This approach, which solves the variational inference using\niterative natural gradient descent steps, covers a broad spectrum of machine learning algorithms and\nis commonly referred to as the Bayesian Learning Rule (BLR) (Khan & Rue, 2023).\n3\nVARIATIONAL BAYESIAN PSEUDOCORESET\nIn this section, we propose a novel method called Variational Bayesian Pseudo-Coreset (VBPC)\nwhich effectively learns S and thereby well approximates the variational posterior distribution with\nfull dataset distribution. Several recent studies (Fiedler & Lucia, 2023; Harrison et al., 2024b) have\nshown that using only a last layer for variational inference is simple and computationally cheap,\nyet it performs comparably to more complex methods. Motivated by these findings, we seek to\nlearn a pseudo-coreset S that effectively approximates the last layer variational posterior for the\nclassification task, all while ensuring computational and memory efficiency.\n3.1\nPROBLEM SETUP\nConsider a supervised learning problem with a dataset D = (xi, yi)n\ni=1. While our discussion\ncan be easily extended to more general problems, in this paper, we focus on k-way classification\ntasks, where yi ∈{0, 1}k is a one-hot vector representing a category. Given D and a model fθ\nparameterized by θ, we aim to learn a synthetic dataset (pseudocoreset) S := (ˆxi, ˆyi)ˆn\ni=1 solving\nEq. 2 under a constraint ˆn ≪n. We approximate the pseudocoreset posterior p(θ|S) by solving the\nfollowing variational inference problem,\nLS(λ) := ℓS(λ) + βSDKL[qλ(θ)∥pλ0(θ)],\nλ∗\nS = arg min\nλ\nLS(λ),\n(6)\nwhere ℓS(λ) := −Eqλ[Pˆn\ni=1 log pS(yi|xi, θ)] is the expected sum of negative log-likelihoods over\nS given a choice of likelihood pS(y|x, θ). Throughout the paper, we call Eq. 6 as coreset VI prob-\nlem. Ideally, we would like to match the optimal solution of the coreset VI problem to the optimal\nvariational distribution computed with the original dataset D,\nLD(λ) := ℓD(λ) + βDDKL[qλ(θ)∥pλ0(θ)],\nλ∗\nD = arg min\nλ\nLD(λ),\n(7)\nwhere ℓD(λ) := −Eqλ [Pn\ni=1 log pD(yi|xi, θ)] for a likelihood pD(y|x, θ). We call Eq. 7 as dataset\nVI problem. After obtaining λ∗\nS and λ∗\nD, to learn S, we can minimize D(qλ∗\nS, qλ∗\nD) for some pre-\ndefined divergence D.\n3\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n3.2\nBILEVEL OPTIMIZATION\nIt is often challenging to first compute the approximate solutions of Eqs. 6 and 7 and then backprop-\nagate through the divergence D(qλ∗\nS, qλ∗\nD). Instead, considering the optimization nature of the VI,\nwe cast the problem of coreset learning as a bilevel optimization as follows:\nS∗= arg min\nS\nLD(λ∗\nS) where λ∗\nS = arg min\nλ\nLS(λ).\n(8)\nNote that similar approaches have also been considered in the dataset distillation literature (Loo\net al., 2023). Under the bilevel optimization formulation, learning S requires the derivative\n∇SLD(λ∗\nS) = (∇Sµ∗\nS)∇µLD(λ∗\nS),\n(9)\nwhere µ∗\nS = ∇λA(λ∗\nS) is the mean parameter corresponding to λ∗\nS. To obtain ∇Sµ∗\nS, we may apply\nthe implicit function theorem (Bengio, 2000; Krantz & Parks, 2002) to Eq. 5. Specifically, if we let:\nF(S, µ) := λ −λ0 + β−1\nS ∇µℓS(λ)\n(10)\nWith F(S, µ∗\nS) = 0, applying the implicit function theorem,\n∇SF(S, µ∗\nS) + (∇Sµ∗\nS)∇µF(S, µ∗\nS) = 0 ⇒∇Sµ∗\nS = −∇SF(S, µ∗\nS)∇µF(S, µ∗\nS)−1,\n∇Sµ∗\nS = −β−1\nS (∇S∇µℓS(λ∗\nS))\n\u0000∇µλ∗\nS + β−1\nS ∇2\nµℓS(λ∗\nS)\n\u0001−1 .\n(11)\nPlugging this back into the above equation, we get the expression for the gradient\n∇SLD(λ∗\nS) = −β−1\nS (∇S∇µℓS(λ∗\nS))\n\u0000∇µλ∗\nS + β−1\nS ∇2\nµℓS(λ∗\nS)\n\u0001−1 ∇µLD(λ∗\nS).\n(12)\nUnfortunately, the term involving the inverse is usually intractable, so one needs an approximation\n(e.g., Lorraine et al. (2020)). In the next section, we describe a case where the derivatives can be\ncomputed in closed form, and develop Bayesian pseudo-coreset algorithm based on it.\n3.3\nLAST LAYER VARIATIONAL BAYESIAN PSEUDOCORESET\nRecently, there has been growing interest in subspace Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), where only\na subset of the network’s parameters are treated as random, while the remaining parameters are kept\ndeterministic (Sharm et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2024). An extreme form of a subspace BNN would\nbe the last layer randomization, where a neural network fθ(x) ∈Rk is decomposed as a feature\nextractor ϕ(x) ∈Rh followed by a linear layer W ∈Rh×k. Denoting the jth column of W as wj\nand the jth output from fθ(x) as [fθ(x)]j, we have [fθ(x)]j = ϕ(x)⊤wj for j ∈[k]. Adapting the\nlast layer randomization scheme, we treat only the parameter W of the linear layer as random while\nkeeping the feature extractor ϕ(x) deterministic. From below, we describe our model more in detail.\nVariational distributions.\nWe assume the Gaussian priors and variational posteriors for W,\npλ0(W) =\nK\nY\nj=1\nN(wj|0, ρ−1Ih),\nqλ(W) =\nk\nY\nj=1\nN(wj|mj, Vj),\n(13)\nwith the natural parameters and the corresponding mean parameters are given as,\nλ0 = concat(\n\u0002\n0 −(ρ−1/2)Ih\n\u0003k\nj=1),\nµ0 = concat(\n\u0002\n0, ρ−1Ih\n\u0003k\nj=1),\nλ = concat((λj)k\nj=1),\nµ = concat((µj)k\nj=1),\n(14)\nwhere λj =\n\u0002\nV −1\nj\nmj −(1/2)Vj\n\u0003\n, and µj =\n\u0002\nmj, Vj + mjm⊤\nj\n\u0003\n. Here, we denote Id as the d × d\nidentity matrix and ρ is a pre-defined precision hyperparameter of the prior. Note that the block-wise\napproximation qλ(W) reduces the space complexity of the variance parameter V := (Vj)k\nj=1 from\nO(k2h2) to O(kh2) while keeping flexibility compare to mean field approximation.\n4\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nLikelihoods.\nFor a classification problem, it is common to use a softmax categorical likelihood,\nand we follow that convention for the dataset VI problem with pD. However, for the coreset VI\nproblem, the softmax categorical likelihoods would not allow a closed-form solution, which would\nnecessitate approximations involving iterative computations to solve the bilevel optimization Eq. 8.\nThis would, for instance, require storing the unrolled computation graph (Vicol et al., 2021) of the\niterative updates and performing backpropagation through it, leading to significant computational\nand memory overhead (Werbos, 1990). As a detour, we use the Gaussian likelihood for the pS, as\nit allows us to obtain a closed-form solution. While using Gaussian likelihoods may seem coun-\nterintuitive for a classification problem, it is widely used in the literature on infinitely-wide neural\nnetworks (Lee et al., 2017; 2019; 2022), and one can also interpret it as solving the classifica-\ntion problem as a regression, using one-hot labels as the target vector. More specifically, we set\npS(y|x, θ) = N(y|W ⊤ϕ(x), γ−1Ik) where γ−1 is the precision hyperparameter for the likelihood.\nWith our choices for pD and pS we can expand the bilevel optimization problem as follows.\nλ∗\nS = arg min\nλ\n−Eqλ\n\" ˆn\nX\ni=1\nlog N(ˆyi|W ⊤ϕ(ˆxi), γ−1Ik)\n#\n+ βSDKL[qλ∥pλ0],\n(15)\nS∗= arg min\nS\nEqλ∗\nS\n\n−\nn\nX\ni=1\nk\nX\nj=1\nyi,j log\nexp(ϕ(xi)⊤wj)\nPk\nl=1 exp(ϕ(x)⊤wl)\n\n+ βDDKL[qλ∗\nS∥pλ0].\n(16)\n3.4\nSOLVING CORESET VI PROBLEM\nBased on our choices described in the previous section, we show how we can obtain closed-form\nexpressions for the coreset VI problem. The likelihood term for the coreset VI problem is\nEqλ\n\"\n−\nˆn\nX\ni=1\nlog N(ˆyi|W ⊤ϕ(ˆxi), γ−1Ik)\n#\nc= γ\n2\nˆn\nX\ni=1\nk\nX\nj=1\nEqλ\nh\u0000ˆyi,j −ϕ(ˆxi)⊤wj\n\u00012i\n,\n(17)\nwhere ˆyi,j indicates jth element of ˆyi for all i ∈[ˆn] and\nc= denotes equality up to a constant. Then\nwe can further elaborate Eq. 17 as follows:\nγ\n2\nˆn\nX\ni=1\nk\nX\nj=1\nEqλ\nh\u0000ˆyi,j −ϕ(ˆxi)⊤wj\n\u00012i c= γ\n2\nk\nX\nj=1\n\u0010\n−2ˆy⊤\n:,jΦµ(1)\nj\n+ Tr\n\u0010\nΦ⊤Φµ(2)\nj\n\u0011\u0011\n,\n(18)\nwhere ˆy:,j := [ˆy1,j, . . . , ˆyˆn,j]⊤, Φ := [ϕ(ˆx1), . . . , ϕ(ˆxˆn)]⊤, µ(1)\nj\n= mj, and µ(2)\nj\n= Vj +mjm⊤\nj for\nall j ∈[k]. Then by Eq. 18, the gradient of the likelihood with respect to µj can be computed as:\n∇µ(1)\nj ℓS(λ) = −γΦ⊤ˆy:,j,\n∇µ(2)\nj ℓS(λ) = γ\n2 Φ⊤Φ,\n(19)\nThen from Eq. 5, we obtain the closed-form solution for the coreset VI problem as follows:\nλ∗\nS,j =\n\u0014 γ\nβS\nΦ⊤ˆy:.j −ρ\n2Ih −\nγ\n2βS\nΦ⊤Φ\n\u0015\n,\n∀j ∈[k],\n(20)\nwith Woodbury formula (Woodbury, 1950) which leads to\nm∗\nj = Φ⊤\n\u0012ρβS\nγ Iˆn + ΦΦ⊤\n\u0013−1\nˆy:,j,\nV ∗\nj = 1\nρIh −\nγ\nρ2βS\nΦ⊤\n\u0012\nIˆn +\nγ\nρβS\nΦΦ⊤\n\u0013−1\nΦ.\n(21)\nFor all j ∈[k], the values V ∗\nj are identical, meaning the full covariance calculation, though O(kh2),\nonly requires computing and storing the variance once, O(h2). We will refer to this shared variance\nas V ∗. See Appendix A.1 and Appendix A.2 for detailed derivations in this section.\nBilevel optimization as an influence maximization.\nBefore proceeding to the dataset VI prob-\nlem, let us describe how the last-layer variational model simplifies the coreset gradient Eq. 12. From\nEq. 19, we have ∇2\nµℓS(λ∗\nS) = 0, leading to ∇2\nµLS(λ∗\nS) = ∇µλ∗\nS. Using this, we can show that\n∇SLD(λ∗\nS) = ∇S\n\u0010\n−∇µLS(λ∗\nS)⊤\u0000∇2\nµLS(λ∗\nS)\n\u0001−1 ∇µLD(λ∗\nS)\n\u0011\n.\n(22)\nHere, −∇µLS(λ∗\nS)⊤\u0000∇2\nµLS(λ∗\nS)\n\u0001−1 ∇µLD(λ∗\nS) is the variant (in a sense that it is defined w.r.t.\nthe gradient of the variational objective by the mean parameters) of the influence function (Koh &\nLiang, 2017), measuring the influence of the coreset S on the dataset VI loss computed with D.\n5\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n3.5\nCOMPUTATION FOR DATASET VI PROBLEM\nNow with these coreset VI problem solutions, we have to find the optimal S∗by solving Eq. 16.\nHowever, unlike the coreset VI problem, since we use a categorical likelihood with a softmax output,\na closed-form solution cannot be obtained from Eq. 16. Thus we have to use iterative updates,\nsuch as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), for the outer optimization problem. Then because\nϕ(x)⊤wj ∼N(ϕ(x)⊤m∗\nj, ϕ(x)⊤V ∗ϕ(x)) for all j ∈[k], the dataset VI problem changed into\nLD(λ∗\nS) = −\nn\nX\ni=1\nk\nX\nj=1\nyi,jEz∼N( ¯\nm∗(xi),¯Σ∗(xi))\n\"\nlog\nexp zj\nPk\ni=1 exp zi\n#\n+ βDDKL\n\u0002\nqλ∗\nS||pλ0\n\u0003\n,\n(23)\nwhere z = [z1, . . . , zk], ¯m∗(x) = [ ¯m∗\n1(x), . . . , ¯m∗\nk(x)], ¯Σ∗(x) = diag([Σ∗\n1(x), . . . , Σ∗\nk(x)]) and\n( ¯m∗\ni (x), Σ∗\ni (x)) = (ϕ(x)⊤m∗\ni , ϕ(x)⊤V ∗ϕ(x)) for all j ∈[k] and x. For a simpler notation, we will\ndenote ( ¯m∗\ni (x), ¯Σ∗\ni (x)) as ( ¯m∗\ni , ¯Σ∗\ni ). Then we have to approximate Ez∼N( ¯\nm∗,¯Σ∗)\nh\nlog\nexp zj\nPk\ni=1 exp zi\ni\nto compute the loss LD(λ∗\nS) analytically. To compute approximate expectation for the likelihood,\nwe first change the form as follows:\nEz\n\"\nlog\nexp(zj)\nPk\ni=1 exp zi\n#\n=\nZ\nlog\n\n2 −K +\nX\ni̸=j\n1\nσ(zj −zi)\n\n\n−1\nN(z| ¯m∗, ¯Σ∗)dz,\n(24)\nwhere σ(·) is the sigmoid function. Then we utilize mean-field approximation (Lu et al., 2020) to\nthe zis to approximately compute the Eq. 24:\nEz∼N( ¯\nm∗,¯Σ∗)\n\"\nlog\nexp (zj)\nPt\ni=1 exp(zi)\n#\n≈\n\u0014\nlog softmax\n\u0012\n¯m∗\n√\n1 + αΣ∗\n\u0013\u0015\nj\n,\n(25)\nwhere α =\nπ\n8 and Σ∗= ϕ(x)⊤V ∗ϕ(x). Refer to Appendix A.3 for the complete derivation of\nEq. 23, Eq. 24, and Eq. 25. By Eq. 25, our outer optimization loss has changed form as follows:\nLD(λ∗\nS) = −\nn\nX\ni=1\nk\nX\nj=1\nyi,j log softmax\n\" \n¯m∗(xi)\np\n1 + αΣ∗(xi)\n!#\nj\n+ βDDKL[qλ∗\nS||pλ0].\n(26)\nHere, since n is large, we need to employ the SGD method to optimize S. Thus, using the training\nbatch B ⊂{(x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn)}, we compute approximate loss ˜LD for the batch and update S\nusing stochastic loss as follows:\n˜LD(λ∗\nS) = −n\n|B|\nX\ni∈B\nk\nX\nj=1\nyi,j log softmax\n\" \n¯m∗(xi)\np\n1 + αΣ∗(xi)\n!#\nj\n+ βDDKL[qλ∗\nS||pλ0].\n(27)\n3.6\nTRAINING AND INFERENCE\nMemory Efficient Loss computing\nIf we naïvely compute the gradient of S by directly eval-\nuating Eq. 27, calculating Σ∗and DKL[qλ∗\nS||pλ0] will require computations involving V ∗, which\ndemands h2 memory. However, the quadratic memory requirements with respect to the feature di-\nmension pose a challenge when training S for large-scale models. To address this issue, we propose\na memory-efficient approach for computing loss during training in this paragraph. We will address\nthe efficient computation of Σ∗in the below paragraph Variational Inference and Memory Effi-\ncient Bayesian Model Averaging. Here, we will focus on efficiently computing the KL divergence.\nSince both qλ∗\nS and pλ0 are Gaussian distributions, the KL divergence can be expressed as follows:\nDKL[qλ∗\nS||pλ0]\nc= 1\n2\n\u0002\n−k log | det(V ∗)| + kρ Tr(V ∗) + ρ∥m∗∥2\u0003\n.\n(28)\nThus we have to efficiently compute det V ∗and Tr(V ∗).\nFor the det V ∗, we use Weinstein-\nAronszajn identity (Pozrikidis, 2014) which results as follows:\ndet V ∗=\n1\nρh det(Iˆn +\nγ\nρβS ΦΦ⊤).\n(29)\n6\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nAnd for the Tr(V ∗), we can easily change the form with a property of matrix trace computation:\nTr(V ∗) = βS\nγ\n \nγh\nρβS\n−\n\u0012 γ\nρβS\n\u00132\nTr\n \u0012\nIˆn +\nγ\nρβS\nΦΦ⊤\n\u0013−1\nΦΦ⊤\n!!\n.\n(30)\nBy these formula, we can calculate the KL divergence without directly computing V ∗, reducing the\nmemory from O(h2) to O(ˆn2). Refer to Appendix A.4 for the derivation of Eq. 28 and Eq. 29.\nModel Pool\nIf we train S based on only one ϕ, it may overfit to that single ϕ, resulting in an\ninability to properly generate the variational posterior for other ϕ’s. This overfitting issue is common\nnot only in Bayesian pseudo-coresets but also in the field of dataset distillation (Zhou et al., 2022).\nWhile several prior studies (Wang et al., 2018; 2022) tackle this overfitting problem, we address it\nby employing a model pool during training, following the approach of Zhou et al. (2022); Loo et al.\n(2023). This model pool method involves generating P different θi’s through random initialization\nduring the training of S and storing them in a set M = {θi}P\ni=1. At each step, one θ is sampled\nfrom M, and ϕ is constructed using this θ. Then, S is trained for one step using SGD with this\nϕ. Afterward, θ is updated by training it for one step using S and the Gaussian likelihood, and\nthe original θ in M is replaced with this updated version. Once each θi has been trained for a\npre-defined number of T steps, it is replaced with a new θ generated through random initialization.\nThrough this process, S is trained with a new ϕ at every step, allowing it to generalize better across\ndifferent ϕ’s and become more robust to various initialization. See Algorithm 1 for a summary of\nthe whole VBPC training procedure.\nVariational Inference and Memory Efficient Bayesian Model Averaging\nAfter training S, we\nuse it for variational inference. During variational inference, to improve the quality of the model’s\nfeature map ϕ, we first train the randomly initialized θ using data sampled from S for a small\nnumber of steps T ′ with a Gaussian likelihood. Then, using the trained feature map ϕ, we compute\nthe variational posterior by finding the optimal mean m∗\nj and variance V ∗for each θL\nj as determined\nin the inner optimization. However, the variance V ∗we computed corresponds to a full covariance\nmatrix, leading to a memory cost of h2. To address this, rather than calculating V ∗explicitly, we\nneed a memory-efficient approach for conducting BMA on test points. This can be done easily by :\nΣ∗= βS\nγ\n \nγ\nρβS\nΦteΦ⊤\nte −\n\u0012 γ\nρβS\n\u00132\nΦteΦ⊤\n\u0012\nIˆn +\nγ\nρβS\nΦΦ⊤\n\u0013−1\nΦΦ⊤\nte\n!\n,\n(31)\nwhere Φte ∈Rnte×h denotes the feature matrix of nte number of test points. Then by storing Φ ∈\nRˆn×h and (Iˆn +\nγ\nρβS ΦΦ⊤)−1 ∈Rˆn×ˆn instead of V ∗, we can reduce the memory requirements\nto ˆnh + ˆn2, which is much smaller than h2. Refer to Algorithm 2 for an overview of variational\ninference and BMA. This procedure does not require multiple forwards for BMA.\n4\nRELATED WORKS\nBayesian Pseudo-Coreset\nAs discussed in Section 1 and Section 2, the large scale of modern\nreal-world datasets leads to significant computational costs when performing SGMCMC or varia-\ntional inference to approximate posterior distributions. To address this issue, previous works, such\nas Bayesian Coreset (BC; Campbell & Broderick, 2018; 2019; Campbell & Beronov, 2019), have\nproposed selecting a small subset from the full training dataset so that the posterior distribution built\nfrom this subset closely approximates the posterior from the full dataset. However, Manousakas\net al. (2020) highlighted that simply selecting a subset of the training data is insufficient to accu-\nrately approximate high-dimensional posterior distributions, and introduced BPC for simple logistic\nregression tasks. Later, Kim et al. (2022) extended BPC to BNNs, using reverse KL divergence,\nforward KL divergence, and Wasserstein distance as measures for D in Eq. 2 to assess the difference\nbetween the full posterior and the BPC posterior. Subsequent works have used contrastive diver-\ngence (Tiwary et al., 2024) or calculated divergence in function space (Kim et al., 2023). However,\nas discussed in Section 1, computational and memory overhead remains an issue when training BPC\nand during inference using BMA.

We compare VBPC with four BPC\nalgorithms that use SGMCMC to perform Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) with posterior sam-\nples: BPC-rKL (Kim et al., 2022), BPC-fKL (Kim et al., 2022), FBPC (Kim et al., 2023), and\nBPC-CD (Tiwary et al., 2024). BPC-rKL and BPC-fKL employ reverse KL divergence and forward\nKL divergence, respectively, for the divergence term in Eq. 2. BPC-CD uses a more complex diver-\ngence called contrastive divergence, while FBPC also applies forward KL divergence but matches\nthe posterior distribution in function space rather than weight space. Following all other prior works,\nwe adopted a three-layer convolutional network with Batch Normalization (BN; Ioffe, 2015) as the\nbase model architecture. For the target dataset, we used the MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998), Fashion-\nMNIST (Xiao et al., 2017), CIFAR10/100 (Krizhevsky, 2009), and Tiny-ImageNet (Le & Yang,\n2015). Additionally, we used image-per-class (ipc) as the unit to count the number of pseudo-\ncoresets. For a k-way classification task, m ipc signifies that a total of mk pseudo-coresets are\ntrained. Along with evaluating classification accuracy (ACC) for each methods, we assess the per-\nformance of the resulting predictive distributions using negative log-likelihood (NLL).\nIn all tables, the best performance is indicated with boldfaced underline, while the second-best value\nis represented with underline in each row. See Appendix E for the additional experimental details.\n5.1\nBAYESIAN MODEL AVERAGING COMPARISON\nWe begin by evaluating the effectiveness of VBPC on five benchmark datasets by comparing the\nBMA performance across different methods. Table 1 clearly demonstrates that VBPC surpasses\nother BPC baselines across all benchmark datasets and ipcs in terms of ACC and NLL. Notably,\nVBPC achieves significantly better NLL, with large margins, while requiring only a single forward\n8\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nTable 2: Comparison with dataset distillation baselines in terms of ACC.

These results empirically validate that the variational distribution trained by VBPC\neffectively captures epistemic uncertainty with a small amount of synthetic data, while keeping\nperformance. Refer to Fig. 1 for examples of VBPC-trained images from the Fashion-MNIST, CI-\nFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets. For more trained VBPC images for other settings, see Appendix G.\nComparison with dataset distillation baselines\nIn addition to the BPC baselines, we compared\nVBPC with two notable dataset distillation baselines, FRePo (Zhou et al., 2022) and RCIG (Loo\net al., 2023), which are recognized for their strong accuracy performance. Since FRePo and RCIG\ndo not employ cross-entropy loss for training, we only report ACC, as comparing NLL would be\nunfair. As shown in Table 2, although VBPC is designed to learn pseudo-coresets to approximate\nthe variational distribution from the training data, it outperforms these dataset distillation baselines,\nfocused mainly on ACC, in nearly all tasks except for CIFAR100 with 1 ipc. The results for each\nmethods (i.e., FRePo, RCIG, and VBPC) in Table 2 were evaluated based on each baseline’s evalu-\nation methods. However, one might question whether the significant performance of VBPC is due to\nthe trained pseudo-coreset itself or the VI method. To verify that VBPC’s performance isn’t solely\ndue to the VI method, we applied our VI method to the baselines’ pseudo-coresets (i.e., FRePo VI\nand RCIG VI) and used FRePo’s method to evaluate VBPC’s pseudo-coresets (i.e., AVBPC). Al-\nthough all methods saw some performance decline, VBPC exhibited a smaller drop, indicating that\nits performance is not solely due to the VI method, but to its ability to effectively learn the varia-\ntional distribution. Full comparisons across all benchmark datasets, available in Appendix F.1, show\nthat VBPC maintains a consistent trend over dataset distillation baselines across all the datasets.\n5.2\nRESULTS ON OUT OF DISTRIBUTION SCENARIOS\nTo further demonstrate that the predictive distribution derived from the VBPC dataset enhances\nrobustness to distributional shifts and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, we assess the performance\nof VBPC and BPC baselines on a corrupted version of the CIFAR10 dataset, known as CIFAR10-\nC (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019). In this case, we use the CIFAR10 10ipc BPC data trained in\nSection 5.1 for all methods and evaluate their performance on the corrupted dataset across 7 different\ntypes of corruption. We assess performance using all 5 levels of severity provided in the dataset.\nTable 3 clearly illustrates that VBPC shows strong robustness against various types of corruption and\nconsistently outperforms other baselines across all corruption types in terms of both ACC and NLL.\nThese findings highlight that the predictive distribution obtained from the VBPC dataset improves\nrobustness to distributional shifts and OOD scenarios.\n9\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nTable 4: Comparison of the VBPC with BPC baselines on the architecture generalization.

As shown in Table 4, VBPC successfully performs VI across various architectures and effec-\ntively constructs predictive distributions through BMA. Notably, while other baselines are sensitive\nto changes in normalization layers, VBPC demonstrates robust learning over diverse feature maps\nthrough the model pool, resulting in strong ACC and NLL performance.\n5.4\nMEMORY ALLOCATION AND TIME REQUIREMENTS\nIn this section, we perform an ablation study to compare memory usage and time requirements be-\ntween the naive computation and the efficient computation for the variance V ∗, Σ∗, and the loss\nterms during both training and inference. As we discussed in Section 3.6, naive loss computa-\ntion requires O(h2) space complexity and O(h3) computational complexity. However, our com-\nputationally efficient loss computation method only requires O(ˆn2) space complexity and O(ˆn3)\ncomputational complexity. Therefore, in the BPC setting where ˆn ≪h typically holds, we can sig-\nnificantly reduce the space and computational complexity required for training. This difference can\nbe observed during the actual training process. As shown in Table 5, our computationally efficient\ntraining reduces the memory requirements for loss computation by nearly half and decreases the\ntraining time to under 20%. Also, we can see the similar results during the BMA procedure. Refer\nto Appendix F to see the various additional ablation studies including ablation on hyperparameters,\npseudo-coreset initialization, and augmentations.\n6\nCONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we present a novel BPC method for VI, referred to as VBPC. By utilizing the Gaussian\nlikelihood, we enable the computation of a closed-form solution for coreset VI, thereby removing the\nneed to unroll the computation graph or use stop gradients. Leveraging this closed-form solution, we\npropose a method to approximate dataset VI without weight sampling during the training of VBPC.\nAdditionally, we introduce a computationally efficient training and BMA inference method that sig-\nnificantly reduces both computational and space complexity. Finally, we empirically show that the\nvariational distribution obtained from VBPC substantially outperforms the predictive distributions\nderived from other BPC baselines in BMA performance across various scenarios.\n10\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nReproducibility Statement.\nWe present comprehensive derivations of all equations in the paper\nin Appendix A. The overall algorithms can be found in Appendix B. Details regarding the datasets,\nmodel architecture, data preprocessing, and hyperparameters are provided in Appendix E.\nEthics Statement.\nWe propose a method that improves the computational and memory efficiency\nof the variational inference method for posterior approximation in Bayesian Neural Networks. Thus\nalthough our approach does not have a direct positive or negative impact on ethical or societal\naspects, it can enhance privacy preservation. Specifically, our method facilitates Bayesian inference\nusing private training data in neural network models by generating synthetic datasets, allowing for\nthe computation of the posterior distribution while maintaining privacy.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was partly supported by Institute of Information & communi-\ncations Technology Planning & Evaluation(IITP) grant funded by the Korea government(MSIT)\n(No.RS-2019-II190075, Artificial Intelligence Graduate School Program(KAIST)), the National\nResearch Foundation of Korea(NRF) grant funded by the Korea government(MSIT) (RS-2021-\nNR056917), Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation(IITP)\ngrant funded by the Korea government(MSIT) (No.RS-2024-00509279, Global AI Frontier Lab),\nand Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation(IITP) grant\nfunded by the Korea government(MSIT) (No.RS-2022-II220713, Meta-learning Applicable to Real-\nworld Problems).\nREFERENCES\nMartín Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen, Craig Citro, Greg S.\nCorrado, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Ian Goodfellow, Andrew\nHarp, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, Yangqing Jia, Rafal Jozefowicz, Lukasz Kaiser, Manjunath\nKudlur, Josh Levenberg, Dandelion Mané, Rajat Monga, Sherry Moore, Derek Murray, Chris\nOlah, Mike Schuster, Jonathon Shlens, Benoit Steiner, Ilya Sutskever, Kunal Talwar, Paul Tucker,\nVincent Vanhoucke, Vijay Vasudevan, Fernanda Viégas, Oriol Vinyals, Pete Warden, Martin Wat-\ntenberg, Martin Wicke, Yuan Yu, and Xiaoqiang Zheng.

To address this issue, we transformed the formulas\nfor m∗\nj and V ∗\nj into equivalent but more numerically stable forms. Specifically, when calculating\nV ∗\nj , we applied the Woodbury formula (Woodbury, 1950).

Since both qλ∗\nS and pλ0\nare Gaussian distributions, the KL divergence can be expressed as follows:\nDKL[qλ∗\nS||pλ0] = 1\n2[k log | det(ρ−1Ih)|\n| det(V ∗)|\n−kh + kTr(ρI−1\nh V ∗) +\nk\nX\nj=1\n(m∗\nj)⊤(ρI−1\nh )m∗\nj]\n(66)\n= 1\n2[k log | det(ρ−1Ih)|\n| det(V ∗)|\n−kh + kTr(ρV ∗) + ρ∥m∗∥2]\n(67)\nc= 1\n2[−k log | det(V ∗)| + kρTr(V ∗) + ρ∥m∗∥2].\n(68)\nHere, we have to reduce the memory requirements for the det(V ∗) and the Tr(V ∗) as they require\nO(h2) memory to compute directly from V ∗. For the det V ∗, we used Weinstein-Aronszajn iden-\n18\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\ntity (Pozrikidis, 2014) which results as follows:\ndet V ∗= det(ρIh + γ\nβS\nΦ⊤Φ)−1\n(69)\n=\n1\ndet(ρIh +\nγ\nβS Φ⊤Φ)\n(70)\n=\n1\nρh det(Ih +\nγ\nρβS Φ⊤Φ)\n(71)\n=\n1\nρh det(Iˆn +\nγ\nρβS ΦΦ⊤).\n(72)\nThus we have:\nlog det V ∗= −h log ρ −log det\n\u0012\nIˆn +\nγ\nρβS\nΦΦ⊤\n\u0013\n(73)\nc= −log det\n\u0012\nIˆn +\nγ\nρβS\nΦΦ⊤\n\u0013\n.\n(74)\nAlso we can compute trace as follows:\nTr(V ∗) = Tr\n \nβS\nγ\n \nγ\nρβS\nIh −\n\u0012 γ\nρβS\n\u00132\nΦ⊤\n\u0012\nIˆn +\nγ\nρβS\nΦΦ⊤\n\u0013−1\nΦ\n!!\n(75)\n= βS\nγ\n \nγh\nρβS\n−\n\u0012 γ\nρβS\n\u00132\nTr\n \nΦ⊤\n\u0012\nIˆn +\nγ\nρβS\nΦΦ⊤\n\u0013−1\nΦ\n!!\n(76)\n= βS\nγ\n \nγh\nρβS\n−\n\u0012 γ\nρβS\n\u00132\nTr\n \u0012\nIˆn +\nγ\nρβS\nΦΦ⊤\n\u0013−1\nΦΦ⊤\n!!\n(77)\nc= −\nγ\nβSρ2 Tr\n \u0012\nIˆn +\nγ\nρβS\nΦΦ⊤\n\u0013−1\nΦΦ⊤\n!\n.\n(78)\nThese computations allow us to reduce memory requirements during training from O(h2) to O(ˆn2),\nwhich represents a significant reduction when dealing with a high-dimensional feature space h.\nMemory Efficient Bayesian Model Averaging\nFor the variance V ∗we computed corresponds to\na full covariance matrix, leading to a memory cost of h2. To address this, rather than calculating V ∗\nexplicitly, we need a memory-efficient approach for conducting BMA on test points. This can be\ndone easily by calculating Σ∗as follows:\nΣ∗= ΦteV ∗Φ⊤\nte\n(79)\n= βS\nγ\n \nγ\nρβS\nΦteΦ⊤\nte −\n\u0012 γ\nρβS\n\u00132\nΦteΦ⊤\n\u0012\nIˆn +\nγ\nρβS\nΦΦ⊤\n\u0013−1\nΦΦ⊤\nte\n!\n,\n(80)\nwhere Φte ∈Rnte×h denotes the feature matrix of nte number of test points. Then by storing Φ ∈\nRˆn×h and (Iˆn +\nγ\nρβS ΦΦ⊤)−1 ∈Rˆn×ˆn instead of V ∗, we can reduce the memory requirements to\nˆnh + ˆn2, which is much smaller than h2.\nB\nALGORITHM FOR TRAINING AND INFERENCE\nIn this section, we present algorithms for training and inference. In Algorithm 1, the overall training\nprocedures are presented, and note that we utilize the model pool M to prevent overfitting. We\nalso use the Gaussian likelihood to update the weights contained in the model pool. Additionally,\nin Algorithm 2, we present computationally and memory-efficient variational inference and BMA\nmethods. Here, we store Φ and (Iˆn +\nγ\nρβS ΦΦ⊤)−1 instead of directly computing V ∗.\n19\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nAlgorithm 1 Training Variational Bayesian Pseudo-Coreset (VBPC).\nRequire: Training dataset D, learning rate δ.\nEnsure: Learned synthetic dataset S∗.\n1: Initialize:\nInitialize synthetic dataset distribution S with ˆn pairs of (ˆxi, ˆyi).\n2: Initialize:\nRandomly initialize P different θis and construct a model pool M.\n3: while not converged do\n4:\nSample training batch B from training distribution D.\n5:\nUniformly sample θi from model pool M and construct feature map ϕ.\n6:\nEfficiently compute loss Eq. 27 with Eq. 29, Eq. 30 and Eq. 31.\n7:\nUpdate ˆxis and ˆyis using gradient descent: ˆxi ←ˆxi −δ∇ˆxi ˜LD, ˆyi ←ˆyi −δ∇ˆyi ˜LD\n8:\nUpdate θi with S and the Gaussian likelihood.\n9:\nReplace θi in M with updated θi.\n10:\nIf θi ∈M has been updated T times, reinitialize θi and replace θi in M.\n11: end while\nAlgorithm 2 Variational inference and Bayesian Model Averaging using VBPC.\nRequire: Learned synthetic dataset S∗, MODE which is VI or BMA, and test dataset T .\nEnsure: Variational posterior or Bayesian Model Averaged output prediction.\n1: Initialize:\nRandomly initialize θ.\n2: while not converged do\n3:\nUpdate θ with Gaussian likelihood and S∗.\n4: end while\n5: Compute m∗\nj, Φ, and (Iˆn +\nγ\nρβS ΦΦ⊤)−1 with (ˆxi, ˆyi)s.\n6: if MODE == VI then\n7:\nCompute V ∗with Eq. 21.\n8: else if MODE==BMA then\n9:\nCompute Σ∗with Eq. 31.\n10:\nCompute approximate expected predictive distribution for T similar to Eq. 25.\n11: end if\nC\nADDITIONAL RELATED WORKS\nBayesian Pseudo-Coreset\nAs discussed in Section 1 and Section 2, the large scale of modern\nreal-world datasets leads to significant computational costs when performing SGMCMC (Welling\n& Teh, 2011; Ahn et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2015) or variational inference (Blei\net al., 2017; Fiedler & Lucia, 2023) to approximate posterior distributions. To address this issue,\nprevious works, such as Bayesian Coreset (BC; Campbell & Broderick, 2018; 2019; Campbell &\nBeronov, 2019), have proposed selecting a small subset from the full training dataset so that the\nposterior distribution built from this subset closely approximates the posterior from the full dataset.\nHowever, Manousakas et al. (2020) highlighted that simply selecting a subset of the training data\nis insufficient to accurately approximate high-dimensional posterior distributions, and introduced\nBPC for simple logistic regression tasks. Later, Kim et al. (2022) extended BPC to BNNs, using\nreverse KL divergence, forward KL divergence, and Wasserstein distance as measures for D in Eq. 2\nto assess the difference between the full posterior and the BPC posterior. Subsequent works have\nused contrastive divergence (Tiwary et al., 2024) or calculated divergence in function space (Kim\net al., 2023) using Function-space Bayesian Neural Network (FBNN; Rudner et al., 2021; 2022).\nHowever, as discussed in Section 1, computational and memory overhead remains an issue when\ntraining BPC and during inference using BMA.\nDataset Distillation\nSimilar to but distinct from BPC, dataset distillation (Wang et al., 2018) meth-\nods aim to train a pseudo-coreset that preserves the essential information contained in the full train-\ning dataset. These methods ensure that the model trained on the pseudo-coreset learns information\nthat allows it to perform similarly to a model trained on the full dataset. This approach enables com-\nputationally efficient training of new models using the pseudo-coreset and helps prevent catastrophic\nforgetting in continual learning scenarios, leading to more stable learning.\n20\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nTo train these dataset distillation methods, a bilevel optimization problem must be solved, requiring\nthe computation of meta-gradients through unrolled inner optimization to find the solution to the\nouter optimization problem. To address this challenge, various learning methods have been pro-\nposed in the dataset distillation field, which can be broadly categorized into three approaches: 1)\nusing surrogate objectives, 2) closed-form approximations, and 3) employing the implicit function\ntheorem.\nExamples of works in the first category include Zhao & Bilen (2021), Zhao & Bilen (2023), and\nCazenavette et al. (2022), where Zhao & Bilen (2021) uses gradient matching, Zhao & Bilen (2023)\nfocuses on feature distribution alignment, and Cazenavette et al. (2022) employs a trajectory match-\ning objective. Papers in the second category, Nguyen et al. (2020) and Zhou et al. (2022), calculate\nclosed-form solutions by using the Neural Tangent Kernel (Jacot et al., 2018) and Neural Network\nGaussian Process Kernel (Lee et al., 2017), respectively. Lastly, Loo et al. (2023), representing the\nthird category, uses the implicit function theorem to compute gradients for unrolled inner optimiza-\ntion, allowing for the updating of the pseudo-coreset.\nVariational Inference\nVariational inference (Bishop, 2006; Blundell et al., 2015; Blei et al.,\n2017), one of the most general methods for approximating most posterior distributions, is a tech-\nnique that approximates the target posterior distribution using a variational distribution, which has\na well-known and manageable form. The parameters of the variational distribution are learned by\nminimizing the KL divergence between the target posterior distribution and the variational distribu-\ntion. Although using all the parameters of the variational distribution can enhance its expressiveness,\nallowing for more accurate approximations, two common approaches are typically employed to ad-\ndress the computational and memory challenges that arise when handling the large scale of BNN\nweights: 1) mean-field approximation (Blundell et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2024), and 2) computing the\nposterior distribution for only a subset of the network parameters (Dusenberry et al., 2020; Fiedler\n& Lucia, 2023; Harrison et al., 2024a). In both of these cases, the parameters of the variational\ndistribution are optimized either directly using gradient descent methods to minimize the KL diver-\ngence (Blundell et al., 2015; Dusenberry et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2024), or a closed-form solution is\nfound (Wang & Blei, 2013).\nD\nADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON VBPC\nFuture work direction\nHere, we would like to discuss some concerns and challenges we fore-\nsee in adopting the Laplace approximation on the softmax likelihood instead of using variational\ninference with Gaussian likelihood.\nSpecifically, if we switch from using a Gaussian likelihood to employing a softmax likelihood with\nLaplace approximation for variational inference, there are two cases to consider: (1) using Laplace\napproximation on the last-layer weights without any updates, and (2) updating the last-layer weights\nwith some gradient descent steps before applying Laplace approximation.\nIn the first case—applying Laplace approximation to weights without updating the last layer—two\nmain issues may arise. First, the Laplace approximation assumes that the weights are near a mini-\nmum, allowing for the approximation of the first-order term in Taylor expansion as zero. However,\nthis assumption may not hold for untrained weights, leading to significant approximation error.\nAdditionally, the computational burden of calculating the Hessian for Laplace approximation is\nsubstantial, and the need to compute gradients through this Hessian during pseudo-coreset updates\nincreases the computational load further.\nIn the second case—updating the last layer weights with gradient steps before applying Laplace\napproximation—there’s the advantage of reducing Taylor expansion error. However, this approach\ninvolves a large computational graph, which can be problematic due to the computational expense\ntypical in bilevel optimization settings. Additionally, the need to compute gradients through the\nHessian remains a challenge.\nOverall, we believe that solving these issues could lead to new meaningful future work for VBPC.\nLimitations of the Last-Layer Approximation\nThere might be concerns that considering the\nposterior distribution of only the last layer weights, rather than the entire parameter set, could limit\n21\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nthe model’s ability to capture uncertainty effectively, especially as the model size increases and\ntasks become more complex. We fully agree that this is a valid concern and would like to provide a\ndiscussion based on related findings.\nSpecifically, Harrison et al. (2024b) provides extensive empirical evidence on the effectiveness of\nlast-layer variational inference. Their experiments span diverse tasks, including regression with UCI\ndatasets, image classification using a Wide ResNet model, and sentiment classification leveraging\nLLM features from the OPT-175B model. They compared their method with other Bayesian in-\nference approaches such as Dropout, Ensemble methods, and Laplace approximation for the full\nmodel. Their results demonstrate that even though last-layer variational inference focuses solely\non the final layer weights, it achieves performance comparable to other comprehensive Bayesian\ninference techniques across various tasks.\nThese findings indicate that while conducting Bayesian inference on the full set of weights in a\nneural network could potentially lead to more precise uncertainty estimation, employing last-layer\nvariational inference is still effective in capturing meaningful uncertainty.\nWe believe that extending VBPC to incorporate full-weight variational inference could be a promis-\ning direction for future work, offering the potential to further enhance the method’s uncertainty\nestimation capabilities. We will include this discussion in the final manuscript to provide a balanced\nperspective and acknowledge possible avenues for improvement.\nE\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nOur VBPC code implementation is built on the official FRePo (Zhou et al., 2022)1 codebase. The im-\nplementation utilizes the following libraries, all available under the Apache-2.0 license2: JAX (Brad-\nbury et al., 2018), Flax (Babuschkin et al., 2020), Optax (Babuschkin et al., 2020), TensorFlow\nDatasets (Abadi et al., 2015), and Augmax3. For the baseline methods, we used the official code\nimplementations provided for each. All experiments, except those on the Tiny-ImageNet (Le &\nYang, 2015) dataset, were performed on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU machines, while Tiny-ImageNet\nexperiments were conducted on NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs.\nE.1\nDATASETS\nDatasets for the Bayesian Model Averaging comparison\nFor the BMA comparison experi-\nments, we utilize 5 different datasets: 1) MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998), 2) Fashion-MNIST (Xiao\net al., 2017), 3) CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky, 2009), 4) CIFAR100 (Krizhevsky, 2009), and 5) Tiny-\nImageNet (Le & Yang, 2015).\n• MNIST: The MNIST dataset4 contains 10 classes of handwritten digits with 60,000 train-\ning images and 10,000 test images, each with dimensions of 28 × 28 × 1. All images were\nnormalized using a mean of [0.1307] and a standard deviation of [0.3081].\n• Fashion-MNIST: The Fashion-MNIST dataset5 consists of 10 classes of fashion article\nimages, with 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each with dimensions of 28×\n28 × 1. Images were normalized using a mean of [0.2861] and a standard deviation of\n[0.3530].\n• CIFAR-10/100:\nThe CIFAR-10/100 dataset6 contains 10/100 classes, with 50,000\ntraining images and 10,000 test images sourced from the 80 Million Tiny Images\ndataset (Torralba et al., 2008).\nEach image has dimensions of 32 × 32 × 3.\nFor\nCIFAR-10, images were normalized with a mean of [0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465] and a stan-\ndard deviation of [0.2470, 0.2435, 0.2616], while CIFAR-100 images used a mean of\n[0.5071, 0.4866, 0.4409] and a standard deviation of [0.2673, 0.2564, 0.2762].\n1https://github.com/yongchaoz/FRePo\n2https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n3https://github.com/khdlr/augmax\n4https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/\n5https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist\n6https://www.cs.toronto.edu/˜kriz/cifar.html\n22\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n• Tiny-ImageNet: The Tiny-ImageNet dataset7 contains 200 classes, with 100,000 train-\ning images and 10,000 test images. Each image has dimensions of 64 × 64 × 3. Im-\nages were normalized using a mean of [0.4759, 0.4481, 0.3926] and a standard deviation of\n[0.2763, 0.2687, 0.2813].\nDatasets for the Out of Distribution scenarios\nFor the distribution shift and OOD scenarios, we\nuse CIFAR10-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019), which includes seven corruption types with five\nseverity for each corruption type: 1) Gaussian Blur, 2) JPEG Compression, 3) Snow, 4) Zoom Blur,\n5) Pixelate, 6) Defocus Blur, and 7) Motion Blur.\n• CIFAR10-C: The CIFAR10-C dataset8 consists of 10 classes, with 50,000 test images\nfor each corruption type.\nIt applies various corruptions to 10,000 test images from\nCIFAR10, with five levels of severity, each containing 10,000 images.\nThe images\nare normalized using the same mean [0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465] and standard deviation\n[0.2470, 0.2435, 0.2616] as the CIFAR10 dataset.\nE.2\nMODEL ARCHITECTURE\nModel architecture utilized for the Bayesian Model Averaging and Out of Distribution tasks\nFollowing previous works (Kim et al., 2022; 2023; Tiwary et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2022), we used\na convolutional neural network (CNN) for the Bayesian Model Averaging comparison experiment\nand the Out of Distribution experiment. This model is composed of several blocks, each consisting\nof a 3×3 convolution kernel, pre-defined normalization layer, Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU; Agarap,\n2018) activation, and a 2 × 2 average pooling layer with a stride of 2. For datasets with resolutions\nof 28 × 28 × 1 and 32 × 32 × 3, we used 3 blocks, and for datasets with a resolution of 64 ×\n64 × 3, we used 4 blocks. Following Zhou et al. (2022), we increase twice the number of filters\nwhen the feature dimension was halved, to prevent the feature dimensions from becoming too small.\nAdditionally, by default, we used the Batch Normalization (Ioffe, 2015) layer for normalization\nunless stated otherwise. For initializing model weights, we conducted experiments using the Lecun\nInitialization (Cun et al., 1998) method, which is the default initialization method of the Flax library.\nThis configuration was applied both during the model pool in the VBPC training process and in the\nevaluation phase.\nModel architecture utilized for the Architecture Generalization task\nFor the Architecture\ngeneralization experiments, we incorporate three additional normalization layers and three ad-\nditional model architectures. The normalization layers include Instance Normalization (Ulyanov,\n2016), Identity map, and Group Normalization (Wu & He, 2018). For the model architectures, we\ninclude AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), VGG (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014), and ResNet (He\net al., 2016). Initially, we evaluate all baselines by replacing Batch Normalization in the convolution\nlayers with the three alternative normalization methods, referring to these as CNN-IN, CNN-NN,\nand CNN-GN, respectively. Next, we use the three additional model architectures for evaluation.\nSince AlexNet does not have normalization layers in its original design, we retain this structure and\nrefer to it as AlexNet-NN. For VGG and ResNet, we use VGG11 with Group Normalization and\nResNet18 with Batch Normalization. These models are denoted as VGG11-GN and ResNet18-BN.\nE.3\nPSEUDO-CORESET INITIALIZATION, PREPROCESSING, AND AUGMENTATION\nInitialization\nBuilding on prior works (Kim et al., 2022; 2023; Tiwary et al., 2024; Zhou et al.,\n2022), we initialize the pseudo-coreset by randomly sampling images and labels from the original\ntraining dataset using a fixed sampling seed. For the labels, following Zhou et al. (2022), we initial-\nize them with scaled, mean-centered one-hot vectors corresponding to each image, where the scaling\nfactor is determined by the number of classes k, specifically\n1\n√\nk/10. Here, we train both images and\nlabels during training.\n7https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/\n8https://github.com/hendrycks/robustness?tab=readme-ov-file\n23\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nData preprocessing and Augmentation\nFollowing previous works (Kim et al., 2022; Tiwary\net al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2022), we perform standard preprocessing on each dataset, with the ad-\ndition of ZCA (Kessy et al., 2018) transformations for all datasets with 3 channels. Consistent with\nZhou et al. (2022), we apply a regularization strength of λ = 0.1 across all datasets. Similar to\nprevious works (Kim et al., 2022; 2023; Tiwary et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2022), we apply the fol-\nlowing augmentations to the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets: ‘Gaussian noise’, ‘brightness’,\n‘crop’, ‘rotate’, ‘translate’, and ‘cutout’. For all other datasets, we use ‘flip’, ‘Gaussian noise’,\n‘color’, ‘crop’, ‘rotate’, ‘translate’, and ‘cutout’ augmentations. These augmentations are applied\nboth during the training of the Bayesian pseudo-coreset and during evaluation with them.\nE.4\nHYPERPARAMTERS\nHyperparameters during training VBPC\nFollowing previous works (Kim et al., 2022; 2023;\nTiwary et al., 2024), we select 1, 10, or 50 images per class for all datasets when training VBPC\nfor evaluation. For βS, we use ˆn, which corresponds to the number of pseudo-coresets in each\nexperiment. This setup is designed to control the gradient magnitude by averaging, rather than\nsumming, the expected likelihood, while maintaining the influence of the KL divergence for stable\ntraining. For βD, we used 1e-8 as the default value, and when adjusted, it was selected from the\nrange [1e-6, 1e-7, 1e-8] across all experiments. For ρ and γ, we set the default values to ρ = 1.0 and\nγ = 100.0 for the ipc 1 and ipc 10 settings, and ρ = 10.0 and γ = 100.0 for the ipc 50 settings.\nExcept for the CIFAR100 ipc 10 setting where we utilize ρ = 10.0 and γ = 100.0 for the default\nsetting. When tuning these parameters, we adjusted them on a log scale in steps of 10 within the\nrange of [-5, 5]. Following the default settings in Zhou et al. (2022), we set the number of models\nstored in the model pool, P, to 10. Additionally, as per Zhou et al. (2022), we set the number of\ntraining steps, T, for each model in the model pool to 100. For the model pool optimizer, we used\nthe Adam (Kingma, 2014) optimizer with a fixed learning rate of 0.0003 across all experiments. For\nthe pseudo-coreset optimizer, we also used the Adam optimizer by default, with a cosine learning\nrate schedule starting at 0.003 for both images and labels. Lastly, we used a batch size of 1024 and\ntrained for 0.5 million steps to ensure sufficient convergence.\nHyperparameters during variational inference and Bayesian Model Averaging\nFor all exper-\niments, the hyperparameters γ, ρ, and βS used during evaluation were the same as those used for\npseudo-coreset training in the corresponding experiment. The optimizer used for training the models\nduring evaluation was the Adam optimizer with a constant learning rate of 0.0003. The number of\ntraining steps for each model was as follows: for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, 100 steps for 1 ipc,\n500 steps for 10 ipc, and 1000 steps for 50 ipc. For CIFAR10, 200 steps for 1 ipc, 2000 steps for 10\nipc, and 5000 steps for 50 ipc. For CIFAR100, 2000 steps for both 1 ipc and 10 ipc, and 5000 steps\nfor 50 ipc. Lastly, for Tiny-ImageNet, 1000 steps were used for 1 ipc and 2000 steps for 10 ipc.\nF\nADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT\nF.1\nFULL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON BAYESIAN MODEL AVERAGING COMPARISON\nHere, we report the full experimental results for Section 5.1. We report results for FRePo and\nRCIG across the entire benchmark dataset and varying IPC settings additional to Table 1. Table 6\nclearly demonstrates that VBPC surpasses other BPC baselines across all benchmark datasets and\nIPC settings in terms of ACC and NLL. Notably, VBPC achieves significantly better NLL, with large\nmargins, while requiring only a single forward pass to conduct BMA. Although VBPC is designed to\nlearn pseudo-coresets that approximate the variational distribution derived from the training dataset,\nit outperforms dataset distillation baselines, which primarily focus on achieving high ACC, in nearly\nall tasks, except for CIFAR100 with 1 IPC and Tiny-ImageNet. These results empirically validate\nthat the variational distribution trained by VBPC effectively captures epistemic uncertainty with a\nsmall amount of synthetic data, while maintaining high performance.\nComparison with dataset distillation baselines\nIn Section 5.1, the performance was evaluated\nbased on the training and evaluation methods proposed by each baseline’s original papers. However,\none might question whether the significant performance of VBPC is due to the trained pseudo-\ncoreset itself or the VI method. To address this, and to validate that the significant performance of\n24\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nTable 6: Comparison of the VBPC with BPC and additional dataset distillation baselines for the\nbenchmark datasets.

Results in Table 7 and Table 6\nclearly show that the performance significantly drops for all baselines compared to their original\nperformance. This validates that the performance is not solely attributable to the VI method, and\ndemonstrates that VBPC successfully learns to approximate the variational distribution effectively.\nF.2\nADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT RESULTS ON LARGE DATASET AND CONTINUAL LEARNING\nTo further highlight the ability of VBPC to handle tasks that pose challenges for other BPC baselines,\nwe conduct additional experiments on more large datasets and the continual learning setting.\nLarge Datasets\nFirst, to show that our method is uniquely scalable to large datasets compared\nto other BPC methods, we conducted additional experiments on the ImageNetWoof (128x128x3)\ndataset (Howard, 2020) and the ImageNet1k (64x64x3) dataset(Russakovsky et al., 2015). Addi-\ntionally, we included an experiment in a continual learning scenario to validate that our method\nperforms better in practical scenarios.\nWe conducted experiments on the ImageWoof (128x128x3) dataset with ipc 1 and ipc 10 settings,\nas well as the resized ImageNet1k (64x64x3) dataset with ipc 1 and ipc 2 settings, to demonstrate\nthe scalability of our method to high-resolution images and larger datasets. Unlike existing BPC\nbaselines, which encountered memory issues and failed to train due to out-of-memory errors on an\nRTX 3090 GPU as the image resolution and number of classes increased, our method successfully\ncompleted training. Table 8 clearly shows that VBPC significantly outperforms other baselines with\na large margin for both the ImageWoof and resized ImageNet1k datasets.\nContinual Learning\nNext, we validated the practical effectiveness of our method through con-\ntinual learning experiments using pseudo-coreset images learned by each method. We followed the\n25\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nTable 8: Experiments on the scalability utilizing ImageWoof and resized ImageNet datasets.

(2022); Zhao & Bilen (2021), where class-balanced\ntraining examples are greedily stored in memory, and the model is trained from scratch using only\nthe latest memory. Specifically, we performed a 5-step class incremental learning experiment on\nCIFAR100 with an ipc 20 setting, following the class splits proposed in Zhou et al. (2022); Zhao &\nBilen (2021). Table 9 demonstrates that VBPC consistently outperforms other baselines across all\nsteps, confirming its superior practicality and effectiveness in real-world continual learning scenar-\nios.\nF.3\nADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS ON OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION DATA\nTo further validate the effectiveness of VBPC, We have conducted additional Out-of-Distribution\n(OOD) detection experiments and reported the results. The metrics we evaluate include AUROC,\nAUPR-In, and AUPR-Out, where higher values indicate better performance.\nWe used models\ntrained with the CIFAR10 IPC 10 setting and evaluated them on CIFAR100, TinyImageNet, and\nSVHN (Netzer et al., 2011) datasets as OOD datasets.\nThe results, presented in Table 10, demonstrate that the pseudo-coreset learned by VBPC performs\nrobustly in OOD detection scenarios. These findings, combined with the corruption experiments in\nthe main paper, validate the effectiveness and robustness of VBPC under diverse and challenging\nevaluation conditions.\nF.4\nANALYSIS ON COMPUTATIONAL COSTS AND TRAINING TIME\nIn this section, we performed analyses focusing on two aspects of computational cost.\nCost of training the pseudo-coreset\nAs mentioned in the Section 1, conventional BPC methods\nrelying on SGMCMC require the creation of expert trajectories, which are training trajectories de-\nrived from the full dataset. Each dataset typically involves training with 10 different random seeds\nfor these trajectories, making this step computationally expensive. Since all BPC baselines share\nand utilize these precomputed trajectories, their associated computational cost can be considered a\nshared overhead.\nTo isolate the computational cost of training the pseudo-coreset itself, we measured the wall-clock\ntime required for pseudo-coreset optimization by each method. The results of this comparison are\n26\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nTable 10: AUROC, AUPR-In, and AUPR-Out results for the OOD detection task with a model\ntrained with the learned pseudo-coresets.

Each sample incurs significant\ntraining and inference costs, which grow linearly with the number of samples.\nTo quantify this difference, we measured the wall-clock time for inference across methods, with\nresults presented in Table 12. These results highlight how VBPC achieves superior efficiency during\ninference by avoiding the high computational costs associated with sampling-based approaches.\nThese analyses demonstrate VBPC’s ability to perform Bayesian inference efficiently, both in terms\nof pseudo-coreset training and inference, and further reinforce the computational advantages of our\nmethod.\nF.5\nABLATION ON RANDOM INITIALIZATION\nSince our method initializes the pseudo-coreset by randomly sampling images and labels from the\noriginal training dataset, following previous works (Kim et al., 2022; 2023; Tiwary et al., 2024;\nZhou et al., 2022), we conducted an ablation experiment using random initialization for the pseudo-\ncoreset. In this experiment, we first randomly initialized the pseudo-coreset by sampling pixel values\nfrom a uniform distribution Unif[0, 1]. We then trained the images after normalizing them with the\npredefined mean and variance for each dataset reported in Appendix E.1. We conducted this ablation\nexperiment on the CIFAR10/100 1 ipc and 10 ipc settings. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 clearly illustrate that\nVBPC can effectively learn semantic information even when initialized randomly. Specifically, in\nthe CIFAR10 ipc 1 case shown in the top figures of both Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the images after training\nappear similar, whether they were initialized randomly or sampled from the training dataset. Also\nTable 13 shows that randomly initialized VBPC shows comparable performance compared to the\nVBPC.\nF.6\nABLATION ON PSEUDO-CORESET OPTIMIZER\nSince we use the Adam optimizer for training VBPC, which differs from the default choice in pre-\nvious work (Zhou et al., 2022), we conducted an ablation experiment on the optimizer. Following\n27\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nTable 12: Wall clock time results for inference using learned pseudo-coresets. We measure the in-\nference time for evaluating all the test data from the CIFAR10 test dataset. After finishing training\nthe pseudo-coresets, the inference cost for the all baselines are same because they only need SGM-\nCMC and BMA with same number of datasets and weight samples.\nMethod\nBPC-CD BPC-rKL FBPC BPC-fKL VBPC\nTimes (s)\n165\n165\n165\n165\n20\nFigure 2: Learned VBPC images from the random initialization for the CIFAR10 ipc 1 (above) and\nipc 10 (below) cases. The left figure shows the random images sampled from the uniform distribution\nand the right figure shows the trained VBPC images starting from the left images. Training from\nrandom initialization successfully learns semantic information from the full dataset.\nZhou et al. (2022), we used the LAMB (You et al., 2019) optimizer with a cosine learning rate\nschedule for this ablation. We conduct this ablation experiment on the CIFAR10 1 ipc and 10 ipc\nsettings. As seen in Fig. 4, although there are minor differences, the images trained with the LAMB\nand Adam optimizers are largely similar when starting from the same pseudo-coreset initial images.\nAdditionally, Table 14 demonstrates that our method effectively learns pseudo-coreset with varying\noptimizers, closely approximating the variational distribution of the full training dataset.\nF.7\nABLATION ON MODEL POOL MAXIMUM UPDATE STEPS\nAs mentioned in Appendix E.4, we set T = 100 as the maximum update step for the weights in\nthe model pool M across all experiments. The model pool was introduced to address VBPC’s\noverfitting issue, as the weights in the model pool are trained for T steps, leading to a variety of\nfeature maps. This prevents VBPC from learning based on a single feature map. To investigate\nthe effect of T, we plan to conduct an ablation study to examine how changes in T impact image\nquality and performance. We conducted an ablation experiment on the CIFAR100 ipc 10 task with\nTable 13: Comparison between the random initialization and initialization with randomly sampled\nimages.

As shown in Fig. 5, the images learned with different maximum update\nsteps appear visually similar.

This can be crucial and effective for learning\na more informative BPC, as the mean of the pseudo-coreset variational distribution depends on the\nlabel.

Also, results presented in Table 16 clearly shows that the BMA performance\nwith VBPC variational distribution largely drops without label learning. These results validate that\nlearning the label is important for the successful VBPC training.\nF.9\nABLATION ON GAUSSIAN NOISE AUGMENTATION\nDuring VBPC training, we apply Gaussian noise augmentation. Based on previous findings that\nadding Gaussian noise to images during neural network training improves robustness to various\nimage corruptions (Rusak et al., 2020), we incorporate Gaussian noise during VBPC training. This\nhelps the learned pseudo-coreset dataset produce a variational posterior that is robust to unseen\nmodel structures and corrupted test datasets. Specifically, we add Gaussian noise sampled from\nN(0, 0.01) after normalizing the images using the predefined mean and standard deviation for all\ntasks. We conduct the ablation experiment on the existence of this Gaussian Noise during training\nVBPC utilizing CIFAR10/100 1 ipc and 10 ipc settings. As clearly seen in the CIFAR10 1 ipc case in\nFig. 7, training with Gaussian noise results in much clearer and brighter images. In contrast, without\nGaussian noise, the model tends to learn visually similar features in the background, unlike the cases\nwhere noise is applied. Table 17 confirms that, as expected, the overall performance decreases when\nGaussian noise augmentation is not applied, compared to VBPC with Gaussian noise augmentation.\nTable 15: Ablation results on the model pool maximum update steps.

This enables the model to achieve sufficient BMA performance even\nbefore the pseudo-coreset learning is fully completed. As shown in Table 20, the model exhibits\nslightly lower performance during initial steps, such as at 400 or 800 steps, compared to the best\nperformance. However, after these early stages, the performance becomes nearly identical to the\nfinal convergence step at 2000 steps. These results further demonstrate that our VBPC approach\nallows for fast and efficient posterior approximation.\nG\nTRAINED VBPC IMAGES\nIn this section, we present the images learned under the ipc 1, 10, and 50 settings for MNIST,\nFashion-MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny-ImageNet. To avoid overwhelming the report\nwith too many images, we have limited the number of reported images to a maximum of 100 per\ntask.\nG.1\nTAKE-HOME MESSAGE FROM LEARNED IMAGES\nRegarding the learned pseudo-coreset images for CIFAR10, the results can be found in Fig. 12 and\nleft figure of Fig. 13, showing the outcomes for ipc values of 1 and 10. These images reveal several\ninteresting aspects of how VBPC captures information.\nFirst, both ipc 1 and ipc 10 images show that VBPC effectively learns features associated with\nspecific classes, such as “horse\" or “automobile,\" as can be visually confirmed. This indicates that\nthe pseudo-coreset images retain class-relevant information necessary for approximating the original\ndataset’s posterior distribution. When comparing ipc 1 and ipc 10, there are notable differences. In\nthe case of ipc 1, where only a single image per class is available, VBPC attempts to encode as\nmany class-specific features as possible into a single image. As a result, the learned image appears\nto incorporate multiple discriminative features from the class symmetrically. In contrast, with ipc\n32\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nTable 19: Ablation results on the hyperparamer ρ.

This leads to a greater diversity of features being captured across the pseudo-\ncoreset, enabling a more comprehensive representation of the class.\nAdditionally, both ipc 1 and ipc 10 images often include low-level features beyond the main class-\nrelevant ones. These features likely help capture the dataset’s variability and ensure the learned\npseudo-coreset maintains a close approximation of the original data distribution.\nThese observations suggest that VBPC is effective in compressing the dataset while retaining essen-\ntial information. The learned images illustrate how VBPC balances feature extraction and informa-\ntion retention to ensure that the variational posterior distribution learned using the pseudo-coreset\nclosely approximates the one learned using the full dataset. This further validates the interpretability\nand utility of VBPC in various tasks.\n33\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nFigure 8: Visualization of learned VBPC images for the MNIST ipc 1.\nFigure 9: Visualization of learned VBPC images for the MNIST ipc10 (left) and ipc50 (right).\nFigure 10: Visualization of learned VBPC images for the Fashion-MNIST ipc1.\nFigure 11: Visualization of learned VBPC images for the Fashion-MNIST ipc10 (left) and ipc50\n(right).\nFigure 12: Learned VBPC images for the CIFAR10 ipc 1 case.\n34\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nFigure 13: Visualization of learned VBPC images for the CIFAR10 ipc10 (left) and ipc50 (right).\nFigure 14: Visualization of learned VBPC images for the CIFAR100 ipc1.\n35\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nFigure 15: Visualization of learned VBPC images for the CIFAR100 ipc10 (left) and ipc50 (right).\nFigure 16: Visualization of learned VBPC images for the Tiny-ImageNet ipc1 (left) and ipc10\n(right).\n36\n\n\n"}

ACM 37, 4, Article 111 (August 2018), 17 pages.\nhttps://doi.org/XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX\n1\nIntroduction\nThe field of building energy consumption prediction with sensor networks [11, 27] has made\nsignificant advancements over the past decades with the improvement of data-driven approaches [1,\n30, 33] and smart metering infrastructure [47]. These have enabled the collection of vast amounts\nof data and the generation of valuable insights through machine learning [10, 39]. Initially, research\nin the 1990s utilized statistical models and machine learning techniques [24, 31] such as artificial\nneural networks (ANN) [38] and support vector machines (SVM) [22], which have later evolved into\nmore complex ensemble methods that reduce errors through model diversity. Despite numerous\nstudies, comparing different prediction methods is challenging due to their customization for\nspecific contexts [24]. While numerous building energy prediction methods have been devised over\nthe past thirty years [2], there remains no widespread agreement on the most effective methods for\ndifferent types of buildings. Moreover, many of the developed techniques are not readily accessible\nto the broader research community. It has been observed, that a majority with 33 out of 42 of\nprediction studies using measured data implemented and tested the models on a single building [31].\nTo address this issue, the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III (GEPIII) Competition [24, 31, 32],\nheld in 2019, sought to enhance building energy consumption forecasting using machine learning\nmodels for different types of buildings. This competition series, which began in 1993, has served\nas a cornerstone for crowdsourced benchmarking of time-series data in the building industry\nand is therefore still used. The competition aimed to identify the best methods for hourly energy\nprediction in commercial buildings and disseminate the accumulated modeling knowledge to the\nwider academic and practitioner communities [24].\nIn recent years, integrating physical process representations into neural networks has enhanced\nthe modeling of dynamic systems by capturing temporal dependencies in real-world data [36, 37].\nState Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as a powerful alternative to Transformer architectures [16,\n17, 19, 40, 44], offering efficient handling of long-range dependencies while maintaining lower\ncomputational complexity. As first Deep SSM, the Structured State Space Models (S4) [17] and its\nderivative, S4D [19] have been introduced. The S4 framework introduced the handling of sequential\ndata by utilizing the structured state space representation’s using HiPPO (High-order Polynomial\nProjection Operator) matrices’ inherent ability to capture long-range dependencies [17]. Building\nupon S4, S4D further refines this approach by introducing diagonal matrices that enhance the\nmodel’s numerical robustness [19]. This foundational work in S4 and S4D sets the basis for our\nproposed S4ConvD model, a novel extension of S4D for energy consumption prediction. Unlike the\nstandard S4D convolution with its Cauchy Kernel approach, S4ConvD makes use of a convolutional\nkernel, to integrate adaptive state-space modeling and thus to dynamically adjust to changing\nenergy patterns, enhancing both accuracy and runtime.\nThe main contributions of this research are:\n(1) Adaptive State-Space Convolution: S4ConvD extends the S4D framework by introducing\na dynamically parameterized state matrix and an adaptive input transformation.\nJ.

Then we summarize the methods used by the three winning\nteams of the challenge as benchmarking results. As last point we introduce the related work on\ndeep SSMs. One of the key differences between the top-performing approaches and approaches\nwith worse performance was the used preprocessing methods to filter the data before modeling and\nthe corrections they applied after prediction and before submission e.g for removing anomalous\nbehavior from the dataset as well as various methods to apply weightings and the creation of\ncomplex ensembling frameworks [24].\nThe first-place implemented comprehensive data preprocessing to remove anomalies, impute\nmissing values, correct time zones and employed feature engineering to extract features, which\nincluded raw data, categorical interactions, temporal attributes, various weather features, and target\nencoding. An ensemble of CatBoost [8], LightGBM [28], and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) [14]\nwas used. The final predictions were obtained by combining individual model outputs using a\ngeneralized weighted mean approach [24].\nThe second-place approach involved manually removing outliers through visual inspection and\nfiltering of each building’s data. For feature selection, simple statistical and temporal features\nfrom weather and building metadata were computed, without relying on complex lag features. XG-\nBoost [6], LightGBM [28], CatBoost [8] and Feed-forward Neural Networks (FFNN) [41], specifically\nused for the electrical meter [47], were used as ensemble [24].\nThe third-place incorporated a log transformation on the target variable. The feature engineering\ninvolved weather-related features like heat, windchill, and lagged weather features, along with\ntemporal data and building metadata. Models including CatBoost [8], neural networks [38] and\nLightGBM [28] were trained. The final predictions were achieved by ensembling [7] these models\nusing a weighted average method, with weights derived from publicly available datasets [24].\nIn building energy prediction, issues of generalizability and scalability remain significant chal-\nlenges [31]. Traditional machine learning models often struggle to adapt across various building\ntypes and contexts. This necessitates exploring deep learning approaches, which offer the potential\nto capture intricate patterns and temporal behaviors. Additionally, integrating data-driven models\nwith physics-based approaches can provide a more holistic understanding of energy consumption\ndynamics [31]. Motivated by these challenges and opportunities, the development of S4ConvD\naims to bridge these gaps.\nWhile Transformer-based architectures have achieved remarkable success in sequence model-\ning [43], their quadratic complexity [26] limits scalability. Recent advancements in State Space\n1https://github.com/MilanShao/S4ConvD\nJ. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111. Publication date: August 2018.\n\n\n111:4\nSchaller et al.\nModels (SSMs) [16, 17, 19, 40, 44] provide an efficient alternative by utilizing structured state\ntransitions to capture temporal dynamics with lower computational overhead. SSMs originally\nderive from control theory [20]. In control engineering and system identification, state-space repre-\nsentation models a physical system through input, output, and state variables linked by first-order\ndifferential or difference equations. State variables evolve over time based on their current values\nand externally applied inputs. Output variables depend on the state variables, and potentially the\ninput variables [4, 21]. However, existing SSM approaches often rely on fixed parameterization,\nlimiting adaptability to rapidly changing data distributions. S4ConvD addresses this gap by intro-\nducing an adaptive state-space convolution, dynamically parameterized state matrices, enabling\nenhanced frequency sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that these refinements lead to superior\nperformance in energy consumption forecasting, particularly in urban-scale datasets such as the\nASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III dataset.\n3\nDataset\nFig. 2. Example of an anomaly in the dataset.\nDue to limitations in scalability observed in\nmany current approaches, which often cater\nto specific or limited datasets [31], the Great\nEnergy Predictor III dataset [24, 31, 32] is used.\nThis dataset is compiled from approximately\n61,910,200 energy measurements acquired from\ndiverse building types across 16 geographical\nlocations worldwide. ASHRAE also hosted the\nGreat Energy Predictor III (GEPIII) machine\nlearning competition on the Kaggle platform\n2019. This dataset captures hourly energy con-\nsumption metrics for 2,380 energy meters situ-\nated within 1,448 buildings. It contains various\ntypes of anomalies, such as abrupt changes in meter readings or outlier temperature values, which\ncould be due to sensor malfunctions, data entry errors, or unusual operational days. See, for instance,\nFig. 2, which depicts an example of such measurement anomalies where there is an unexpected\nspike in energy consumption not aligned with typical patterns and external conditions.\nThese hourly measurements come from different building types. The t-SNE (t-Distributed Sto-\nchastic Neighbor Embedding) distribution [45] in Fig. 3 visualizes high-dimensional building data\nby reducing its dimensionality to two dimensions while preserving the local structure of the data.\nEach point in the plot represents a building, and its color indicates its primary use category. The\nlegend provides a mapping between colors and categories, including lodging/residential, enter-\ntainment/public assembly, office, public services, education, parking, food sales and service, retail,\nwarehouse/storage, other, healthcare, utility, technology/science, manufacturing/industrial, and\nreligious worship. The distribution of points suggests that these building categories don’t form\ndense clusters. The lack of dense clustering for certain categories could suggest variations in\nbuilding design and operational efficiency which are not strictly bound by building type similarity.\nTo support analysis, coincident weather data was provided for each site. The dataset underwent\nminimal cleaning and processing to reflect real-world conditions accurately. It covers four different\ntypes of energy consumption: electricity, chilled water, steam, and hot water. The modeling process\ninvolved examining historical usage patterns alongside corresponding weather data.\nFig. 4 contains multiple time-series, each representing the mean meter readings of different\nbuildings over time. The x-axis in all plots corresponds to the time period from March 2016 to\nJ. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111.

Each plot is labeled with a specific\nbuilding_id, indicating the building for which the data is displayed.\nIn each graph, two different aggregations are shown: the blue lines represent the readings\nrecorded on an hourly basis, capturing short-term fluctuations, whereas the orange lines depict\ndaily averages, providing a smoothed representation of the overall trend. Most buildings exhibit\nan increasing trend in energy consumption over time, though the degree of variability differs.\nSome buildings, such as those with building_id: 60, display sudden spikes, suggesting anomalies or\npossible data recording issues. In contrast, buildings such as building_id: 76 show high fluctuations,\nbut with a clear increasing trend. The daily aggregation follows the overall shape of the hourly\ndata while reducing noise, making it easier to observe long-term trends.\nFig. 3. t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) plot of distributions along building types.\n3.1\nDatasplit\nThe dataset was segmented into three disjunct separate sets. The dataset is divided into a training\nset consisting of 11,637,272 rows, a validation set comprising 3,415,636 rows, and a test set con-\ntaining 5,108,845 rows. This should prevent from data leakage like it is caused in cross validation\nsettings [35].\n4\nEvaluation Metric\nTo evaluate the submissions in the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III competition [24, 31], the Root\nMean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) [23] was used as the primary metric. RMSLE was chosen\ndue to its capability to mitigate the disproportionate influence of meters with larger consumption\nvalues [15], thereby offering a balanced scoring approach compared to the conventional Root Mean\nSquare Error (RMSE) [5]. This choice was particularly relevant since significant variations in meter\nreadings could skew results if not addressed properly. Given the nonprofit nature of the competition,\nthe team opted for this established metric over a custom-designed one.\nJ. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111.

This formulation ensures that relative errors are emphasized, making prediction\nerrors for low values just as significant as those for high values. As a result, it provides a more\nbalanced evaluation, particularly in cases where the data spans multiple orders of magnitude.\n4.1\nInput Definition\nOur input data is derived from the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III dataset [24]. For each\nbuilding 𝑏𝑖with building index 𝑖, the input at each time step 𝑡𝑗at time 𝑗is defined by the feature\nvector:\nx(𝑖)\n𝑡𝑗=\nh\n𝐸(𝑖)\n𝑡𝑗,𝐶(𝑖)\n𝑡𝑗,𝑆(𝑖)\n𝑡𝑗, 𝐻(𝑖)\n𝑡𝑗,𝑇(𝑖)\n𝑎,𝑡𝑗,𝐶𝐶(𝑖)\n𝑡𝑗,𝑇(𝑖)\n𝑑,𝑡𝑗,𝜙(𝑡𝑗)\ni𝑇\n(2)\nIn this vector, 𝐸(𝑖)\n𝑡𝑗, 𝐶(𝑖)\n𝑡𝑗, 𝑆(𝑖)\n𝑡𝑗, and 𝐻(𝑖)\n𝑡𝑗\nrepresent the meter readings for electricity, chilled water,\nsteam, and hot water, respectively. Weather features include 𝑇(𝑖)\n𝑎,𝑡𝑗(air temperature), 𝐶𝐶(𝑖)\n𝑡𝑗(cloud\ncoverage), and 𝑇(𝑖)\n𝑑,𝑡𝑗(dew temperature). Additionally, 𝜙(𝑡𝑗) captures timestamp-derived features\nsuch as the hour of the day, day of the week, and holiday indicators.\nThe comprehensive feature vector x(𝑖)\n𝑡𝑗encapsulates all relevant data needed for our model to\ncapture both consumption patterns and influencing environmental factors.\nFig. 5. Heatmap of Input Correlations (same order on the x- and y-axis, thus x-axis not labeled due to\nrepetition).\nJ. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111. Publication date: August 2018.\n\n\n111:8\nSchaller et al.\nThe heatmap depicted in Fig. 5 provides a visual representation of the correlations among the\ninput features used for building energy consumption prediction in the ASHRAE Great Energy\nPredictor III dataset [24]. Through this heatmap [48], the strength and direction of linear rela-\ntionships between pairs of variables is discerned, indicated by correlation coefficients ranging\nfrom -1 to 1. A coefficient near 1 denotes a strong positive correlation, where an increase in one\nvariable is associated with an increase in another, whereas a coefficient near -1 suggests a strong\nnegative correlation, indicating an inverse relationship [18]. It uses a color gradient to represent the\ncorrelation coefficients between variables, where red indicates a strong positive correlation close to\n1.0, meaning that the two variables tend to increase or decrease together. Blue represents a negative\ncorrelation close to -1.0, meaning that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. White\nor light colors indicate little to no correlation close to 0.0, suggesting no strong linear relationship\nbetween the variables. The diagonal elements are all equal to 1.0, as they represent the correlation\nof each feature with itself. Some notable observations from the heatmap include that air tempera-\nture and east-west temperature show a strong positive correlation of 0.72, which is expected as\nthese two temperature-based features are closely related. Wind direction and wind speed have a\nmoderate positive correlation of 0.43, indicating some relationship between wind movement and\nspeed. Atmospheric pressure at sea level and air temperature show a negative correlation of -0.3,\nsuggesting that as air temperature increases, atmospheric pressure decreases. Other features such as\n𝑠𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑒𝑡and 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑏𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑡have weak correlations with most variables, meaning their relationships\nare less significant, just to explain some correlations.\n5\nS4ConvD Method\nOur proposed method builds upon the existing S4D framework [19] by introducing a novel method,\nS4ConvD, which reformulates the convolution operation within the state-space model to improve\nperformance and computational efficiency (for SSMs in general see next section). While conven-\ntional CNNs [34] or Transformers [43] struggle with long context windows [26], SSMs retain past\ninformation efficiently through their internal state update structures [4, 21]. S4D Conv combines\nthe S4D framework [19] with convolutional mechanisms [34] to handle long time-series data. The\nmatrix structure of SSMs is further utilized to enable parallel and spectral processing. In contrast\nto S4D, the kernel generation is facilitated by the SSM matrix structure [19] and subsequently\napplied as a convolution on the input time-series signal via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [9]. The\nparameters log𝐴and 𝐴𝑖𝑚determine the behavior of system dynamics and influence how quickly\nor slowly states are updated. By integrating with convolutions, the model focus is further directed\ntoward relevant frequency domains. While classical SSMs [4, 21] require recursive updates, which\ncan become numerically unstable and lead to vanishing or exploding gradients, S4 [17] introduced\nthe convolutional representation of SSMs for inference. In S4D the same Cauchy Kernel is used [19].\nFor the proposed S4ConvD, we instead use a convolutional kernel [34].\n5.1\nFoundation in S4D\nState Space Models (SSMs) provide a systematic and mathematical framework to model the dynamics\nof physical systems by capturing the intrinsic relationships between input, output, and internal\nstate variables. The block diagram representation of SSMs in Fig. 6 displays the interaction and\nflow of signals within the system’s structure. The primary components include input nodes u(𝑡),\nstate blocks x(𝑡), output nodes y(𝑡), transfer function elements represented by the matrices A, B,\nC, and D, as well as summation nodes, an integrator 1\n𝑠, and feedback loops.\nInput nodes represent the external inputs applied to the system, which are essential for driving\nthe system dynamics. These inputs influence the state variables, which are depicted in state blocks as\ncentral elements responsible for holding the current condition of the system, where x(0) represents\nJ.

The evolution of the state is determined by the contributions of Bu(𝑡)\nand Ax(𝑡), as indicated by the left summation node in the diagram. The result of this summation\nis then processed through the integration block 1\n𝑠, which represents the system’s memory and\naccumulates state changes over time.\nD\nB\nC\nA\n1/s\nu(t)\nx(t)\ny(t)\nx(0)\nx(t)\nFig. 6. Block diagram representation of SSMs.\nThe output is derived from the internal state\nthrough a transformation governed by Cx(𝑡), which\nis computed before reaching the right summation\nnode. This node also considers the direct contribu-\ntion of Du(𝑡), ensuring that both state-dependent\nand input-dependent components contribute to the\nfinal output y(𝑡).\nA key feature of the model is the feedback loop,\nwhich connects the state x(𝑡) back to the summation\nnode through the transformation by A. This feed-\nback mechanism highlights how the current state\ninfluences its own rate of change, a crucial aspect\nof capturing dynamic system behavior. By combining these elements, the block diagram pro-\nvides a clear visualization of how state-space equations operate within a system, emphasizing the\ncontinuous interaction between input, state, and output variables.\nState blocks are intricately linked to transfer functions, which mathematically define how system\ninputs transform into state changes over time (¤x(𝑡) = Ax(𝑡) + Bu(𝑡)). These transformations\ntypically involve linear operations such as multiplications by matrices, representing the system’s\ntime-invariant characteristics. Output nodes follow from the state blocks and are responsible for\nproducing the observable outputs of the system. The output values depend not only on the state\nvariables but may also be directly influenced by the inputs (y(𝑡) = Cx(𝑡) + Du(𝑡)). This dual\ndependency is integral to the logic of SSMs, where the output is a function of the current state and\nthe input, encapsulated by the output matrix. Feedback loops in the block diagram symbolize the\ncontrol actions that adjust the input based on the output, forming a closed-loop system [13, 29, 46].\nThe S4D model [19] is a state-space approach commonly represented by the following equa-\ntions [17, 19]:\nx(𝑖)\n𝑡𝑗+1 = Ax(𝑖)\n𝑡𝑗+ Bu(𝑖)\n𝑡𝑗,\n(3)\ny(𝑖)\n𝑡𝑗= Cx(𝑖)\n𝑡𝑗,\n(4)\nJ.

To improve computational efficiency, A is chosen to be diagonal, simplifying\nmatrix operations and accelerating inference [19].\n5.2\nNovelty of the S4ConvD Kernel\nIn the original S4 model, the computation of the convolution kernel posed significant computational\nchallenges, especially for general state matrices 𝐴. The S4 model introduced a complex algorithm\nfor Diagonal Plus Low Rank (DPLR) state matrices [17].\nFor diagonal state matrices 𝐴, however, the computation becomes numerical more stable [19].\nThe convolution kernel K is described by:\n𝐾ℓ=\n𝑁−1\n∑︁\n𝑛=0\n𝐶𝑛𝐴ℓ\n𝑛𝐵𝑛=⇒K = (B ⊙C) · VL(𝐴)\n(5)\nwhere ⊙denotes the Hadamard product, · represents matrix multiplication, and VL(𝐴) is the\nVandermonde matrix defined by:\nVL(𝐴)𝑛,ℓ= 𝐴ℓ\n𝑛\n(6)\nUnpacking this, K can be expressed using the Vandermonde matrix-vector multiplication:\nK =\n\u0002𝐵0𝐶0\n· · ·\n𝐵𝑁−1𝐶𝑁−1\n\u0003\n\n1\n𝐴0\n𝐴2\n0\n· · ·\n𝐴𝐿−1\n0\n1\n𝐴1\n𝐴2\n1\n· · ·\n𝐴𝐿−1\n1\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n1\n𝐴𝑁−1\n𝐴2\n𝑁−1\n· · ·\n𝐴𝐿−1\n𝑁−1\n\nThe approach involves materializing the Vandermonde matrix VL(𝐴) and performing matrix\nmultiplication, which requires O(𝑁𝐿) time and space.\nHowever, Vandermonde matrices are well-studied, and their multiplication can be theoretically\ncomputed in O(𝑁+ 𝐿) operations and O(𝑁+ 𝐿) space. Notably, Vandermonde matrices have close\nties with Cauchy matrices, forming the computational core of S4’s DPLR algorithm with similar\ncomplexity characteristics.\nFor our novel S4ConvD method, the convolution operation is formalized differently to better\nintegrate rapid variations in the building energy datasets. This is particularly achieved through the\nuse of adaptive scaling and frequency adjustment that aligns with dynamic input patterns.\nTo effectively capture rapid variations in building energy datasets, the convolution operation in\nthe S4ConvD method is structured to incorporate adaptive scaling and frequency adjustment. This\nallows the model to dynamically respond to changes in input patterns.\nThe convolution kernel in the S4ConvD framework is defined as:\nKS4ConvD(𝑡) = 𝐶× 𝜎(𝑒𝑡𝐴adaptive · 𝐵adaptive)\nHere, the components are detailed as follows: 𝐴adaptive: A dynamically parameterized state matrix\nthat adjusts during training to reflect real-time changes in the input data’s temporal dynamics.\n𝐵adaptive is an input matrix similarly parameterized to ensure that the model can incorporate\nvariations in the input data, adapting its influence on the state transformations. 𝜎(·) is a selective\nnon-linear transformation applied to the product 𝑒𝑡𝐴adaptive · 𝐵adaptive. This function enhances the\nkernel’s sensitivity to changes, differing from the constant linear scaling prevalent in traditional\nJ. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111.

We begin with an ablation study that explores\nthe impact of different kernel functions on the system’s runtime and accuracy. Following this, we\nevaluate the memory footprint of our approach, highlighting its resource efficiency compared to\nexisting methodologies. Furthermore, we conduct a robustness validation to assess the resilience\nand reliability of the proposed solution. Finally, we present benchmarking results that compare\nour method against state-of-the-art techniques on the same dataset. Through these experimental\nvalidations, we substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method in addressing contemporary\nchallenges in energy consumption prediction throughout different building types.\n6.1\nAblation study with different kernels\nIn our ablation study, we explored the performance impact of deploying different convolutional\nkernels within the sequence modeling framework for energy consumption prediction. Our primary\nfocus, the S4ConvD model, incorporates convolutional adjustments to improve sequence data\ninterpretation. We compared our approach against the original S4D approach, which utilizes a\nCauchy kernel renowned for its stability and capacity to smoothly model long-range dependencies.\nTo ensure a fair comparison all hyperparameters have been set on the same value like described in\nsection 5.2.\nTable 2.

This\nefficiency was consistently observed during both the training and inference phases. By integrating\nmemory tracking capabilities through Weights and Biases [25], we were able to monitor memory\nallocation and usage dynamically. The streamlined architecture of S4ConvD, which leverages\nFFT-based convolutions, contributes to this reduction by minimizing the storage demands typically\nJ. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111.

As can be observed from the figure, the process memory\navailable in MB is lower for S4ConvD, which means that the RAM usage is lower. The observed\npattern, where process memory usage increases at the start of each epoch and gradually decreases\ntowards the end, can be explained by the dynamic nature of memory allocation during model\ntraining. At the beginning of each epoch, the computational demands increase as the model loads\nnew batches of data and associated parameters into memory. This initialization phase requires\nsubstantial memory resources to accommodate the data structures involved in processing new\nbatches, gradient accumulation, and other temporary computations. As the epoch progresses,\nmemory optimization mechanisms such as memory recycling and garbage collection come into\nplay, freeing up resources by deallocating memory associated with completed computations and\nintermediate variables no longer in use. This resource management strategy leads to a gradual\ndecline in memory usage as the epoch advances.\n(a) Process Memory Available (MB) for S4D with\nCauchy Kernel and S4ConvD.

Time in minutes on the x-axis and\nDisk Utilization in GB on the y-axis.\nFig. 7. Comparison of Process Memory and Disk Utilization between S4D and S4ConvD.\nContinuing from the analysis of memory usage, our evaluation extends to the comparison of\ndisk utilization between the S4D and S4ConvD models as illustrated in Fig. 7 (b). The S4ConvD\nmodel demonstrates an improvement in disk utilization efficiency. This is largely attributable\nto its FFT-based convolutional strategy, which minimizes the frequency and volume of disk I/O\noperations. During both training and inference, the reduced disk access requirements of S4ConvD\nlessen the model’s dependency on persistent storage, thereby decreasing the disk utilization. Lower\ndisk utilization also indicates that S4ConvD processes data more efficiently in-memory, relying less\non disk storage for intermediary computational tasks. Consequently, this translates to a decrease in\nlatency that can arise from disk read/write operations, providing a smoother and faster execution\nflow. The observed temporary drop to zero in disk utilization at the 30-minute mark for the S4ConvD\nmodel can be attributed to its reliance on in-memory computations and the high-speed processing\ncapabilities inherently tied to Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). These architectures are designed\nto maximize memory utilization, thereby minimizing dependency on slower disk operations. By\nprioritizing in-memory computations, the model reduces latency and enhances processing efficiency,\nwhich may lead to temporary pauses in disk I/O operations during intensive data processing phases.\nAs a result, the system can manage data more effectively without frequent disk access, explaining\nthe brief drop during this period.\n6.3\nRobustness Validation\nIn order to ensure the robustness of the results and validate the consistency of our findings, we\nconducted repetitive experiments with both the S4D Cauchy Kernel and the S4ConvD approach.\nJ.

Publication date: August 2018.\n\n\nS4ConvD: Adaptive Scaling and Frequency Adjustment for Energy-Efficient Sensor Networks in Smart Buildings\n111:13\nEach model was trained and evaluated on subsets of the dataset, specifically using 1% and 5% of\nthe data. These experiments were repeated ten times for each kernel. The results demonstrated a\nremarkable consistency, as no significant deviations were observed in the performance metrics for\neither kernel across the repeated runs (e.g. the RMSLE remained 4.6676 for S4ConvD for all 10 runs\nwith 1% of the data, see Table 2). This demonstrates, that the observed performance is stable and\nnot an artifact of random sampling variability.\n6.4\nBenchmarking Results\nBased on the defined data split, we re-implemented the top three submissions and some of the\nbest other used models from the challenge on the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III competition\nleaderboard to serve as a benchmark against our proposed S4ConvD.\nTable 3.

This allows it to respond dynamically to variations in\ninput data, hence capturing real-time changes in energy consumption patterns more effectively than\nstatic methods. Although our method did not incorporate extensive data preprocessing techniques,\nsuch as robust feature engineering or anomalous data filtering, it nonetheless achieved superior\nperformance in comparison to the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III competition submissions.\nBy employing an adaptive convolution kernel that dynamically adjusts to rapidly changing input\nsequences, our approach inherently captures the essential patterns and dependencies within the\ndataset without requiring labor-intensive preprocessing steps. It also shows to be slightly better than\nthe original S4D approach with its Cauchy kernel. The Decision Tree model had an RMSLE of 0.607,\nwhich was better than the winning submissions in the challenge. The ensemble model combining\nLightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost, despite incorporating a variety of predictors performed notably\nlower than our S4ConvD, with an RMSLE of 1.232. LightGBM and other linear regression-based\napproaches like Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net exhibited limitations in inherently capturing nonlinear\ndependencies even with feature engineering. Their RMSLE scores, ranging from 1.292 to 1.473,\nreach middle scores. On the extreme, SVR’s high RMSLE of 2.298 indicates challenges in scalability\nand sensitivity to variations in the data set that the S4ConvD efficiently managed.\n7\nCUDA Optimization\nIn CUDA optimization, several key techniques are employed to enhance performance by improving\nmemory access patterns and computational efficiency [12].

Each block can have up to 1024 threads, aligning with potential block configurations\nfor efficiency. The maximum shared memory per block is 48 KB, which limits the tile configuration\nto not exceed this capacity. For a block using 8192 bytes of shared memory and 512 bytes for\nruntime overhead, the total is 8704 bytes per block, allowing up to 7 blocks in shared memory.\nWith 1024 threads per block and a max of 2048 threads per multiprocessor, two blocks can fit\nin shared memory. Each thread uses 37 registers, totaling 38848 registers per block. Given 65536\nregisters per multiprocessor, this is the limiting factor as only one block fits per shared memory. This\nresults in approximately 50% occupancy, with 32 out of 64 possible active warps per multiprocessor.\nConsequently, a tile size of 32 is set for Block Tiling on the NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU to optimize\nutilization.\nTable 5.

In Table 5 we show, that optimizing the\nkernel for higher arithmetic intensity (fewer memory operations, more computation) and ensuring\nefficient shared memory usage can maximize performance within these resource constraints about\n36 %.\n8\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we introduced S4ConvD, an convolutional variant of Deep State Space Models, to\naddress the challenges inherent in predicting energy consumption in smart buildings. By utilizing\nadaptive scaling and frequency adjustments, S4ConvD captures changing patterns in the multivari-\nate time-series data of the smart meter sensor network. Our evaluations on the ASHRAE Great\nEnergy Predictor III dataset demonstrate that S4ConvD surpasses existing benchmarks in predictive\naccuracy, showcasing its capability to generalize across diverse urban energy infrastructures.\nThe efficiency of S4ConvD is highlighted by its reduced memory and disk utilization, making it\nan option for deployment in resource-constrained real-world environments. These efficiencies are\nprimarily due to the use of FFT-based convolutions, which streamlined computational processes\nwithout sacrificing model performance in our task.\nFurthermore, the integration of CUDA optimization techniques, such as Global Memory Coalesc-\ning and Block Tiling, further amplifies the performance of S4ConvD. By leveraging the architectural\nstrengths of the NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU, we achieved a significant reduction of 35.38% in com-\nputational time per epoch, alongside maximal memory utilization at 99%. Its design principles\npromote resource-efficient model execution, enhancing both energy forecasting and the potential\nintegration of renewable energy sources into smart grid systems.\nBy minimizing reliance on extensive preprocessing and emphasizing dynamic adaptability,\nS4ConvD presents a scalable solution for energy-efficient sensor networks. In future work we will\nexplore the integration of S4ConvD into broader smart city frameworks, further validating its\nimpact on energy management systems. Our work also demonstrates significant synergies between\nmachine learning and energy modeling, particularly in enhancing prediction accuracy and response\ntimes in smart grids. In future research we will also focus on the integration of S4ConvD in real-time\nwith IoT platforms, enabling seamless data flow and analysis for instant decision-making in urban\ninfrastructures.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the grant number\n13GW0586F for funding research about state space models for time-series forecasting.\nReferences\n[1] Kadir Amasyali and Nora M El-Gohary. 2018.

{"text": "LITEASR: Efficient Automatic Speech Recognition with\nLow-Rank Approximation\nKeisuke Kamahori1,2\nJungo Kasai2\nNoriyuki Kojima2\nBaris Kasikci1\n1University of Washington 2Kotoba Technologies Inc.\n{kamahori,baris}@cs.washington.edu, {jkasai,nkojima}@kotoba.tech\nAbstract\nModern automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nmodels, such as OpenAI’s Whisper, rely on\ndeep encoder-decoder architectures, and their\nencoders are a critical bottleneck for efficient\ndeployment due to high computational inten-\nsity. We introduce LITEASR, a low-rank com-\npression scheme for ASR encoders that signifi-\ncantly reduces inference costs while maintain-\ning transcription accuracy. Our approach lever-\nages the strong low-rank properties observed in\nintermediate activations: by applying principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) with a small calibra-\ntion dataset, we approximate linear transforma-\ntions with a chain of low-rank matrix multipli-\ncations, and further optimize self-attention to\nwork in the reduced dimension. Evaluation re-\nsults show that our method can compress Whis-\nper large-v3’s encoder size by over 50%, match-\ning Whisper medium’s size with better tran-\nscription accuracy, thereby establishing a new\nPareto-optimal frontier of efficiency and perfor-\nmance. The code of LITEASR is available at\nhttps://github.com/efeslab/LiteASR.\n1\nIntroduction\nAutomatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have\nmade significant strides in recent years, achieving\nnear-human transcription performance (Radford\net al., 2023; Puvvada et al., 2024). Modern ASR\nmodels, such as OpenAI’s Whisper family, typi-\ncally adopt an encoder-decoder architecture (Rad-\nford et al., 2023). For instance, Whisper large-\nv3 comprises 32 Transformer blocks in both its\nencoder and decoder, totaling approximately 1.6\nbillion parameters, and has set new standards in\nmultilingual transcription accuracy.\nDespite these advances, deploying ASR systems\nin real-world applications poses substantial effi-\nciency challenges. First, many applications, such\nas live transcription, voice assistants, and real-\ntime translation, impose strict latency requirements\n(Macháˇcek et al., 2023; Bevilacqua et al., 2024;\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\n5.0\n5.5\n6.0\n6.5\nEncoder Size (\n)\n1e8\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\nWER (\n)\nLarge-v3\nTurbo\nMedium\nCompress with LiteASR\nModel\nLarge-v3\nTurbo\nMedium\nFigure 1: The relationship between encoder size and\naccuracy, as measured by word error rate (WER), for\nmodels in the Whisper family. The stars denote variants\ncompressed via our method, which achieves the Pareto-\noptimal balance between accuracy and efficiency.\nNguyen et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Jeffries\net al., 2024). Latency refers to the delay between\nthe input of audio and the output of the transcribed\ntext. In real-time applications, even a few seconds\nof delay can significantly degrade user experience.\nSecond, while the overall model size may be\nmoderate compared to the latest large language\nmodels (LLMs), ASR encoders are computation-\nally intensive due to the long input sequences they\nmust process. For instance, the encoder Transform-\ners in the Whisper series consistently process input\nsequences of length 1500. For real-time applica-\ntions, this encoder must be processed frequently,\nmaking it a significant computational bottleneck.\nThese challenges are acute in both on-device\nand data center settings. In on-device scenarios\n(e.g., laptops or smartphones), limited hardware\ncapabilities make it difficult to meet latency con-\nstraints. Even in data center environments, which\nserve multiple concurrent users, the high computa-\ntional intensity of ASR encoders becomes a critical\nbottleneck. Although batching can improve serv-\ning throughput for memory-bound workloads, such\nas ASR decoders, it provides limited benefits for\ncompute-bound encoders (as discussed in §2).\nMoreover, recent works have shown that the\n1\narXiv:2502.20583v1  [cs.LG]  27 Feb 2025\n\n\ndecoder component of ASR models can be ag-\ngressively compressed. For example, OpenAI’s\nWhisper large-v3-turbo successfully reduced the\nnumber of decoder layers from 32 down to 4 lay-\ners via distillation. Other variants, such as Distill-\nWhisper and Kotoba-Whisper, have taken this even\nfurther, compressing the decoder to as few as 2\nlayers (Gandhi et al., 2023; Kotoba Technologies,\n2024). However, the encoder part remains largely\nunexplored, making its optimization increasingly\ncrucial for efficient ASR systems.\nIn this work, we propose LITEASR, a novel\ncompression scheme that targets ASR encoders by\nexploiting the low-rank structure of hidden acti-\nvations during inference. A key insight driving\nour approach is that intermediate activations, both\nin self-attention and multi-layer perception (MLP)\nlayers, consistently exhibit low-rank properties\nacross a wide variety of inputs. This phenomenon\nstems from ASR encoders’ use of Mel spectro-\ngrams, the 2D time-frequency audio representa-\ntions. Real-world audio (e.g., human speech) ex-\nhibits strong correlations between frequency com-\nponents (Huang et al., 2012; Zergat and Amrouche,\n2013; Tian et al., 2024; Kacha et al., 2020), result-\ning in low-rank characteristics of the intermediate\nfeatures.\nOur method first analyzes the low-rank proper-\nties of activations using a small amount of calibra-\ntion data. We then perform a principal component\nanalysis (PCA) (Wold et al., 1987) to extract the\ndominant components and approximate linear trans-\nformations with rank-k projections. This factoriza-\ntion allows each weight matrix to be expressed as\nthe product of two lower-rank matrices, thereby\nreducing the total number of floating point opera-\ntions (FLOPs) required for inference. We employ\nan adaptive mechanism based on the threshold to\ndetermine the optimal degree of low-rank approxi-\nmation for each layer.\nTo further capitalize on the optimization, we also\nmodify the self-attention algorithm to operate in the\nreduced dimension. We implement a specialized\nGPU kernel based on FlashAttention (Dao et al.,\n2022) to accelerate the computation of attention\nscores and outputs.\nOur evaluation shows that LITEASR achieves\na Pareto-optimal balance between speed and ac-\ncuracy (see Figure 1). When applied to Whisper\nlarge-v3, LITEASR reduces the encoder size by ap-\nproximately 40%, yielding an execution speedup of\naround 1.4x with negligible accuracy loss. In alter-\nnative configurations, we further reduce the model\nsize to less than half, resulting in a model compa-\nrable in size to Whisper medium, while delivering\nimproved accuracy. We also demonstrate the appli-\ncability of the method across different languages\nand models (§4).\nIn summary, this paper makes the following con-\ntributions:\n1. We introduce LITEASR, a compression\nmethod for ASR encoders using a low-rank ap-\nproximation of activation values. This method\napproximates linear layers with a chain of low-\nrank matrix multiplications and optimizes self-\nattention to operate in a reduced dimension.\n2. We present a comprehensive evaluation\ndemonstrating that our method achieves a\nPareto-optimal balance between accuracy and\nefficiency.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: §2\ngives background on ASR efficiency, §3 presents\nour low-rank approximation framework, §4 details\nthe experimental setup, results, and analysis, §5\nreviews related work, and §6 concludes the paper.\n2\nBackground\n2.1\nAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR)\nASR models convert spoken language into text by\ntransforming raw audio into a compact representa-\ntion, such as a Mel spectrogram, and processing it\nwith neural networks. Modern systems often use\nencoder-decoder architectures, typically employ-\ning Transformers (Radford et al., 2023; Puvvada\net al., 2024; Rekesh et al., 2023; Gulati et al.,\n2020). For instance, OpenAI’s Whisper mainly\nuses Transformer blocks, each of which consists\nof self-attention and MLP layers with a large num-\nber of linear transformations (query/key/value/out\nprojections for self-attention and two larger lin-\near transformations for MLP). A notable recent\ntrend in ASR models is the reduction in decoder\nsize without compromising performance, as exem-\nplified by models such as Whisper large-v3-turbo\n(Radford et al., 2023) and Distill-Whisper (Gandhi\net al., 2023), which reduced the number of decoder\nlayers from 32 to 4 and 2, respectively.\n2.2\nCompute Requirements of ASR Models\nSince the encoder often processes long sequences\n(e.g., fixed at 1500 for Whisper), it often emerges\n2\n\n\n0\n50\n100\nM1 Pro\nRTX A6000\nRTX 4090\nLarge-v3, bs=1\n0\n50\n100\nTurbo, bs=1\n0\n50\n100\nLarge-v3, bs=8\n0\n50\n100\nTurbo, bs=8\nEncoder\nDecoder\nFigure 2: Latency breakdown of encoder and decoder\nrelative to end-to-end latency for Whisper large-v3 and\nWhisper large-v3-turbo models under varying batch\nsizes (1 and 8).\nas the primary runtime bottleneck. Figure 2 shows\nthe latency breakdown between the encoder and\ndecoder across three hardware setups (NVIDIA\nRTX 4090, NVIDIA RTX A6000, and Apple M1\nPro), two models (Whisper large-v3 and Whisper\nlarge-v3-turbo), and two batch sizes (1 and 8)1.\nAlthough the encoder only accounts for about\n15% of the overall latency for single-batch Whisper\nlarge-v3 on GPUs, it represents a more significant\nbottleneck in other scenarios. For the newer Whis-\nper large-v3-turbo model, the latency contribution\nof the encoder increases significantly due to the re-\nduced size of the decoder. Similarly, for on-device\ninference (e.g., M1 Pro), the encoder’s relative la-\ntency is higher due to the limited computational\npower of such devices compared to GPUs.\nIn data center deployment scenarios where mul-\ntiple requests are batched, the encoder’s latency\nimpact is further exacerbated. For example, with a\nbatch size of 8 and using Whisper large-v3-turbo,\nthe encoder can consume over 90% of the total la-\ntency. This disproportionate latency is primarily\ndue to the encoder’s high computational intensity\n(Williams et al., 2009); batching is therefore inef-\nfective at increasing throughput for encoders. In\ncontrast, the decoder generates tokens one at a time\nin an autoregressive manner and is memory-bound,\nbottlenecked by memory bandwidth rather than\ncomputational power, making batching an effective\nstrategy to enhance throughput (Chen, 2023). Con-\nsequently, although batching can substantially im-\nprove serving throughput for the decoder, it offers\nlimited benefits for the compute-bound encoder\nand the encoder becomes a notable bottleneck for\n1We use vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) (ver. 0.7.0) and MLX\n(Hannun et al., 2023) (ver. 0.21.1) to transcribe a sample audio\nclip from the ESB dataset (Gandhi et al., 2022).\nX\nY\n≈\n×\n×\nPCA\nY\nW\nX\nW\n×\n×\nY\n×\n=\nLow-Rank\nWeight\nOriginal\nWeight\nFigure 3: A simplified illustration of our proposal. We\nuse low-rank decomposition of activation values (Y) to\ncompress the weight (W).\nlarge batch sizes.\nThese findings collectively highlight the encoder\nas a critical bottleneck for efficient ASR deploy-\nment in both on-device and data center environ-\nments. This issue becomes more pronounced with\nrecent trends toward smaller decoders. Therefore,\nthere is a strong demand for methods to reduce the\ncomputational requirements of the encoder.\n3\nMethodology\nOur method, LITEASR, compresses the ASR en-\ncoder by extracting the low-rank features from ac-\ntivations at different layers of the model. To do so,\nwe first use calibration data to analyze activations\nand then convert the dense matrix multiplication\nwithin the model to the product of low-rank matri-\nces (Figure 3 shows a simplified overview of the\nmethod). We further modify the self-attention al-\ngorithm to work efficiently on reduced dimensions.\nIn this section, we explain the methodologies in\ndetail.\n3.1\nAnalyzing Activations in Transformers\nConsider a linear layer defined by\nY = XW + b,\n(1)\nwhere the weight matrix W ∈RDin×Dout and the\nbias vector b ∈RDout are learnable model param-\neters. Here, the input activations X ∈RL×Din\nproduce the output activations Y ∈RL×Dout dur-\ning the forward pass. In this notation, Din and Dout\ndenote the input and output dimensions of the layer,\nrespectively, and L is the sequence length2.\n2For Whisper encoders, this is always 1500.\n3\n\n\nTo study the distribution of activations, we col-\nlect calibration data consisting of Ncalib inputs. For\neach linear layer, we record the corresponding out-\nput Y . The resulting dataset can be viewed as\nL × Ncalib samples, where each sample is a Dout-\ndimensional vector. For simplicity, we refer to this\ncollection of samples as Y .\nOur goal is to approximate the observed activa-\ntions by projecting them onto their principal com-\nponents. First, let YM ∈RDout denote the mean\nvector of the dataset Y . Following the standard\nPCA procedure, we perform a singular value de-\ncomposition (SVD) on the mean-centered data:\nU, S, V = SVD(Y −YM).\n(2)\nHere, V ∈RDout×Dout is the matrix of right singular\nvectors. By selecting the first k columns of V ,\ndenoted by Vk ∈RDout×k, we capture the top-k\nprincipal components of the data. The original\nactivations can then be approximated as:\nY −YM ≈(Y −YM) Vk V ⊤\nk .\n(3)\nThis approximation retains the most significant fea-\ntures of Y while reducing its dimensionality.\n3.2\nCompressing Model Layers\nUsing the PCA approximation from Equation 3, we\ncan rewrite the original linear layer Y = XW + b\nas a combination of low-rank matrix multiplica-\ntions. Substituting Y = XW + b gives\nY −YM ≈(XW + b −YM) Vk V ⊤\nk\nY ≈(XW + b −YM) Vk V ⊤\nk + YM.\n(4)\nThis expression can be reorganized as\nY ≈X(WVk)V ⊤\nk +\n\u0010\nYM+(b−YM) Vk V ⊤\nk\n\u0011\n. (5)\nIn this factorization, the original layer is decom-\nposed into:\n• Two low-rank linear transformations, with\nweight matrices WVk ∈RDin×k and V ⊤\nk\n∈\nRk×Dout, and\n• A constant bias term given by YM + (b −\nYM) Vk V ⊤\nk .\nSince both weight matrices and bias can be pre-\ncomputed using calibration data, this decomposi-\ntion significantly reduces FLOPs when k is much\nsmaller than the original dimension.\n3.2.1\nHow to Choose k\nChoosing the appropriate value for k involves\na trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. A\nsmaller k leads to a more aggressive approxima-\ntion, which increases efficiency but may incur a\nlarger accuracy loss.\nAccuracy Constraint.\nTo preserve accuracy, the\ntop-k principal components must capture a suf-\nficient portion of total variance. Let S ∈RDout\ndenote the singular values from the SVD of the\nmean-centered activations (assumed to be sorted in\ndecreasing order). We enforce\nk\nX\ni=1\nS2\ni > θ\nDout\nX\ni=1\nS2\ni ,\n(6)\nwhere θ is a threshold that controls the trade-off\nbetween accuracy and efficiency (i.e., the extent of\ndata compression).\nEfficiency Constraint.\nThe original linear layer\nrequires O(LDinDout) FLOPs for its matrix mul-\ntiplication. In contrast, the decomposed form in\nEquation 4 requires O(LDink + LkDout) FLOPs.\nTo ensure that our approximation results in a reduc-\ntion of computation, we require\nLDink + LkDout < LDinDout,\n(7)\nwhich simplifies to\nk(Din + Dout) < DinDout.\n(8)\nFor example, in Whisper large-v3, the dimen-\nsions for self-attention layers are (Din, Dout) =\n(1280, 1280),\nand for MLP layers they are\n(1280, 5120) or (5120, 1280). This implies that\nthe efficiency constraint requires k < 640 for self-\nattention and k < 1024 for MLP layers.\nPractical Considerations.\nTo maximize the\nGPU efficiency, we further restrict k to be a multi-\nple of 16. Therefore, we choose k as the smallest\nmultiple of 16 that satisfies both of Equation 6\nand Equation 7. We empirically find that θ values\nbetween 0.99 and 0.999 achieve a good balance\nbetween accuracy and efficiency. A detailed sensi-\ntivity study on the choice of θ is provided in §4.\n3.2.2\nOptimizing Self-Attention\nMoreover, there is a potential to optimize the self-\nattention layers further. Specifically, if the rank k is\nsmaller than the per-head dimension, we can com-\npute the attention score and the value projection in\nalternative ways to reduce the FLOPs requirement\nwhile preserving the mathematical operations.\n4\n\n\nStandard Self-Attention.\nFor multi-head atten-\ntion, let Dhead denote the dimension per head and\nh the number of heads (i.e., the total model dimen-\nsion is Dhead × h). In the i-th head, given an input\nactivation matrix X ∈RL×Din, the self-attention\nmechanism first computes three linear projections:\nQi = XW i\nQ,\nKi = XW i\nK,\nVi = XW i\nV ,\n(9)\nwhere W i\nQ, W i\nK, W i\nV ∈RDin×Dhead are the corre-\nsponding weight matrices. The standard attention\noutput is then given by\nAttention(Qi, Ki, Vi) = softmax\n\u0012 QiK⊤\ni\n√Dhead\n\u0013\nVi,\n(10)\nwith the softmax applied row-wise.\nAttention Score Computation. Using our low-\nrank approximation, we can factorize each projec-\ntion as follows:\nQi = (XWQ1)W i\nQ2 + bi\nQ,\nKi = (XWK1)W i\nK2 + bi\nK,\nVi = (XWV1)W i\nV2 + bi\nV ,\n(11)\nwhere WQ1 ∈RDin×kQ, W i\nQ2 ∈RkQ×Dhead, and\nbi\nQ ∈RDhead are parameters relevant for i-th head\nafter low-rank approximation (with analogous defi-\nnitions for K and V ). Here, kQ, kK, and kV are the\nrespective rank sizes. For brevity, let A = XWQ1\nand B = XWK1. Expanding the product QiK⊤\ni ,\nwe obtain:\nQiK⊤\ni =\n\u0010\nAW i\nQ2 + bi\nQ\n\u0011\u0010\nBW i\nK2 + bi\nK\n\u0011⊤\n=\n\u0010\nAW i\nQ2 + bi\nQ\n\u0011\u0010\nW i ⊤\nK2 B⊤+ bi ⊤\nK\n\u0011\n= AW i\nQ2W i ⊤\nK2 B⊤\n+ AW i\nQ2bi ⊤\nK + bi\nQW i ⊤\nK2 B⊤+ bi\nQbi ⊤\nK .\n(12)\nIn this expansion, the term AW i\nQ2W i ⊤\nK2 B⊤domi-\nnates the computational cost, while the other three\nterms are bias contributions.\nThe standard approach (Equation 10) computes\nQi and K⊤\ni separately and then multiplies them,\nwhich requires approximately O(L2Dhead) FLOPs.\nIn contrast, Equation 12 allows us to first compute\nthe smaller matrix product W i\nQ2W i ⊤\nK2 and then mul-\ntiply by A and B, reducing the computational cost\nto O(L kQ kK + L2 min(kQ, kK)). This is benefi-\ncial when min(kQ, kK) < Dhead3. Thus, we adopt\nEquation 12 if the rank is sufficiently small.\n3We take the minimum of kQ and kK because we can\nchoose the multiplication order to minimize computation.\nValue projection. After computing the attention\nscore matrix\nSi = softmax\n\u0012 QiK⊤\ni\n√Dhead\n\u0013\n∈RL×L,\n(13)\nthe final output is obtained by multiplying Si with\nVi:\nSiVi = Si\n\u0010\n(XWV1)W i\nV2 + bi\nV\n\u0011\n= Si(XWV1)W i\nV2 + Sibi\nV .\n(14)\nConventionally,\none\nwould\nfirst\ncompute\n(XWV1)W i\nV2 and then multiply by Si, which\nwould cost O(L2Dhead + L kV Dhead) FLOPs.\nHowever, by computing Si(XWV1) first, the cost\nbecomes O(L2kV + L kV Dhead) FLOPs, making\nthis approach more efficient when kV < Dhead.\nMoreover, since each row of Si sums to 1, the\nbias term simplifies4:\nSibi\nV = bi\nV .\n(15)\nThus, the value projection can be rewritten as:\nSiVi =\n\u0010\nSi(XWV1)\n\u0011\nW i\nV2 + bi\nV ,\n(16)\nwhich is more efficient if kV < Dhead.\nImplementation. To efficiently execute the oper-\nations in Equations 12 and 16, we implement a\nspecialized kernel using Triton (Tillet et al., 2019).\nThis kernel extends the original FlashAttention im-\nplementation (Dao et al., 2022) to handle our opti-\nmized computation strategy.\n4\nExperiments\nIn this section, we describe our experimental setup\nand results, focusing on both the accuracy and effi-\nciency of LITEASR.\n4.1\nSetup\nOur primary accuracy evaluation focuses on com-\npressing Whisper large-v3 and Whisper large-v3-\nturbo, both of which have encoders of the same\nsize.

For\nthe calibration data, we randomly select 100 clips\n(non-overlapping with the test data), and the cal-\nibration process is completed within 10 minutes\nusing a single RTX 4090 GPU. We employ greedy\nsampling with a temperature set to 0.\nWe present three configurations of θ for different\ndeployment requirements: (a) Quality-Focused:\nθ = 0.999 for all layers. (b) Balanced: θ = 0.99\nfor self-attention layers and θ = 0.999 for MLP\nlayers. (c) Efficiency-Focused: θ = 0.99 for self-\nattention layers and θ = 0.995 for MLP layers.\nLater, we conduct a sensitivity study for different\nvalues of θ, languages, and models.\nRegarding efficiency, we evaluated the encoder\nlatency on NVIDIA RTX 4090, NVIDIA RTX\nA6000, and Apple M1 Pro. For GPUs, we mod-\nify OpenAI’s Whisper implementation5 to use\nCUDA Graph with PyTorch (Ansel et al., 2024)\n(ver. 2.5.1), and we use Triton (Tillet et al., 2019)\n(ver. 3.2.0) for a customized self-attention GPU\nkernel.

The data is presented\nfor configuration (c). In general, the initial lay-\ners allow for more substantial compression, with\nsome exceptions, such as the FC2 stage in layer 21.\nThis tendency is most pronounced in FC2 layers,\nwhere the earlier layers exhibit a compression ra-\ntio of less than 0.2, whereas the subsequent layers\nreach values larger than 0.8. Among the layers, the\nQ/K projection and FC1 layers display a smaller\ncompression ratio compared to other layers.\n4.4.2\nSensitivity to θ\nFigure 7 analyzes the sensitivity of the average\nWER and encoder size to θ by independently vary-\ning θ from 0.95 to 0.999 for self-attention and MLP\nlayers in Whisper large-v3. Our results show a sig-\nnificant increase in WER when θ is below 0.99\nfor both layers. In contrast, WER improves as θ\nincreases, with θ = 0.999 achieving the best per-\nformance. The encoder size exhibits the opposite\ntrend, positively correlated with θ in a steady and\nroughly linear fashion. In the extreme scenario\nwhere θ = 0.95 is applied to both layers, the en-\ncoder size can be reduced by around 80%, although\nthis comes with a significant increase in WER.\n4.4.3\nSensitivity to Languages\nTo further investigate how LITEASR generalizes\nto out-of-distribution data and its sensitivity to lan-\nguages, we extend our evaluation to non-English\nbenchmarks.

Table 3 presents the encoder size and the\naverage WER for ESB datasets. The data indicates\nthat there is minimal degradation in the WER, al-\nthough the reduction in size is moderate compared\nto the Whisper models, achieving approximately a\n10% reduction for configuration (c).\n5\nRelated Work\n5.1\nEfficient ASR Inference\nSeveral prior works have aimed to enhance ASR\nmodel efficiency. FasterWhisper uses optimized\nboundaries.\ninference kernels (SYSTRAN, 2023), while Whis-\nperX further improves it for long-form audio (Bain\net al., 2023).\nWhisper.cpp is a C/C++ imple-\nmentation for portability on both the CPU and\nGPU (Gerganov, 2023). Whisper_streaming sup-\nports live transcription for streaming purposes\n(Macháˇcek et al., 2023). NVIDIA’s NeMo is a mod-\nular toolkit for deploying speech models (Harper\net al.). However, they do not effectively reduce\nASR encoder computational demands. Some works\nprovide model weight quantization, but they are\nlimited to weights (weight-only quantization) and\ndo not accelerate the compute-bound encoder in-\nference. Our approach can be integrated with these\nframeworks.\nVarious studies, including Whisper large-v3-\nturbo, Distill-Whisper, and Kotoba-Whisper use\ndistillation techniques to shrink decoder size (Rad-\nford et al., 2023; Gandhi et al., 2023; Kotoba Tech-\nnologies, 2024). Other approaches combine dis-\ntillation with quantization or lightweight modular\nASR fine-tuning for underrepresented languages\n(Shao et al., 2023; Ferraz et al., 2023). Our work\ncomplements these efforts by further reducing the\nencoder’s computational requirements.\n5.2\nModel Compression with Low-Rank\nApproximation\nThe low-rank approximation has been used to\ncompress machine learning models, such as for\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (Hu et al., 2021)\nor the LLM’s KV cache compression (Liu et al.,\n2024; Chang et al., 2024). Yu and Wu (2023) has\nsuggested that activations in Transformer models\nexhibit low-rank and compressed models, mainly\ntargeting vision models. However, their method is\nlimited to linear layers, leaving self-attention layers\nunoptimized, and its applicability to speech models\nhas not been studied.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this work, we introduced a compression method\nfor ASR encoders that leverages the inherent low-\nrank structure of activations in linear layers. By\napplying the PCA algorithm, this method approxi-\nmates linear layers with a chain of low-rank matrix\nmultiplications and optimizes self-attention to op-\nerate in a reduced dimension. Our comprehensive\nevaluation demonstrates that our method achieves\na Pareto-optimal balance between accuracy and ef-\nficiency, paving the way for more efficient ASR\n8\n\n\ndeployments for both on-device and data center\nenvironments.\n7\nLimitations\nOur method focuses on compressing linear layers\nand self-attention mechanism, yielding substantial\nimprovements for Whisper models. However, other\narchitectures, such as the Conformer, include ad-\nditional components such as convolution layers,\nwhich may provide further compression opportu-\nnities (see §4).\nAdditionally, our evaluation is\ncurrently limited to standard benchmarks in En-\nglish and a few other major languages; evaluat-\ning performance on low-resource languages and\ndomain-specific applications remains an important\ndirection for future research. Finally, while our im-\nprovements do not introduce new risks per se, the\nenhanced efficiency could accelerate the broader\nadoption of ASR systems, which may amplify con-\ncerns related to privacy, surveillance, or inherent\nbiases in large-scale deployments.\n8\nEthics Statement\nAll data and models used in this paper are pub-\nlicly accessible and are distributed under Creative\nCommons, Apache-2.0, MIT, or other open-source\nlicenses that permit research use.\nReferences\nJason Ansel, Edward Yang, Horace He, Natalia\nGimelshein, Animesh Jain, Michael Voznesensky,\nBin Bao, Peter Bell, David Berard, Evgeni Burovski,\net al. 2024.\nPytorch 2: Faster machine learning\nthrough dynamic python bytecode transformation and\ngraph compilation.

Recent advancements in \nsingle-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) cameras have unlocked exceptional capabilities in \nsensitivity, time resolution, and high frame-rate imaging. Despite this, the application of large-\nformat SPAD arrays in speckle contrast analysis is still relatively uncommon. In this study, we \nintroduce a pioneering use of a large-format SPAD camera for DSCA. By harnessing the \ncamera’s high temporal resolution and photon-detection efficiency, we significantly enhance \nthe accuracy and robustness of speckle contrast measurements. Our experimental results \ndemonstrate the system's remarkable ability to capture rapid temporal variations over a broad \nfield of view, enabling detailed spatiotemporal analysis. Through simulations, phantom \nexperiments, and in vivo studies, we validate the approach’s potential for a wide range of \nbiomedical applications, such as cuff occlusion tests and functional tissue monitoring. This \nwork highlights the transformative impact of large SPAD cameras on DSCA, setting the stage \nfor new breakthroughs in optical imaging. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nI. INTRODUCTION \nIn a healthy individual, proper blood flow (BF) is vital for maintaining a steady supply \noxygen and essential energy sources, such as glucose and lactate, to organs, while also ensuring \nthe  efficient removal of metabolic waste products 1. Of particular importance is cerebral blood \nflow (CBF), which is crucial for optimal brain function 2, brain metabolism 3, and the brain's \nability to respond to external stimuli 4. For adults, typical CBF is around 50 ml/(100 g min) 5, \nwhereas in newborns, it ranges between 10-30 ml/(100 g min) 6. Any disruption to CBF can \nresult in significant brain damage, including ischemic injury or stroke 7. Real-time monitoring \nof blood flow is essential for diagnosing and managing a variety of medical conditions, such \nas stroke, traumatic or hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) 8, neurological disorders, \ncardio-cerebral diseases, cancer treatments, tissue perfusion in peripheral vascular diseases 9, \nbrain health and function 10, wound healing, sepsis, shock 11, skeletal muscle injuries 12, and \ntissue viability during surgical procedures. \nSeveral optical methods have been employed for non-invasive monitoring of both \nhealthy and pathophysiological tissues, including laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) 13, \nlaser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS), and Diffuse speckle \ncontrast analysis (DSCA) – also referred to as speckle visibility spectroscopy (SVS) or speckle \ncontrast optical spectroscopy (SCOS). A key distinction between these techniques lies in their \npenetration depth: while LSCI and LDF are typically limited to superficial tissues (less than 1 \nmm) due to their reliance on single or few dynamic scattering events, DSCA/SCOS and DCS \ncan penetrate much deeper, reaching several centimeters into tissue. \nDCS relies on temporal sampling methods, where traditional avalanche photodiodes \n(APDs) or advanced single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detectors capture intensity \nfluctuations from one or a few speckle grains to reconstruct temporal dynamics. In contrast, \nDSCA uses a spatial sampling approach, which doesn't require a detector with a high frame \nrate. Instead, the camera typically operates with an exposure time longer than the speckle field’s \ndecorrelation time, utilizing a larger detection area with many pixels to capture more photons \nand speckles. Originally, Bi et al. first proposed DSCA 14–16, drew heavily from the concepts \nof LSCI, focusing on average values rather than imaging blood flow. DSCA is sometimes \nreferred to as SVS 17 or SCOS 18, and it has been extensively studied theoretically 19,20 and \nexperimentally 21,22. Notably, Kim et al. (2023) demonstrated that DSCA/SCOS outperforms \nDCS, offering more than a 10-fold improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at a comparable \ncost. Importantly, while the setup for a fiber-based DSCA system is identical to that of DCS, \nDSCA does not require model-based fitting to separate absorption and scattering effects from \nthe dynamic signal, and thus it does not provide a quantitative estimate of blood flow 18. \nConventionally, DSCA combines the deep tissue penetration capabilities of DCS with the \nrelatively low-cost CCD or CMOS detectors used in LSCI. However, despite the use of these \naffordable detectors, DSCA has not yet seen widespread commercial adoption. With the \nintroduction of faster photon-counting detectors, such as SPAD cameras, which have negligible \nreadout noise, it is now possible to apply the spatial DSCA technique with improved statistical \nreliability in speckle contrast calculations. \n\n\nIn this study, we introduce a novel, compact 512 × 512 pixel SPAD array called ATLAS \n23,24 built with industry-standard CMOS technology, for deep tissue blood flow (BF) \nmeasurements using the DSCA approach. This detector array boasts high photon efficiency, \nminimal dead time, zero readout noise, and a high frame rate (up to 27kfps), all of which are \nessential for precise BF measurements in low-light, in vivo conditions. Future advancements \ncould enable real-time BF monitoring in freely moving subjects. To evaluate our ATLAS-\nDSCA system, we conducted deep tissue BF measurements in four healthy volunteers during \narterial arm cuff occlusion and forehead BF monitoring. Additionally, vibration phantom \nexperiments were performed, and the results were compared to those from a traditional DSCA \nsystem. \nA summary of existing DSCA/SCOS systems is provided in Table I, detailing laser \nwavelength, applications, sampling rate, source-detector separation, and sensor type. This table \nhighlights the evolution of DSCA technology and contextualizes the significance of our \nproposed system in advancing the field. \nThe structure of this paper is as follows: we first present the theoretical principles of \nDSCA, followed by a description of the SPAD camera architecture and system implementation. \nNext, we compare our phantom results with those from traditional DSCA methods. Finally, we \npresent the in vivo experimental results, discuss the advantages and limitations of the SPAD-\nDSCA system, and propose potential future improvements.  \nTable I Existing DSCA/SCOS system \nLaser \nWavelength \n(nm) \nApplications \nSampling \nrate (Hz) \nFiber-\nbased/fiberless \nSource-\ndetector \nseparation \n(mm) \nSystem \nname \nYear \nSensor \nRef. \nCW \n785 \nForearm \n30 \nFiber-based \n24 \nDSCA \n2013 \nEMCCD \n14 \nCW \n785 \nForearm and \npalm \n1 \nFiber-based \n15 \ntDSCA \n2013 \nCCD \n15 \nCW \n785 \nForearm \nN.A. \nFiberless \n30 \nSCOS \n2014 \nCCD \n18 \nCW \n671 \nPhantom \nN.A. \nFiberless \n18 \nDSCA \n2017 \nCCD \n25 \nCW \n785 \nForearm & \nforehead \nN.A. \nFibreless \n20 \nSCOS \n2018 \nSPAD \n(32×2) \n26 \nCW \n785 \nForearm, & \nforehead  \n300 \nFiber-based \n25 \nDSCA \n2020 \nCCD \n16 \nCW \n785 \nForehead \nN.A. \nFiber-based \n26 \nSCOS \n2023 \nsCMOS \n27 \nVHG \nholographic \n852 \nForearm, \nforehead & \narithmetic \ntests \nN.A. \nFiber-based \n45 \nSCOS \n2023 \nsCMOS \n28 \nCW \n785 \nForehead \n80 \nCompact and \nfiberless \n50 \nSCOS \n2024 \nSony \nIMX392 \n29 \nCW \n785 \nDiabetic \n330 \nFiber-based \n12 \nDSCA \n2024 \nCCD \n30 \nCW \n785 \nForearm \nN.A. \nFiber-based \n25 \nDSCA \n2024 \nGeneric \nphotodiode \n31 \nCW \n808 \nWrist, \nexercise \n390 \nFiber-based \n4.5 \nSCOS \n2024 \nBasler \nboost \n32 \nCW \n785 \nForearm, \nforehead & \narithmetic \ntests \n> 800 \nFiber-based \n30 \nDSCA \n2025 \nSPAD \n(512×512) \nours \n \n \n \n\n\nII. METHODS  \nA. Theoretical Background \nDSCA relies on the speckle contrast (𝜅), defined as the ratio of the standard deviation \n(𝜎𝐼(𝜌, 𝑇)) of the measured intensity during a specific exposure time to its mean (〈𝐼〉) across \nvarious speckles. DSCA quantifies the statistics of the fluctuation of the speckle pattern as the \nvariance of the measured intensity (𝜎𝐼\n2) either in spatial or temporal domains 33: \n                                                 𝜅2(𝜌, 𝑇) =\n𝜎𝐼\n2(𝜌,𝑇)\n〈𝐼(𝜌,𝑇)〉2                                                                 (1)        \nhere 𝜌 denotes the source-detector separation, T is the exposure time, and 𝜅2 varies between \nzero and one, with a higher value indicating a slower scatterer fluctuation. 𝜅 is related to the \nnormalized electric field auto-correlation function (𝑔1(𝑟, 𝑇)) is given by: \n                             𝜅2(𝜌, 𝑇) =\n2𝛽\n𝑇∫(1 −\n𝜏\n𝑇)|𝑔1(𝜌, 𝜏)|2𝑑𝜏\n𝑇\n0\n.                                                     (2) \nwhere 𝑔1(𝜌, 𝜏) = 𝐺1(𝜌, 𝜏) 𝐺1(𝜌, 0)\n⁄\n and 𝐺1(𝜌, 𝜏) represents the Green’s function of Brownian \nmotion at 𝜌 in a semi-infinite geometry 34. In this equation, 𝛽 is an experimental constant that \naccounts for the collection optics.  \nB. Noise Correction  \nIn practical applications, it is crucial to adjust the speckle contrast calculation to account \nfor shot noise and other noise sources inherent in the detection system. Since speckle contrast \n(κ) is influenced by the variance from the expected theoretical behavior, deviations become \nparticularly pronounced in regions with lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is important to \nnote that the calculation in Eq. (1) does not account for these additional noise contributions, \nespecially in areas with lower SNR. To address this, we define a corrected squared speckle \ncontrast 𝜅𝑐\n2 as follows: \n                                      𝜅𝑐\n2 = 𝜅𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑\n2\n−𝜅𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑡\n2\n−𝜅𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑘\n2\n                                                      (3)          \nBefore calculating 𝜅, the raw intensity images are corrected by subtracting dark counts and \nremoving bad pixels. The dark offset, determined as the average of 1000 dark images (with the \nlaser off), is subtracted from the raw intensity to obtain the corrected intensity 𝐼𝑐= 𝐼−𝐼𝐷. \nEven though the intensity is corrected, the variance from the dark noise is included in the \nintensity’s variance, making it essential to deduct the dark variance 𝜎𝐷\n2. Another significant \nnoise source is inherent shot noise, which follows Poisson statistics, with a variance equal to \nthe mean intensity in electrons [e-], defined as 𝜎𝑠\n2 = 〈𝐼𝑐〉. Since SPAD cameras have no readout \nnoise, Eq. (3) becomes: \n                                                    𝜅𝑐\n2 =\n𝜎𝐼𝑐\n2 −𝜎𝐷\n2−𝜎𝑠2\n〈𝐼𝑐〉2\n.                                                                     (4) \nThe blood flow index (BFi) is then related to 𝜅𝑐\n2 by: \n                                                       𝐵𝐹𝑖=\n1\n𝜅𝑐2                                                                            (5) \n\n\nIn all the findings presented in this paper, we use the normalized blood flow index (normalized \nBFi) to provide standardized BF data, enhancing comparability across measurements. The BFi \nmetric reflects the total blood volume transported within a specific time frame. According to \nPoiseuille's law 35, BF is strongly influenced by factors such as blood pressure, vessel radius, \nviscosity, and vessel length. Even small changes in vessel radius can have a significant impact \non BF due to its fourth-power relationship with radius. \nC. SPAD (ATLAS) Architecture  \nThe sensor, called ATLAS hereafter, features a 512 × 512 array of deep trench isolation \n(DTI) microlensed SPADs with a 10.17 µm pitch. It offers a peak photon detection efficiency \n(PDE) of 55% (26% at 940 nm) and a median dark count rate (DCR) of 500 cps at room \ntemperature, operating at 23 V with a breakdown voltage of 17.8 V 36. The passively quenched \nSPADs are organized into 4×4 groups using an OR-tree structure to form 128 × 128 \nmacropixels, each with a 40.68 µm pitch. Each macropixel is capable of computing a 31-tap \nautocorrelation function with a minimum correlation time of 1 µs (which can be reduced to 100 \nns, depending on the clock rate). \nATLAS supports the following operating modes: \n1. A 22-bit single-photon counting mode. \n2. A time-gated 22-bit single-photon counting mode via a balanced H-tree, with time gates \ngenerated by an FPGA or on-chip DLL at 15–30 ps granularity. \n3. A multispeckle DCS mode, delivering the average of individual pixel autocorrelations \nin an on-chip, high-speed “ensemble” mode 23,24. \n4. A DCS imaging mode 23,24. \nIn ATLAS, each photon is directly converted into a 1-bit count, eliminating the readout \nnoise typically encountered in CCD or CMOS imagers. The clock frequency is adjustable (e.g., \n20 MHz, 25 MHz, 50 MHz, 75 MHz), and TBIN_CLK_PERIODS can range from 32 to \n65,535. The chip is mounted on a PCB board and connected to a field-programmable gate array \n(FPGA), such as the Opal Kelly 7310-A200. \nIn the photon counting (PC) mode, as shown in FIG. 1(a), each pixel acquires photons \nduring a single exposure (TBIN period) and photons are counted with a 5-bit ripple counter. At \nthe end of the TBIN exposure, the shift register is clocked, transferring the 5-bit count into the \nfirst element (C(τ₀)) and subsequently accumulated to the first SRAM address. This is repeated \nfor a user defined number of integration cycles (i.e., TINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS). After which \nthe accumulated 22-bit count is read out via the column bus. It is worth noting that in the PC \nmode only the first elements of the Shift Register and SRAM are utilised, and the Multiplier is \n\n\nconfigured to multiply C(τ₀) with 1 (effectively by-passing the Multiplier). The remaining 31 \nshift register and SRAM elements are utilised in other DCS related modes. FIG. 1(b) shows \nthe Global shutter timing diagram for photon counting mode. \n \nFIG. 1. (a) Block diagram showing main blocks of the pixel schematic operating in Photon Counting mode. (b) \nGlobal shutter timing diagram for photon counting mode. Integration time: Tint, Row readout time: Trr.  \nD. Implementation（Experimental Setup） \nThe experimental setup is schematically illustrated in FIG. 2(a). A long-coherence 785-\nnm laser (>5 m coherence length, DL785-100-S from CrystaLaser) serves as the light source. \nLaser light is delivered to the phantom through a multimode (MM) fiber with a 200 µm core, \nwhile scattered light is collected by another MM fiber with the same core size. One end of the \ndetection fiber is placed on the phantom’s surface, with the other end aligned to the center of \nthe SPAD camera. Zoomed-in images of the SPAD chip (front view) and the Opal Kelly FPGA \nboard (back view) are also provided.  \nFIG. 2(b) displays simulation results of scattered light propagation through a “banana-\nshaped” region in tissue, simulated using MCmatlab [19] based on the MCXYZ model \ndeveloped by Jacques and Li [20]. The simulation settings are detailed in Ref. [21]. Considering \nthe SNR and flow sensitivity for speckle imaging in biomedical applications, typical exposure \ntimes range from 1 to 10 ms 37. In our experiments, we used an exposure time of 1.64 ms \n(TINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS = 1024) with 𝜌 = 15 mm, resulting in an image acquisition rate \nof 361.7 fps.  \n\n\n \nFIG. 2.

These simulations were conducted using MCmatlab 38 based on the model MCXYZ \ndeveloped by Jacques and Li 39. Detailed simulation settings can be found in Ref. 40. \nE. Data Processing \nThe data processing pipeline is shown in FIG. 3. Raw speckle data, also known as \nintensity imaging data under PC mode, is initially acquired as a three-dimensional matrix. The \nfirst step involves identifying and removing bad pixels, which are detected based on irregular \nsignal characteristics or abnormally high noise levels. Next, 𝜅 is extracted to isolate the signal \nfrom noise. Shot noise reduction is then applied to minimize high-frequency fluctuations \narising from the stochastic nature of photon detection, significantly enhancing the SNR. Finally, \nfiltering is performed to smooth the signal and preserve essential features for further analysis. \nThis processing pipeline ensures that the data is reliable and of high quality for subsequent \ninterpretation and modeling.  \nThe data processing pipeline for speckle contrast analysis follows a structured approach \nto ensure high-quality and reliable data extraction, as illustrated in FIG. 3. The process begins \nwith the collection of raw speckle data, a three-dimensional matrix that records intensity \nfluctuations over time. Once the data is acquired, a pixel quality assessment is performed to \nidentify and eliminate bad pixels that could introduce artifacts or bias into the analysis. \nSpecifically, 'hot' pixels—those with significantly higher dark counts 23—are detected and \nremoved using a 3-sigma rule. Any pixel that deviates more than three standard deviations from \nthe mean is replaced with NaN to prevent its influence on subsequent calculations, \nimplemented with: \n                                               𝐼[|𝐼−𝐼̅| > 3𝜎] = 𝑁𝑎𝑁.                                                          (6) \nwhere I is the frame data, and 𝐼̅ is the mean intensity of frame data, 𝜎 is the standard \ndeviation of the frame data. \n\n\nOnce bad pixels are identified, they are excluded from further calculations. For valid \npixels, κ is computed, and the BFi is derived using the inverse squared speckle contrast \nformula: BFi = 1/κ². The resulting signal is then subjected to noise reduction algorithms to \nminimize fluctuations caused by external disturbances or system imperfections. Filtering \ntechniques, including a smoothing window of 20, are applied to refine the data and highlight \nphysiologically relevant blood flow variations. Finally, the processed data is visualized, \nenabling the interpretation of BFi dynamics over time. This pipeline ensures the extraction of \naccurate and meaningful blood flow information while minimizing the impact of noise and \nartifacts. \n \nFIG. 3. The DSCA data analysis flow. Once the raw data is acquired, bad pixels (highlighted in red circles) are \nidentified and removed, followed by 𝜅 calculation, noise reduction, and final filtering. The final processed data is \nvisualized for interpretation. The right-side images provide visual insights into raw data, bad pixel identification, \nand signal refinement at different stages.  \n \n \n \n\n\nIII. RESULTS  \nA. Simulation Results \nAs a function of 𝜌  and T, the speckle contrast (𝜅 ) is computed using Eq. (2) and \npresented in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). In FIG. 4(a), 𝜅 decreases with increasing 𝜌 for T = 1, 3, and 5 \nms with a smaller T exhibiting a higher 𝜅. This trend aligns with the expectations that a larger \n𝜌 leads to greater photon scattering and diffusion, thereby reducing 𝜅. FIG. 4(b) demonstrates \nthe nonlinear decrease of 𝜅 and T at various 𝜌 values. As T increases, 𝜅 decreases in a nonlinear \nfashion, with the rate of decrease being more pronounced at a smaller 𝜌 , indicating that a \nshorter T captures more high-frequency speckle fluctuations associated with BF. To further \nexplore this dependency, FIG. 4(c) presents a 3D visualization of 𝜅 as a function of 𝜌 and T. \nThe surface plot clearly shows that 𝜅 is highest at smaller 𝜌 and 𝑇, confirming the interplay \nbetween spatial and temporal factors in speckle contrast dynamics. Finally, FIG. 4(d) presents \nthe relationship between 1\n𝜅2\n⁄\n and 𝛼𝐷𝑏 (BFi), where it is evident that BFi increases linearly \nwith 1\n𝜅2\n⁄\n. Unlike DCS, which requires fitting the second-order correlation function g2, our \ndirect relationship (BFi = 1\n𝜅2\n⁄\n ) simplifies the calculation and improves accuracy and \ncomputational efficiency. The simulations were conducted when λ = 785 nm, 𝜇𝑎 = 0.01 mm−1, \n𝜇𝑠\n′ = 1 mm−1, and the refractive index n = 1.33, representative of a typical tissue-mimicking \nmedium. \n \nFIG. 4.

Measurement Flexibility  \nThe measurement flexibility of the ATLAS-DSCA was assessed by varying the \nTINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS parameter in our custom software. Table II summarizes the \nrelationship between TINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS, exposure time, frame readout time, frame \ntime, and frame rate for the global shutter mode. As the exposure time increases, the frame rate \ndecreases, highlighting the impact of a longer integration period on the data acquisition speed. \nSpecifically, increasing TINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS leads to a proportional rise in the exposure \ntime, significantly reducing the achievable frame rate. For instance, with a clock frequency of \n20 MHz and TINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS set to 32, the system achieves a frame rate of 849.2 \nfps. However, at TINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS = 65,535, the frame rate drops to 9.4 fps. \nTable II.

For example, TINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS values of 32, \n1024, and 4096 correspond to sampling rates of 849.2 Hz, 361.7 Hz, and 130.2 Hz, respectively. \nFewer iterations result in a higher temporal resolution, allowing for the capture of rapid \ndynamics, whereas more iterations produce smoother curves due to the enhanced SNR (SNR \n= 10𝑙𝑜𝑔10(\n𝑆𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟\n𝑁𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒 𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟) ), albeit with a reduced temporal resolution. Here, we obtain SNR \nvalues of 12.10 dB, 25.13 dB, and 30.32 dB for TINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS = 32, 1024, and \n4096, respectively. A lower TINT_TBIN_ITERATIONS means a shorter T, leading to a lower \nκ, which is in good agreement with the simulation results shown in FIG. 4(b). FIG. 5(b) presents \nthe raw signal amplitude for the three iteration settings, highlighting the increased signal \nintensity and noise levels associated with lower iterations. In FIG. 5(c), the power spectral \n\n\ndensity (PSD) analysis, computed using Welch’s method, further reveals the impact of iteration \nsettings on signal frequency content. Welch’s method can estimate the PSD by segmenting the \nsignal into overlapping sections, applying a window function, and averaging the periodograms. \nThe PSD estimate using Welch’s method is given by: \n                              𝑃𝑆𝐷(𝑓) =\n1\n𝑀∑\n𝑃𝑚(𝑓)\n𝑀\n𝑚=1\n, 𝑃𝑚(𝑓) =\n1\n𝑁|𝐹𝐹𝑇(𝑥𝑚)|2,                               (7) \nwhere f is the frequency at which the PSD is estimated, M is the number of overlapping \nsegments into which the signal is divided, and 𝑃𝑚(𝑓) is the periodogram (power spectrum \nfor a given segment) of the m-th segment at f. N is the length of each segment, and 𝑥𝑚 is \nthe m-th segment of the signal. FFT stands for Fast Fourier Transform. By averaging \nmultiple periodograms, Welch’s method reduces variance and provides a smoother \nrepresentation of the frequency components. The low iteration setting (red) allows for higher \nfrequency components to be preserved, whereas increasing the iterations results in a more \nattenuated high-frequency response, favoring smoother signals. These findings emphasize the \ntrade-off between the temporal resolution and signal quality, where fewer iterations improve \ntemporal tracking but introduce higher noise, whereas more iterations enhance signal stability \nat the cost of high-frequency information. These findings highlight the trade-off between the \ntemporal resolution and data quality, underscoring the system’s versatility to meet various \nexperimental needs. The measurements were conducted on the left arm of a healthy volunteer \nat ρ = 12 mm (laser power: 4 mW), with the SPAD sensor set to a clock frequency of 20 MHz \nand TBIN_CLK_PERIODS = 32. The clock frequency is also adjustable (e.g., 50 MHz, 75 \nMHz) depending on experimental requirements. \n\n\n \nFIG. 5.

(b) Raw signal amplitudes across different iteration settings, highlighting variations in signal intensity and \nnoise levels. (c) The power spectral density (PSD) analysis of the signals, demonstrating the impact of iteration \nsettings on frequency content, where lower iterations allow for higher frequency resolution whereas higher \niterations result in smoother signals with reduced high-frequency components. \nC. Phantom and In Vivo Measurements  \n1. Phantom Measurements \nPhantom measurements were performed using a setup that simultaneously compared the \nATLAS-DSCA and a conventional CMOS-DSCA systems. We employed a home-made solid \nsilica phantom (with unmeasured optical properties, as no quantitative calculation was intended) \ncontaining a vibration motor whose intensity can be controlled externally. FIG. 6(a) shows the \nexperimental setup, where a laser illuminates the solid silica phantom through an MMF, and \nscattered light is collected via two separate MMFs: one connected to the ATLAS-DSCA system \nand the other to the CMOS-DSCA system. A vibration motor embedded in the phantom induces \ncontrolled motion, with vibration levels (0, 12, 24, 36, 52) adjusted through an external \ncontroller. FIG. 6(b) presents the time-dependent normalized BFi measured by both systems. \nThe stepwise increases in BFi correspond to different vibration levels applied to the phantom, \nillustrating the responsiveness of ATLAS-DSCA and CMOS-DSCA to dynamic changes. A \nnoticeable discrepancy between the BFi values obtained from the two systems likely reflects \n\n\ninherent differences in their measurement characteristics, such as quantum efficiency, dark \ncurrent, and other detector-specific factors, between CMOS and SPAD detectors. This \ndiscrepancy validates the feasibility of the ATLAS-DSCA method under controlled conditions, \npaving the way for its application in complex in vivo scenarios. \n \nFIG. 6. (a) Experimental setup for DSCA: A laser illuminates a solid silica phantom via an MMF, with scattered \nlight collected by two separate MMFs for ATLAS- and CMOS-DSCA detection. A vibration motor inside the \nphantom generates controlled motion at intensities 0,12,24,35,52. (b) Normalized BFi over time for ATLAS-\nDSCA (blue) and CMOS-DSCA (orange), showing responses to varying vibration levels. \n2. Arm Cuff Occlusion \nTo further demonstrate the ATLAS-DSCA system, in vivo measurements were conducted using \nan arm cuff occlusion model at 𝜌 = 10, 20, and 30 mm. As shown in FIG. 7(a), volunteers sat \ncomfortably with their left arm placed on a pad and the ATLAS-DSCA probe attached to the \nwrist. FIG. 7(b) presents relative BFi (rBFi = BFi / BFibaseline) time series data for four subjects \nat different 𝜌 values, highlighting the microvascular hemodynamic changes during occlusion \nand subsequent recovery. After a baseline period of approximately 3.5 s, a blood pressure cuff \nwas inflated to 200 mmHg for 7 s. Upon cuff release, blood flow recovery was recorded for 4 \ns. The gray-shaded regions indicate the cuff inflation period, during which a marked decrease \nin rBFi is observed. Upon cuff release, the rBFi overshoots to a hyperemic value much larger \nthan the baseline as expected, with varying recovery kinetics across subjects and measurement \ndepths. Notably, the reduction in rBFi is more pronounced at a shorter ρ (ρ = 10 mm), \nsuggesting that superficial microvascular networks exhibit a stronger response than deeper \ntissues, where SNR may be lower.  \n\n\n \nFIG. 7. (a) The schematic representation of the experimental setup, where a blood pressure cuff is placed on the \nupper arm to induce controlled vascular occlusion, with a certain 𝜌. (b) Temporal rBFi variations at 𝜌 = 10, 20, \nand 30 mm for four subjects (Subjects #1~#4). The gray-shaded regions indicate the period of cuff inflation, \nduring which blood flow is restricted. The signals show a characteristic decrease in rBFi during occlusion, \nfollowed by a recovery phase after cuff deflation.  \n3. In Vivo Forehead Measurements \nATLAS-DSCA was also applied to monitor cerebral blood flow on the adult human \nforehead, as shown in FIG. 8(a). FIG. 8(b) represents the temporal variations in normalized \nBFi (blue) and photoplethysmography (PPG, red) signals at ρ = 20 mm and ρ = 25 mm. The \nBFi reflects cerebral blood flow fluctuations, whereas the PPG indicates peripheral blood \nvolume changes. A clear phase shift between the two signals is observed, highlighting the \ndifferences in hemodynamic responses at varying tissue depths. The average intensity, which \nis similar to the PPG signal, serves as an indicator of blood volume 41. In our measurements, \nthe BF waveform exhibits sharper peaks and more detailed features within each cardiac cycle \nthan the PPG waveform, with the BF peak consistently preceding the blood volume peak – a \nphenomenon also reported in Ref. 16.  \n\n\n \nFIG. 8. (a) The schematic representation of the measurement setup. (b) Normalized BFi (in blue) and \nphotoplethysmography (PPG, in red) signals at 𝜌  = 20 and 25 mm. The signals exhibit a clear correlation, \nreflecting hemodynamic fluctuations over time.  \nTo further demonstrate the sensitivity of ATLAS-DSCA, FIG. 9 presents cerebral \nfunction monitoring during a mental arithmetic task (at ρ = 20 mm) in two subjects. FIG. 9(a) \nshows the experimental setup, where the probe was placed on the forehead, targeting the \nprefrontal cortex, which plays a key role in cognitive processes such as reading unfamiliar text, \nplanning, and working memory 42,43. In this experiment, subjects rested for 8 seconds before \nbeing presented with math questions for 30 seconds, followed by a recovery period after \nremoving the questions. FIG. 9(b) illustrates a representative BFi measurement from one \nsubject. The upper and lower envelopes of the BFi signal (denoted as up1 and lo1, respectively) \nwere calculated using MATLAB’s envelope function with the ‘peak’ method (window size = \n250). The trend of the BFi signal is defined as: \n                                                       𝐵𝐹𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑙=\n𝑢𝑝1+𝑙𝑜1\n2\n.                                                           (8)   \nTaking the first 8 seconds as the baseline, the percentage change in BFi is calculated as:  \n \n                                                      BFi changes = \n|𝐵𝐹𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑙−𝐵𝐹𝑖𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒|\n𝐵𝐹𝑖𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒\n× 100%.                     (9) \n \nAs shown in FIG. 9(c) and 9(d), we observed that blood flow significantly increased by \n3.8% to 10.1% (average over three trials per subject) during activation and returned to baseline \nvalues post-activation, consistent with expected physiological responses. The shaded area \nrepresents the standard deviation of the three trials for each subject, calculated using built-in \nMATLAB functions. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using ATLAS-DSCA to \n\n\ntrack neurovascular dynamics in response to cognitive stimuli, offering valuable insights into \ncerebral hemodynamic responses associated with mental effort. \n \nFIG. 9.

The shaded region represents the standard deviation, whereas the dashed vertical lines indicate the \nstart and end of the cognitive task. \nIV. DISCUSSION \nWe introduce the ATLAS-DSCA system, which leverages a 512×512 SPAD array for \nnon-invasive deep tissue blood flow measurement. Our findings show that the ATLAS-DSCA \noffers a comparable performance to traditional CMOS-DSCA systems, but with the added \nbenefit of a higher sampling rate. Validation studies, including arm cuff occlusion, in vivo \nforehead measurements, and cognitive task trials in healthy subjects, all confirm the robustness \nand effectiveness of our approach. \nPhantom experiments (FIG. 6(b)) conducted alongside a CMOS-DSCA system further \nvalidate the reliability of the ATLAS-DSCA. Additionally, arm cuff occlusion studies (FIG. \n7(b)) highlight the system’s ability to assess deep tissue blood flow, demonstrated by the \npronounced hyperaemic response following cuff release. Cognitive task experiments (FIG. 9(c) \nand 9(d)) also show a marked increase in blood flow during mental arithmetic, aligning with \nprevious research 28,44. \n\n\nAs presented in Table I, Kim et al.'s SCOS system achieved ρ = 40 mm with a sampling \nrate of 160 Hz 28. However, their approach involves certain trade-offs, such as the use of lower-\ncost CMOS cameras, which introduce higher readout noise, reduced bit depth, and non-linear \nor non-uniform camera gains. To improve photon flux without exceeding safety limits, they \nimplemented a pulsing strategy (10% duty cycle) with an optical chopper on a volume \nholographic laser, resulting in a more complex optical setup. Additionally, their system \nincorporates a complicated 4f structure, making it bulkier and less portable. \nIn contrast, Huang et al.'s system 29 achieved ρ = 50 mm with a sampling rate of 80 Hz, \nwhich captures low-frequency signals (< 65 Hz), unable to resolve high-frequency components, \nas shown in FIG. 5(c) (blue curve), which may result in missing critical information. However, \nour ATLAS-DSCA system is capable of resolving high-frequency signals (> 200 Hz), making \nit ideal for analyzing dynamic, rapidly changing physiological signals. They used a higher laser \npower (45 mW) to achieve ρ = 50 mm. Their detection probe is designed to place CMOS image \nsensors close to the patient’s skin, eliminating the need for detection fibers. This increases \nphoton collection and improves the SNR, making it ideal for adult stroke diagnostics. However, \nthis design is less suitable for premature or neonatal patients, who require minimal disruption. \nIn comparison, our ATLAS-DSCA system, while achieving ρ = 30 mm, distinguishes \nitself with an exceptional sampling rate exceeding 800 Hz. Not only can it detect human blood \nflow, but it is also suitable for monitoring animal health and wellbeing (for small animals, the \nheart rate typically ranges from 4 to 12.5 Hz, or 240 to 750 beats per minute 45). This high \nsampling rate also opens the door to broader applications, including ultrasound detection, \nassuming the SPAD’s bandwidth and sensitivity support higher frequencies. A major \nadvantage of our system is its flexibility: the ATLAS can incorporate multiple fibers by \ndividing the sensor into several sensing clusters, offering greater versatility. Additionally, the \nATLAS-DSCA system can operate in DCS mode, providing ρ = 50 mm (research results to be \npublished separately) using on-chip autocorrelators 24,46.  \nSeveral studies 26,47–49 have compared DCSA/SCOS and DCS technologies, employing \neither Monte Carlo simulations or separate detectors—one dedicated to DCSA/SCOS and \nanother to DCS. In contrast, our DSCA/DCS system allows switching between DCS and DSCA \nmodes, facilitating a more controlled and direct comparison.  \nFurthermore, there are two main approaches for capturing temporal dynamics: temporal \nsampling methods (such as DCS using SPAD arrays) and speckle ensemble methods (like \nSVS/DSCA and LSCI). While temporal sampling methods require extremely high frame rates \n(above 26 kfps, as highlighted in Wang et al.’s review 34) to capture fast fluctuations, speckle \nensemble methods improve SNR by integrating over multiple speckles. Our work demonstrates \nthat, although SPAD sensors may not be ideal for traditional DCS (calculating g2 using \nsequential frame data), they hold significant promise in DSCA, SCOS, and SVS applications. \nLastly, it is important to note that our SPAD array maintains a high SNR even with very \nshort exposure times (as low as 51.2 µs), thanks to its lack of readout noise and minimal dead \ntime—critical advantages that enhance the performance of the ATLAS-DSCA system.  \nWe believe, recent advancements in SPAD technology—such as the development of \nlarge-area SPAD arrays (512×512) and improved time-gated detection—suggest that SPADs \ncould play a more prominent role in next-generation DSCA/SCOS applications. Their \nunparalleled temporal resolution, high sampling rate and ability to perform time-gated \n\n\nmeasurements make them particularly attractive for deep-tissue blood flow imaging and \nfunctional neuroimaging applications. Moreover, the algorithm we developed for the fiber-\nbased ATLAS-DSCA system (see FIG. 3) may server as an effective foundation for advancing \nSPAD-based DSCA/SCOS methodologies. \nV. CONCLUSION \nIn conclusion, we present a groundbreaking fiber-based, ultra-high-speed DSCA \nsystem using a large-format SPAD camera for non-invasive deep tissue blood flow sensing. By \ncombining a custom-designed SPAD array with cutting-edge optical and signal processing \ntechniques, our system achieves an exceptional temporal resolution and sensitivity, enabling \nthe capture of rapid, dynamic blood flow variations across a broad field of view. Extensive \nexperimental validations—from phantom studies and cuff occlusion tests to in vivo \nmeasurements—demonstrate that our DSCA system reliably detects deep tissue hemodynamic \nchanges and outperforms traditional CMOS-based systems in sampling rate. \nMoreover, the system's high-speed capabilities open the door to a broad range of biomedical \napplications, from human clinical diagnostics to animal physiological monitoring, with \npotential for expanding into ultrasound detection. While this work underscores the \ntransformative potential of large SPAD array cameras in DSCA, we anticipate that future \nsensor technology and signal processing advancements will further elevate its performance and \nbroaden its clinical and research utility. \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThis work has been funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council \n(Grant No. EP/T00097X/1 and No. EP/T020997/1): the Quantum Technology Hub in Quantum \nImaging (QuantiC) and the University of Strathclyde, as well as A*STAR Biomedical \nEngineering Programme (BEP) C221318003 and A*STAR BMRC CRF fund 2024.  \n \nDATA AVAILABILITY \nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding \nauthor upon reasonable request. \n \nDECLARATIONS \nEthics Approval Statement Six healthy participants, aged between 20 and 35 years, with no \nhistory of neurological disorders, were recruited for this study.

However, ensuring that business practices align with evolving regulatory frameworks remains a persistent\nchallenge.

INTRODUCTION\nI\nN recent years, driven by the widespread adoption of\nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Euro-\npean Union has introduced principles and regulations aimed\nat helping organizations integrate environmental, social, and\ngovernance (ESG) factors into their operations and strategic\ndecision-making. These initiatives encourage businesses and\ninvestors to assess and improve their environmental impact,\nfostering a more sustainable approach to economic activity [1].\nAs part of this effort, the ESG taxonomy1 has been established,\noffering a standardized framework to support sustainable prac-\ntices across industries [2]. This resource enables companies to\nevaluate their activities in alignment with its criteria and report\ntheir performance in non-financial disclosures and sustainabil-\nity reports.\nHowever, aligning business practices with regulatory frame-\nworks continues to be a challenge. Financial investors and\nother stakeholders often struggle to determine which aspects of\ncorporate social responsibility correspond to specific activities\nregulated in the ESG taxonomy, making it difficult to accu-\nrately interpret and effectively utilize these reports. Indeed, a\ncompany can be associated with a vast amount of text that,\nin theory, can be mapped to various environmental activities\ndescribed in the taxonomy. This text may include non-financial\ndisclosures, marketing materials, website descriptions, product\nand service descriptions, corporate sustainability reports, and\nManuscript received December xx, 20xx; revised xxx , xxxx.

Thoroughly analyzing all this material is a complex and\ncostly endeavour.\nThe rise of social fintech technologies, which increas-\ningly support intelligent solutions for social impact invest-\ning, presents a promising opportunity to leverage advanced\ncomputational techniques for analyzing financial texts and ex-\ntracting sustainability-related insights. For instance, several AI\nmodels have been developed to classify financial documents\nbased on relevant SDGs [3], [4]. The rapid advancement of\nlarge language models (LLMs) in recent years has further\nimproved automated solutions for the analysis of financial\nand sustainability-related texts [5]–[9]. However, categorizing\ntext based on specific environmental activities, such as those\ndefined in the ESG taxonomy, remains a significant challenge.\nExamples of these activities include promoting low-carbon rail\ntransport, ensuring green port operations with zero direct CO2\nemissions, or expanding infrastructure for cycling and personal\nelectric mobility. This task is considerably more complex than\nlinking text to broad SDG categories, as it requires a fine-\ngrained understanding of the actions and activities described\nin a document. General-purpose LLMs struggle with this\nlevel of specificity. Overcoming these limitations, therefore,\nrequires fine-tuning such models on high-quality, domain-\nspecific datasets – an effort often hindered by the scarcity\nof training data in this domain.\nIn this paper, we explore the ability of current-generation\nLLMs to identify text related to environmental actions. Fur-\nthermore, we demonstrate how their performance can be\nsignificantly enhanced by fine-tuning them on a combination\nof original and synthetically generated data. Specifically, our\nstudy focuses on classifying textual segments extracted from\narXiv:2502.21112v1  [cs.AI]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS, VOL. X, NO. X, XX 20XX\n2\nNon-Financial Disclosures (NFDs) according to the activi-\nties defined in the ESG taxonomy. These activities include\nmeasures such as reducing emissions through energy-efficient\nproduction processes, transitioning to renewable energy, and\nimplementing water conservation strategies, such as wastewa-\nter treatment and reuse in manufacturing plants.\nTo fine-tune and evaluate a range of models on their task,\nwe introduce ESG-Activities, a novel benchmark consisting of\n1,325 texts classified according to ESG activities. Since we\nintended assess the capability of synthetic data in supporting\nAI systems in this domain, the training set of ESG-Activities\nincludes a mixture of manually curated data from human\nexperts and synthetic data generated by LLMs. In contrast,\nthe test set consists exclusively of items curated by human\nexperts to ensure a high-quality evaluation.\nThe evaluation demonstrates that fine-tuning the system\nwith a combination of manually crafted and synthetically\ngenerated data leads to significant improvements, not only\ncompared to zero-shot learning but also over models fine-tuned\nexclusively on the manually annotated dataset. Furthermore,\nwe show that relatively small open-source models, such as\nLlama 7B, can achieve excellent performance when fine-tuned\non ESG-Activities, even surpassing large proprietary models\nin certain configurations.\nIn summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows:\n• We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs on\nthe challenging task of associating textual descriptions\nwith specific environmental activities.\n• We introduce ESG-Activities2, a novel benchmark that\ncombines both original and synthetic data.\n• We demonstrate that augmenting a high-quality, manu-\nally curated dataset for fine-tuning with synthetic data\nenhances the performance of the resulting models on this\ntask.\n• We provide the complete codebase for our analysis to\nensure reproducibility3.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section\nII discusses the use case and provides a formal definition of\nthe task. Section III introduces the new benchmark. Section\nIV describes the methodology adopted in our analysis.

TASK DEFINITION AND USE CASE\nA. The role of ESG taxonomy for social fintech companies\nIn the European landscape, the analysis of social and\nenvironmental impact investments and the assessment of the\nsustainability of companies, including crowdfunding platforms\nor fintech, are becoming increasingly crucial. In 2021, the Eu-\nropean Commission defined a set of ambitious policies related\nto the so-called “European Green Deal” with the overarching\ngoal of making Europe climate-neutral by 2050. Among\n2ESG-Activities\n-\nhttps://github.com/Mattia-Brt/Fine tuning LLM/tree/\nmain/data\n3Codebase - https://github.com/Mattia-Brt/Fine tuning LLM\nother initiatives, the European Green Deal has established a\ntaxonomy that defines the activities companies must undertake\nto enhance their contributions to ESG aspects. This taxonomy\nis becoming a crucial benchmark for European investors,\nwho utilize it to assess the sustainability of their investment\ndecisions. Investors require a thorough understanding of the\nextent to which companies comply with the European ESG\ntaxonomy. This is essential for making informed investment\ndecisions that align with their values and contribute to sus-\ntainable development. However, the complexity of the ESG\ntaxonomy and the vast amount of financial documentation can\nmake it challenging for investors to independently assess a\ncompany’s compliance. As a result, there is an increasing need\nfor tools that can streamline this process by automatically\nidentifying and annotating relevant sections within financial\ndocuments. These tools represent sustainable applications of\nSocial Fintech, showcasing how AI can enhance corporate so-\ncial responsibility. By enabling investors to identify companies\ngenuinely committed to sustainability, these technologies help\ndirect capital toward initiatives aligned with SDGs, such as\nthose outlined in the European Green Deal.\nFurthermore, semi-automatic annotation tools can be seam-\nlessly integrated into Social Fintech platforms, including\ncrowdfunding platforms, reinforcing their dedication to sus-\ntainability and social impact. Automating ESG analysis with\nAI enhances transparency and promotes responsible invest-\nment opportunities, ultimately fostering a more sustainable and\nequitable financial system.\nB. Task definition\nIn this paper, we describe the process of developing an\nLLM tailored to verify if a text portion from NFD relates to\na particular item in the ESG taxonomy. The task is framed as\na binary classification problem, where the goal is to train the\nLLM to answer the question: Does c pertain to i?. Specifically,\nfor a text segment c and an item i – in this case, the description\nof an ESG activity – the formulated fine-tuned LLM function\nf(c, i) is expressed as:\nf(c, i) =\n(\n1\nif c pertains to i,\n0\notherwise.\nThe aim of the fine-tuned LLM is to learn a mapping function\nf that accurately assigns each pair (c, i) to the correct class.\nThis fine-tuning process is performed using a dataset of\ntriples (c, i, class), where c is a text chunk, i is an activity\ndescription in the ESG taxonomy, and class ∈{0, 1} indicates\nwhether c is related to i. The goal is to minimize the binary\ncross-entropy loss:\nL = −1\nN\nN\nX\nj=1\n[yj log ˆyj + (1 −yj) log(1 −ˆyj)] ,\nwhere N is the number of samples in the dataset, yj is the\ntrue label (class) for the j-th sample, and ˆyj = f(cj, ij) is the\npredicted probability that cj pertains to ij.\n\n\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS, VOL. X, NO. X, XX 20XX\n3\nThe fine-tuning process was performed using the Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA) technique [10], which updates only a low-\nrank subspace of the model’s pre-trained weight matrices,\nreducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining\nefficiency. Let W be a weight matrix from the pre-trained\nmodel. During fine-tuning, the adaptation introduces a low-\nrank update ∆W:\n∆W = AB,\nwhere A ∈Rm×r and B ∈Rr×n, r ≪min(m, n), ensuring\nefficiency in storage and computation.\nThe updated weight matrix becomes:\nW ′ = W + ∆W = W + AB.\nBy freezing the original weights W and only optimizing\nA and B, LoRA enables efficient fine-tuning with minimal\ncomputational overhead.\nIII. THE ESG-ACTIVITIES BENCHMARK\nTo the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset has been\nexplicitly designed to enhance an LLM’s ability to classify\ntext based on precise and granular environmental activities,\nsuch as those defined in the ESG taxonomy. To address this\ngap, we introduce ESG-Activities, a novel benchmark dataset.\nESG-Activities links textual segments from NFDs to specific\nactivities defined in the ESG taxonomy. The dataset was\nconstructed following the process outlined below.\nFirst, we selected the NFDs of four major companies within\nthe transportation industry. The selected companies were Fer-\nrovie dello Stato, the Italian State Railways; Autostrade per\nl’Italia, Italy’s largest company for motorway management\nand maintenance; Maersk, a well-known shipping and logistics\ncompany; and Mundys, a multinational company specializing\nin motorway and airport infrastructure. Next, we selected\n12 activities related to the transport industry from the ESG\ntaxonomy. These activities represent various actions that com-\npanies can take to promote sustainability in the transportation\nsector, such as developing zero-emission vessel infrastructure\nwith electric charging and hydrogen refuelling, implementing\nsmart mobility systems to enhance traffic efficiency, promoting\nlow-carbon rail transport with CO2-free or bimodal trains,\nexpanding infrastructure for walking, cycling, and personal\nelectric mobility, and ensuring green port operations with zero\ndirect CO2 emissions.\nSince the original descriptions were too long, we generated\nshorter versions using GPT-4 as a rephraser. We then indexed\nthe NFDs in a vector database and employed a Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation (RAG) [11] pipeline to retrieve the\nmost relevant text chunks for each activity description. This\nprocess yielded 265 candidate mappings between text seg-\nments and ESG actions.\nThe candidate mappings were evaluated by three domain\nexperts – professors and postdoctoral researchers with exper-\ntise in the transport industry. Each annotator independently\nassessed whether to confirm or reject each candidate mapping.\nA mapping was deemed valid if it received at least two positive\nvotes out of three, following a majority rule. The resulting\ndataset consisted of 265 entries, each containing a textual\ndescription, an activity description, and a binary flag indicating\na match. Among these, 78 text-activity pairs were classified\nas true matches. The dataset was then split into a training set\nof 212 instances and a test set of 53 instances.\nSince we aimed to verify the effectiveness of syntactic\ndata in this domain, we then expanded the training set with\nartificial data. Specifically, we used ChatGPT-4o to generate\nfive alternative formulations for each of the original 212\nsentences in the training set, ensuring they conveyed the\nsame meaning while using different wording. This process\nresulted in 1,060 additional sentences, which were labelled\nas ’synthetic data’ and incorporated into the training set. This\nsetup allows users of the benchmark to fine-tune their models\nusing only the original data (212 items) or a combination of\noriginal and syntactic data (1272 items).\nIV. METHODOLOGY\nIn this section, we first introduce ESGQuest, the prototype\nwe developed for analysing documents and mapping them\nto ESG activities using an LLM fine-tuned for this task.\nWe then provide an overview of the LLMs evaluated in this\nstudy and describe the experimental setup used to assess their\nperformance on the ESG-Activities benchmark.\nA. System Architecture\nThe study presented in this paper is part of a broader project\naimed at developing ESGQuest, a research prototype designed\nto support the annotation of NFD with ESG-related activities.\nThis system is built on a RAG pipeline. Given a document\nabout a company and a set of relevant NACE codes, ESGQuest\naims to identify text segments that align with ESG activities\nassociated with the specified NACE codes. The results are\npresented as an annotated PDF, which can be further refined\nby human users.4 The ESGQuest pipeline operates as follows.\nFirst, ESGQuest selects ESG activities based on the given\nNACE codes using a predefined mapping schema. NACE codes\n(Nomenclature statistique des Activit´es ´economiques dans la\nCommunaut´e Europ´eenne) are a European industry standard\nclassification system that groups organizations based on their\neconomic activities.5 This step is optional but generally ben-\neficial, as many ESG activities described in the taxonomy\nare relevant only to specific industrial sectors (e.g., transport,\nenergy). Including irrelevant activities in the analysis would\nnot only waste computational resources but also introduce\nunnecessary complexity and potential confusion.\nSecond, the input documents are divided into smaller chunks\nand stored in Pinecone6, a vector database optimized for\nsimilarity search. Pinecone facilitates the efficient retrieval of\nthe most semantically relevant segments for a given query by\n4A demo of this system is available at https://esgquest.datai.disco.unimib.it.\n5These codes are used in the EU Taxonomy to assess the environmental\nsustainability of economic activities.

X, XX 20XX\n4\nleveraging high-dimensional vector embeddings. It is specif-\nically designed for approximate nearest neighbour search,\nensuring fast and scalable retrieval even for large datasets.\nThird, for each relevant ESG activity, the system queries\nthe vector database with the activity description to retrieve the\nmost pertinent chunks from the input documents.\nFinally, an LLM optimized for this purpose analyzed each\nchunk to assess whether it aligned with the description of the\naction. If a chunk is assigned to an action, the corresponding\ntext segment in the original PDF is annotated accordingly.\nB. Large Language Models\nIn this paper, we examine a range of LLMs, including sev-\neral open-source models, which offer a cost-effective solution\nand can be deployed locally to ensure the privacy of sensitive\ndocuments, as well as a large proprietary model (GPT-4o\nMini). Below, we provide a description of each LLM evaluated\nin this paper, including their sizes and key characteristics.\n1) Llama.\nLlama, introduced by Hugo Touvron et al. in 2023 [5], is\na family of decoder-only language models designed to deliver\nhigh performance and computational efficiency. The Llama\nmodels range from 1 to 90 billion parameters, making them\nsuitable for a wide variety of natural language processing\napplications. In this study, we evaluate three versions: Llama\n3B, Llama 2 7B, and Llama 3 8B, all available on official\nplatforms such as Hugging Face.\nLlama 3B7 is an open-source model with 3 billion parame-\nters. The model incorporates architectural enhancements such\nas pre-normalization and the SwiGLU activation function [12],\nwhich contribute to training stability and efficiency.\nLlama 2 7B8, represents an evolution of the first generation\nof Llama [13]. It was trained using additional data and\noptimized techniques to improve generalization. This model\nexcels in zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks and directly\ncompetes with larger models like GPT-3 and Chinchilla [14].\nLlama 3 8B9, is the latest iteration in the series. This\nmodel, featuring 8 billion parameters, was trained on a dataset\nexceeding 15 trillion tokens [15]. It incorporates significant\nadvancements such as odds ratio preference optimization [16],\nwhich optimizes performance and alignment.\nThe Llama series was trained on diverse datasets, compris-\ning publicly available data such as CommonCrawl, C4 [17],\nGitHub, Wikipedia, Books3 [18], ArXiv, and Stack Exchange.\nThese models have demonstrated excellent performance in\nbenchmarks such as NaturalQuestions [19] and TriviaQA [20],\noften surpassing larger models like Gopher (280B) [21] and\nChinchilla (70B) [14]. For instance, the Llama 33B model out-\nperformed both Gopher and Chinchilla in question-answering\ntasks on the NaturalQuestions benchmark, demonstrating that\nthe Llama architecture effectively balances size and perfor-\nmance.\n7https://huggingface.co/openlm-research/open Llama 3b\n8https://huggingface.co/meta-Llama/Llama-2-7b-hf\n9https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B\n2) Gemma.\nIntroduced by Google in 2024, Gemma [6] is a family\nof open-source language models derived from the Gemini\nseries [7], designed to achieve an optimal balance between\ncomputational efficiency and performance across various nat-\nural language processing tasks. The models are available in\nthree configurations – 2B, 7B, and 27B parameters – each\ntailored for specific applications. Gemma employs a decoder-\nonly architecture with advanced features such as multi-query\nattention to reduce memory overhead [22], Rotary Position\nEmbeddings (RoPE) [17] to improve positional representation,\nGeGLU activations for better convergence during training,\nand RMSNorm to enhance stability on large-scale datasets.\nThe models were trained on diverse publicly available data,\nincluding CommonCrawl, C4 [17], GitHub repositories, ArXiv\npapers, Wikipedia, and Books3 [18], ensuring broad linguistic\ncoverage and domain-specific expertise. The 2B model10 is op-\ntimized for on-device deployments and CPU-based inference,\nmaking it efficient for general-purpose applications. The 7B\nvariant11 is fine-tuned for complex tasks like advanced coding,\nscientific reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving, out-\nperforming comparable models such as Llama 7B [5] and often\nrivalling Mistral 7B [8]. The Recurrent Gemma 2B model12\nintroduces a recurrent mechanism that enhances performance\non sequential reasoning tasks and long-context processing,\nmaking it particularly effective for multi-turn dialogues and\nstructured data analysis [23]. Across multiple benchmarks,\nincluding coding, reasoning, and question answering, Gemma\nmodels have demonstrated competitive performance.\n3) Mistral.\nMistral, introduced by Albert Q. Jiang et al. in 2023 [8], is\na highly efficient decoder-only language model designed for\na wide array of natural language processing tasks, excelling\nin areas such as reasoning, mathematics, code generation,\nand commonsense reasoning. With 7.3 billion parameters,\nMistral was specifically engineered to achieve a balance be-\ntween computational efficiency and performance. The model\nincorporates several advanced techniques that make it highly\neffective for tasks that demand long-context processing and\nmemory optimization. One such technique is the sliding win-\ndow attention (SWA) [24], which enables the model to process\nlong sequences of input in overlapping chunks, allowing it to\nhandle inputs of arbitrary length with minimal computational\noverhead. In addition, Mistral utilizes grouped-query attention\n(GQA) [25], a method that optimizes inference speed by\nreducing memory usage during the attention computation\nphase.\nMistral’s ability to maintain performance despite having a\nsmaller parameter count than other models makes it a powerful\ntool for practical applications, especially where computational\nresources may be limited. It consistently outperforms larger\nmodels like Llama 2 13B [5], Llama 1 34B [26], and other\nestablished benchmarks across a variety of metrics.

The\nmodel is also capable of achieving state-of-the-art results on\ntasks requiring a deep understanding of specialized knowl-\nedge, such as those found in academic papers or technical\ndocuments.\n4) Gpt-4o Mini.\nGPT-4o Mini is a decoder-only language model developed\nby OpenAI as a faster and more cost-effective alternative\nto GPT-4o. GPT-4o is a comprehensive multimodal model\ncapable of processing and generating text, images, and au-\ndio, designed for complex tasks requiring high computational\npower and precision. It features a 128K-token context window\nand supports up to 16K output tokens per request, with a\nknowledge cutoff in October 2023 [9]. Despite its smaller\nsize, GPT-4o Mini outperforms previous models, such as GPT-\n3.5 Turbo, in academic benchmarks, demonstrating superior\nperformance in textual intelligence and multimodal reason-\ning [27]. It retains the same context window and output token\nlimits as GPT-4o, ensuring robust performance across various\napplications. Additionally, GPT-4o Mini incorporates an in-\nstruction hierarchy method to enhance resistance to jailbreaks\nand prompt injections, improving security for deployment in\ndiverse settings [28].\nC. Experimental Setup\nIn order to study the advantages of fine-tuning LLMs for\nESG activity classification, we evaluated the models in two\ndifferent modes: zero-shot and fine-tuning. The fine-tuning\nwas performed on the two alternative training sets within ESG-\nactivities: the manually curated dataset of 212 instances and a\nlarger dataset of 1,272 instances, which combines original and\nsynthetic data. In the following sections, we provide a detailed\ndiscussion of both approaches.\n1) Zero-shot\nZero-shot learning is a method in which a LLM is prompted\nto perform a task based solely on provided instructions,\nwithout the need for task-specific examples. This approach\nleverages the extensive pretraining of LLMs, allowing them to\ngeneralize to new, previously unseen tasks. It is particularly\nvaluable because it eliminates the need for additional task-\nspecific training data, making it a cost-effective and scalable\nsolution across various applications.\nIn this study, we designed and iteratively refined a prompt\ntemplate for zero-shot classification. The template takes two\ninputs: 1) the text to be classified and 2) a description of an\nESG action. Based on these inputs, the prompt instructs the\nLLM to return a value of 1 if the text aligns with the ESG\naction and 0 otherwise.\n2) Fine-tuning\nFine-tuning is a supervised learning technique that involves\nadjusting the weights of a pre-trained LLM using a labelled\n13https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1\ndataset. This process refines the model’s broad language\nunderstanding and knowledge acquired during its initial pre-\ntraining phase, enabling it to achieve superior performance on\nspecific tasks or within particular domains.\nIn this study, we fine-tuned eight LLMs for the proposed\ntask using the training and validation datasets from the ESG-\nAction benchmark. Specifically, each model was fine-tuned\ntwice: first using the manually curated training and validation\ndatasets, and then using augmented datasets that included\nsynthetic data. This approach enables a comparative analysis\nof the two model versions, allowing us to evaluate the impact\nof synthetic data on models of different sizes.\nDue to the limited size of our training dataset, we employed a\n10-fold cross-validation approach to mitigate the risk of over-\nfitting. This technique systematically partitions the dataset into\nten subsets, ensuring that the model is trained and evaluated\non different data portions in each iteration. By rotating the\nvalidation set across all folds, cross-validation reduces bias\nand variance, leading to a more reliable assessment of the\nmodel’s generalization capability and performance metrics.\nModels were then saved after each epoch, and validation was\nconducted at regular intervals, referred to as steps. Specifically,\nthe models were evaluated and saved every 10% of the total\noptimization steps. This strategy enables the selection of\nthe best-performing model based on validation metrics and\nmitigates issues like overfitting or underfitting.\nThe optimization process was handled using the AdamW opti-\nmizer [29], a variant of the Adam optimizer that incorporates\ndecoupled weight decay regularization. To optimize the fine-\ntuning process, we employed LoRA techniques from the\nPEFT library, as previously mentioned. This approach reduces\nthe number of trainable parameters while preserving model\nperformance. For instance, when fine-tuning Llama 3B, which\nhas over 3.3 billion parameters, LoRA required modifying only\n0.08% of the total parameter space. Similarly, for Llama 7B,\nonly 0.12% of its parameters were updated.\nThe only exception to this procedure was GPT-4o Mini,\nwhich we fine-tuned using Azure OpenAI14, a cloud-based\nservice provided by Microsoft that enables access to OpenAI’s\nlanguage models. We formatted the training dataset in the\nrequired JSON structure, uploaded it to Azure, and executed\nthe fine-tuning process with the default hyperparameters.\nV. EVALUATION\nIn this section, we present the results of our experiments on\nthe ESG-Activities benchmark. Specifically, we evaluated the\neight LLMs described in Section IV using three alternative\nconfigurations: 1) zero-shot learning, 2) fine-tuning on the\noriginal data from ESG-Activities, and 3) fine-tuning on a\ncombination of the original and synthetic data. All models\nwere tested on the test set of ESG-Activities.\nAs the task is framed as a binary classification problem, we\nused precision, recall, and F1 score as evaluation metrics.\n14Azure OpenAI - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/\nopenai-service\n\n\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS, VOL.

Conversely, RecurrentGEMMA_2B and MISTRAL\nshowed relatively poor performance in this task.

It is interesting that the smaller\nmodel achieved the best performance after fine-tuning. This is\nlikely due to the fact that the manually curated training set is\nrelatively small.

These\nfindings also provide further evidence supporting the effec-\ntiveness of synthetic data in specific domains. Notably, the\nmost comprehensive version of the ESG-Activities benchmark\ntraining set, which combines both manually annotated and syn-\nthetic data, further improves classification performance.

All models, except\nGPT4o_mini, were trained on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. The\nhourly rental rate for an A100 machine was approximately\n$9 at the time of this study. Differently, the fine-tuning of\nGPT4o_mini was conducted using OpenAI’s standard API\noffering, which, at the time of writing, allowed fine-tuning at a\ncost of $3.00 per 1 million tokens. For these reasons, although\nGPT4o_mini is the largest model in terms of the number of\nparameters, it is the cheapest to train using OpenAI’s services.\nHowever, this training cost must be combined with the fees\nrequired to deploy and maintain the model on OpenAI’s\ninfrastructure, which is currently $1.62 an hour. Among the\nopen models, the most cost-effective to fine-tune with our\nconfiguration are Gemma_2B and Gemma_7B.\nVI. RELATED WORK\nThis section examines key advancements in the development\nand application of LLMs in the ESG domain. LLMs have\ndemonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing textual\ndata at scale, enabling the accurate extraction and synthesis\nof information from diverse sources, including research pa-\npers [30], patents [31], medical records [32], social media\nposts [33], news articles [34], technical documentation [35],\nlegal texts [36], and financial documents [37]–[39].\nRecent LLM families, including GPT [9], Llama [5], Mis-\ntral [8], and Gemma [6], have demonstrated outstanding\ncapabilities in analyzing and classifying ESG and financial\ndata. Their proficiency in processing vast amounts of un-\nstructured information positions them as powerful tools for\nenhancing ESG reporting, regulatory compliance, and data-\ndriven decision-making. However, the standard versions of\nthese models, when used with simple prompting, do not always\nachieve optimal performance. Consequently, many researchers\nfocus on developing domain-specific adaptations by fine-\ntuning open models on ESG and financial data. For instance,\nYang et al. [40] introduced FinGPT, an open-source LLM\ndesigned for the financial sector. Initially trained on a general-\npurpose corpus, FinGPT was then fine-tuned using domain-\nspecific datasets, including financial news, earnings reports,\nand real-time market data. This process enables the model\nto capture the nuanced complexities of financial language,\nimproving its performance in tasks such as market forecast-\ning, sentiment analysis, and news classification. As a result,\nFinGPT can be applied to various use cases, including robo-\nadvising, algorithmic trading, and low-code development.\nFinBERT [41] is a domain-specific adaptation of BERT [42]\ndesigned for financial text analysis. It is pre-trained on a\nvast corpus of financial documents, including regulatory fil-\nings, corporate announcements, and financial articles, before\nundergoing fine-tuning for specific tasks. This specialized\ntraining enables FinBERT to develop a deep understanding\nof financial terminology and contextual nuances. Notably,\nit has demonstrated exceptional performance in sentiment\nclassification of financial analyst reports. Similarly, ESG-\nBERT [43] is a specialized variant of BERT that has been pre-\ntrained on a large corpus of sustainability-related texts. This\nmodel has demonstrated strong performance in various natural\nlanguage processing tasks within the ESG domain, particularly\nin text classification and sentiment analysis [44]. We initially\nexplored adapting these models to the task analyzed in this\npaper; however, this approach proved unfeasible. These models\nare trained for specific classification tasks with predefined\nlabels, making it difficult to adapt them for matching a text\nwith an arbitrary activity description.\nSeveral approaches have been proposed for ESG sentiment\nclassification, which involves categorizing text as either pos-\nitive/opportunity or negative/risk from an ESG perspective.\nNotably, the ML-ESG-2 shared task [45], co-located with\nthe FinNLP workshop at IJCNLP-AACL 2023, has played a\nkey role in advancing methodologies in this field. To tackle\nthis challenge, researchers have leveraged both encoder-only\nand decoder-only transformer models, including fine-tuned\nversions of FinBERT [46] and LLMs such as Llama 2 and\nDolly [47]. Similar to previous approaches, we leverage and\nevaluate a variety of fine-tuned language models. However, the\ntask addressed in this paper is more fine-grained than merely\ndetecting a positive or negative sentiment.\nTo tackle the challenges of long contexts and data recency\nin LLMs, researchers have started incorporating the RAG\nparadigm [11], which improves response accuracy by dynami-\ncally retrieving relevant information. For instance, ESGReveal\n[47] is a recent method for extracting and analyzing ESG\ndata from corporate reports that utilizes an LLM augmented\nwith RAG. The system includes an ESG metadata module\nfor precise querying, a preprocessing module for database\nconstruction, and an LLM agent for extracting information.\nLike our approach, ESGReveal leverages an RAG architecture.\nHowever, its primary focus is on extracting quantitative data\nfrom documents, such as Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.\nIn contrast, our work is centred on identifying portions of\ndocuments that align with the activities described in the ESG\ntaxonomy. Furthermore, ESGReveal utilizes zero-shot learning\nLLMs with basic prompting, whereas we fine-tune LLMs to\noptimize their performance for our specific task.\nEfforts have also been made to develop a question-\nanswering system in the ESG domain using a pipeline based\non Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(KG-RAG) [48]. Unlike traditional RAG, which retrieves in-\n\n\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS, VOL. X, NO. X, XX 20XX\n8\nformation from textual sources, KG-RAG leverages knowledge\ngraphs [49], which are structured representations of infor-\nmation that capture relationships between entities in a graph\nformat. Similarly, Angioni et al. [50] employ a combination\nof linguistic pattern analysis and transformer models to extract\na knowledge graph from a corpus of news articles, aiming to\ncapture key trends related to ESG aspects. In this work, we\nfocus on the more specific task of classifying text based on\nESG activities. Consequently, we rely exclusively on action\ndescriptions from the ESG taxonomy rather than employing a\nmore complex knowledge representation.\nVII. CONCUSION\nIn this paper, we investigate the ability of current-generation\nLLMs to identify text related to ESG activities. Specifically,\nwe assess strategies for optimizing these models using high-\nquality data and explore the feasibility of leveraging a combi-\nnation of original and synthetically generated data. To support\nthis study, we introduce ESG-Activities, a novel benchmark\ncomprising 1,325 labelled text segments classified according\nto the EU ESG taxonomy.\nOur results demonstrate that fine-tuned models significantly\noutperform zero-shot approaches, confirming that domain\nadaptation plays a crucial role in enhancing ESG text clas-\nsification. Moreover, the inclusion of synthetic data proved to\nbe a valuable strategy, yielding substantial performance gains\nacross multiple model architectures. This finding suggests that\nsynthetic data augmentation can serve as an effective method\nto overcome data scarcity issues, particularly in specialized\ndomains such as ESG analysis.\nAnother key takeaway from our experiments is that rel-\natively small, open-source models can achieve competitive\nperformance levels when fine-tuned with high-quality, domain-\nspecific data. This insight has significant implications for\norganizations looking to deploy cost-effective AI solutions for\nESG analysis or those that need to run models locally due\nto privacy and data security concerns, which are particularly\ncommon in the financial domain.\nThis study opens several promising avenues for future\nresearch. First, we plan to explore alternative data genera-\ntion techniques, including human-in-the-loop approaches, to\nfurther refine synthetic data for ESG applications. Second,\nwhile our work focused on ESG-related sentence classification,\nfurther research is needed to evaluate the models’ perfor-\nmance on other NLP tasks, such as ESG sentiment analysis\nand risk assessment. Finally, future studies should examine\nhow these models can be effectively deployed in real-world\nfinancial decision-making processes, ensuring that AI-driven\nESG analysis aligns with regulatory requirements and industry\nstandards.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work is supported by the Italian Ministry of University\nand Research (MUR) within the PRIN2022—ISALDI: Inter-\npretable Stock Analysis Leveraging Deep multImodal models\n(CUP: E53D23008150006).\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.

To address these limitations and advance the utility of NP models as general\nregressors, we introduce Dimension Agnostic Neural Process (DANP). DANP in-\ncorporates Dimension Aggregator Block (DAB) to transform input features into a\nfixed-dimensional space, enhancing the model’s ability to handle diverse datasets.\nFurthermore, leveraging the Transformer architecture and latent encoding layers,\nDANP learns a wider range of features that are generalizable across various tasks.\nThrough comprehensive experimentation on various synthetic and practical regres-\nsion tasks, we empirically show that DANP outperforms previous NP variations,\nshowcasing its effectiveness in overcoming the limitations of traditional NP models\nand its potential for broader applicability in diverse regression scenarios.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nIn real-world datasets, there are many tasks that come with various configurations (such as input\nfeature dimensions, quantity of training data points, correlation between training and validation data,\netc.). However, each task has a limited number of data points available, making it difficult to train\na model capable of robust generalization solely based on the provided training data. To tackle this\nissue, meta-learning aims to train a model capable of generalizing to new tasks with few labeled\ndata by learning generally shared features from diverse training task datasets. In cases of limited\nlabeled data for new target tasks, ensuring model trustworthiness involves accurately quantifying\nprediction uncertainty, which is as critical as achieving precise predictions. A meta-learning strategy\nthat considers prediction uncertainty during training and evaluation is known as uncertainty-aware\nmeta-learning (Nguyen & Grover, 2022; Almecija et al., 2022).\nOne of the well-known uncertainty-aware meta-learning methods is Neural Process (NP) (Garnelo\net al., 2018a;b). NP employs meta-learning to understand the data-generation process governing\nthe relationship between input-output pairs in meta-training and meta-validation data. Unlike the\ntraditional approach to learning stochastic processes, where model selection from a known class, e.g.\nGaussian Processes (GPs), precedes computing predictive distributions based on training data, NP\nconstructs an implicit stochastic process using parametric neural networks trained on meta-training\ndata. It then optimizes parameters to maximize the predictive likelihood for both the meta-train and\nmeta-validation data. Consequently, when NP effectively learns the data-generation process solely\nfrom data, it can quickly identify suitable stochastic processes for new tasks. Thus, NP can be viewed\nas a data-driven uncertainty-aware meta-learning method for defining stochastic processes.\nHowever, previous works (Gordon et al., 2020; Foong et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Nguyen & Grover,\n2022; Lee et al., 2023) in NP literature lack two crucial attributes essential for broad applicability\nacross different regression tasks: 1) the ability to directly accommodate diverse input and output\ndimensions, and 2) the adaptability of learned features for fine-tuning on new tasks that exhibit\nvarying input and output dimensions. Due to the absence of these two properties, it is necessary\n1\narXiv:2502.20661v1  [cs.LG]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nto train each NP model separately for different dimensional tasks. These limitations hinder the\nutility of NP models as general regressors across diverse datasets compared to traditional stochastic\nprocesses (Lee et al., 2021). Traditional stochastic processes naturally accommodate varying input\ndimensions, particularly in regression tasks involving high-dimensional input features with limited\ntraining data, such as hyperparameter optimization tasks.\nTo tackle these limitations and advance the utilization of NP models as general regressors for a\nwide range of regression tasks, we introduce a novel extension of NP called Dimension Agnostic\nNeural Process (DANP). In DANP, we propose a module called Dimension Aggregator Block (DAB),\nwhich transforms input features of varying dimensions into a fixed-dimensional representation space.\nThis allows subsequent NP modules to effectively handle diverse datasets and generate predictive\ndensity for the meta-validation data. We also add the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al.,\n2017) alongside latent encoding layers based on the architecture of Transformer Neural Processes\n(TNP) (Nguyen & Grover, 2022) to enhance the model’s ability to learn a wider range of features\nand effectively capture functional uncertainty, which can be applied across different tasks. Through\nexperimentation on a variety of synthetic and real-world regression tasks with various situations,\nwe show that DANP achieves notably superior predictive performance compared to previous NP\nvariations.\n2\nBACKGROUND\n2.1\nPROBLEM SETTINGS\nLet X be an input space defined as S\ni∈N Xi with each Xi ⊆Ri for all i ∈N. Similarly, let Y =\nS\ni∈N Yi represent the output space, where each Yi ⊆Ri for all i ∈N. Let T = {τj}j∈N be a task set\ndrawn in i.i.d. fashion from a task distribution ptask(τ). Given two dimension mapping functions u, v :\nN →N, each task τj comprises a dataset Dj = {dj,k}nj\nk=1, where dj,k = (xj,k, yj,k) ∈Xu(j)×Yv(j)\nrepresents an input-output data pair, along with an index set cj ⊊[nj] where [m] := {1, . . . , m}\nfor all m ∈N. We assume elements in Dj are i.i.d. conditioned on some function fj. Here, the\nset of indices cj defines the context set Dj,c := {dj,k}k∈cj. Similarly, the target set is defined as\nDj,t := {dj,k}k∈tj where tj := [nj] \\ cj. We aim to meta-learn a collection of random functions\nfj : Xu(j) →Yv(j), where each function within this set effectively captures and explains the\nconnection between input x and output y pairs. For any given meta-training task τj, we can regard its\ncontext set Dj,c as the meta-training set and its target set Dj,t as the meta-validation set.\n2.2\nNEURAL PROCESSES\nFor the previous NP variants, their objective was to meta-learn a set of random functions fj : Xdin →\nYdout, for some fixed din, dout ∈N, which is equal to the situation where dimension mapping functions\nu, v are constant functions, i.e., u(j) = din and v(j) = dout for all j ∈N. In this context, to select\na suitable random function fj for the task τj, NPs meta-learns how to map the context set Dj,c to\na random function fj that effectively represents both the context set Dj,c and the target set Dj,t.\nThis entails maximizing the likelihood for both meta-training and meta-validation datasets within an\nuncertainty-aware meta-training framework. The process involves learning a predictive density that\nmaximizes the likelihood using the following equation:\np(Yj|Xj, Dj,c) =\nZ \u0014 Y\nk∈[nj]\np(yj,k|fj, xj,k)\n\u0015\np(fj|Dj,c)dfj,\n(1)\nwhere Xj = {xj,k}nj\nk=1 and Yj = {yj,k}nj\nk=1. In line with our discussion in Section 2.1, we make\nthe assumption that given the random function fj, the outputs collection Yj are i.i.d. Employing the\nGaussian likelihood and parameterizing fj with latent variable rj ∈Rdj, Eq. 1 reduces to,\np(Yj|Xj, Dj,c) =\nZ \u0014 Y\nk∈[nj]\nN\n\u0010\nyj,k|µrj(xj,k), diag(σ2\nrj(xj,k))\n\u0011 \u0015\np(rj|Dj,c)drj,\n(2)\nwhere µrj : Xdin →Ydout and σ2\nrj : Xdin →Rdout\n+ .\nThen different NP variants aim to ef-\nfectively design the model structures of the encoder, denoted as fenc, and the decoder, de-\n2\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nFigure 1: Model comparison between TNP and DANP. While TNP (Nguyen & Grover, 2022) solely\nemploys a deterministic pathway with Masked Transformer layers, DANP incorporates both DAB and\nan extra latent pathway alongside Transformer layers and a Self-Attention layer.\nnoted as fdec. These components are responsible for describing the distributions p(rj|Dj,c) and\nN\n\u0010\nyj,k|µrj(xj,k), diag(σ2\nrj(xj,k))\n\u0011\n, respectively.\nNP variations can be roughly categorized into two classes based on their approach to modeling\np(rj|Dj,c): 1) Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs) (Garnelo et al., 2018a; Gordon et al., 2020;\nNguyen & Grover, 2022) and 2) (latent) NPs (Garnelo et al., 2018b; Foong et al., 2020; Lee et al.,\n2023). CNPs establish a deterministic function, called deterministic path, from Dj,c to rj and represent\np(rj|Dj,c) as a discrete point measure, expressed as:\np(rj|Dj,c) = δ¯rj(r),\n¯rj = fenc(Dj,c; ϕ),\n(3)\nwhere ϕ is the parameter of fenc. In contrast, NPs address functional uncertainty or model uncertainty\nin modeling p(rj|Dj,c). Typically, they employ a variational posterior q(rj|Dj,s), called latent path,\nto approximate p(rj|Dj,s) for any subset Dj,s ⊆Dj, defined as:\nq(rj|Dj,s) = N(rj|mDj,s, diag(s2\nDj,s)),\n(mDj,s, s2\nDj,s) = fenc(Dj,s; ϕ).\n(4)\nThen both of the classes decode the mean and variance of the input xj,k as follows:\n(µrj(xj,k), σ2\nrj(xj,k)) = fdec(xj,k, rj; ψ),\n(5)\nwhere fdec is another feedforward neural net ψ.\nTraining CNPs involves maximizing the average predictive log-likelihood across meta-training tasks\nτj, i.e. Eτj[log p(Yj|Xj, Dj,c)]. On the other hand, NPs are typically trained by maximizing the\nEvidence Lower BOund (ELBO), which is expressed as:\nEτj[log p(Yj|Xj, Dj,c)] ≥Eτj\n\nX\nk∈[nj]\nEq(rj|Dj) [log Nj,k] −KL[q(rj|Dj)|q(rj|Dj,c)]\n\n,\n(6)\nwhere Nj,k is a shorthand for N\n\u0010\nyj,k|µrj(xj,k), diag(σ2\nrj(xj,k))\n\u0011\n.\nThere have been several attempts to enhance the flexibility of the encoder fenc to improve the\npredictive performance (Garnelo et al., 2018a; Kim et al., 2018; Gordon et al., 2020; Nguyen &\nGrover, 2022). In this study, we adopt the state-of-the-art TNP model as our base structure, which\nleverages masked self-attention layers as encoding layers and also belongs to the category of CNPs\nvariants.\n3\nDIMENSION AGNOSTIC NEURAL PROCESS\nAs we mentioned in Section 1 and Section 2.2, the limitation of the previous NP variants is that they\nprimarily handle scenarios where the input space and output space are confined to Xdin and Ydout\nfor the fixed din, dout ∈N. To address this constraint, we introduce a novel NP variant called DANP.\nInitially, we elucidate how the predictive density evolves when the dimension mapping functions u, v\nare not constant in Section 3.1. Subsequently, we expound on how we can convert input features\nof varying dimensions into a fixed-dimensional representation space utilizing the DAB module in\nSection 3.2. Finally, we detail the strategies employed to augment the model’s capacity for learning\ndiverse features in Section 3.3.\n3\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n3.1\nA MODEL OF PREDICTIVE DENSITY WITH VARYING DIMENSIONS\nFigure 2: The overview of DAB\nmodule.\nA DAB can encode\nand decode inputs and outputs\nof varying dimensions.\nGiven our assumption that all the tasks may have varying input\nand output dimensions, we write Dj = {dj,k}nj\nk=1 where xj,k :=\n[x1\nj,k . . . xu(j)\nj,k ] ∈Ru(j) and yj,k := [y1\nj,k . . . y(v(j)\nj,k\n] ∈Rv(j).\nGiven the context Dj,c, the equation for the predictive density\np(Yj|Xj, Dj,c) remains the same with Eq. 2. However, due to\nthe varying dimensions, the computation of both the likelihood\nNj,k and the context representation posterior p(rj|Dj,c) poses\na challenge. In a fixed dimension setting, only the size of the\ncontext varies across different tasks, and this could be processed\nby choosing fenc as a permutation-invariant set functions (Zaheer\net al., 2017). However, in our scenario, for two different tasks τ1\nand τ2, a single encoder should compute,\nfenc(D1,c; ϕ) = fenc({((x1\n1,k, . . . , xu(1)\n1,k ), (y1\n1,k, . . . , yv(1)\n1,k ))}k∈c1; ϕ),\n(7)\nfenc(D2,c; ϕ) = fenc({((x1\n2,k, . . . , xu(2)\n2,k ), (y1\n2,k, . . . , yv(2)\n2,k ))}k∈c2; ϕ).\n(8)\nThe existing permutation-invariant encoder can process when\n|c1| ̸= |c2|, it cannot handle when (u(1), v(1)) ̸= (u(2), v(2)),\nbecause this disparity happens at the lowest level of the encoder,\ntypically implemented with a normal feed-forward neural network.\nThe standard architecture in the previous NP models is to employ\na Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) taking the concatenated inputs,\nfor instance,\nfenc(Dj,c; ϕ) =\n1\n|cj|\nX\nk∈cj\nMLP(concat(xj,k, yj,k)),\n(9)\nand the MLP encoder can only process fixed-dimensional inputs. A similar challenge also applies to\nthe decoder fdec computing the predictive mean µrj(xj,k) and variance σ2\nrj(xj,k). To address this\nchallenge, we need a new neural network that is capable of handling sets of varying dimensions.\n3.2\nDIMENSION AGGREGATOR BLOCK\nTo enable our model to process sets with elements of varying dimensions, we introduce a module\ncalled Dimension Aggregator Block (DAB). The module can encode inputs with varying feature\ndimensions into a fixed-dimensional representation and varying dimensional representations, which\nwe will describe individually below. The overall architecture is depicted in Fig. 2.\nEncoding x into a fixed dimensional representation.\nConsider an input (x, y) where x =\n[x1 . . . xdx] ∈Rdx and y = [y1 . . . ydy] ∈Rdy. To maintain sufficient information for each\ndimension of the input data, even after it has been mapped to a fixed-dimensional representation, we\ninitially expand each of the dx + dy dimensions of the input data to dr dimensions using learnable\nlinear projection w ∈Rdr as follows:\n[˜x, ˜y] = w[concat(x, y)]⊤∈Rdr×(dx+dy).\n(10)\nWhen encoding a point in the target set Dj,t without the label y, we simply encode the zero-padded\nvalue concat(x, 0). Next, following Vaswani et al. (2017), we incorporate cosine and sine positional\nencoding to distinguish and retain positional information for each input dimension as follows:\nPEX(2i,j) = sin(j/P(i)), PEX(2i+1,j) = cos(j/P(i)),\n(11)\nPEY(2i,l) = cos(l/P(i)), PEY(2i+1,l) = sin(l/P(i)),\n(12)\nwhere P(i) = 100002i/dr and PEX, PEY represent the positional encoding for x and y respectively.\nHere, j ∈[dx] and l ∈[dy] respectively denote the position indices of ˜x and ˜y, while i ∈⌊dr\n2 ⌋\n4\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nrepresents a dimension in the representation space. Since the dimensions of both x and y vary and\nthe representation must be divided between corresponding positions in x and y, e.g., x1 and y1, we\nuse distinct positional embeddings, PEX for x and PEY for y. After adding positional encoding to\n(˜x, ˜y), we further compute,\n(˜x, ˜y) = SelfAttn(concat(˜x, ˜y) + (PEX, PEY)),\n(13)\nwhere SelfAttn indicates a self-attention layer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Here, we can regard (˜x, ˜y)\nbefore the self-attention layer as akin to context-free embeddings (Rong, 2014), because they remain\nunchanged when position and value are fixed. Conversely, (˜x, ˜y) after the Self-Attention layer can\nbe likened to contextual embeddings (Devlin et al., 2018), which is known as advanced embedding\ncompared to context-free embedding, as the final representation may vary depending on alterations\nin value and position across other dimensions due to the interaction through the self-attention layer.\nThen, we employ average pooling for the ˜x to integrate all the information across varying dimensions\nin x into a fixed-dimensional representation, i.e., ˆx = AvgPool(˜x) ∈Rdr, with AvgPool representing\nthe average pooling operation across the feature dimension.\nHandling variable number of outputs for y.\nThe DAB should produce representations that can be\nused in the decoder later to produce outputs with varying dimensions. To achieve this, unlike for the\nx, we keep the sequence ˜y without average pooling. Instead, for each ℓ= 1, . . . , dy, we concatenate\nˆx and ˜yl and put into the decoder to get the predictive mean and variances. The dimension of the\nencoding for y from the DAB would be the same as original dimension of y. Note that this is not like\nthe sequential decoding in autoregressive models, and is possible because we know the dimension of\ny before we actually have to decode the representation.\n3.3\nLEARNING MORE GENERAL FEATURE UTILIZING LATENT PATH\nLet ˜Dj := (ˆxj,k, (˜yl\nj,k)v(j)\nl=1 )nj\nk=1 be the representations obtained by DAB for the dataset Dj. The\nnext step involves computing the predictive density using the encoder and decoder structure. Here,\nwe employ TNP (Nguyen & Grover, 2022), a variant of CNPs, as our base model structure. In TNP,\nMasked Transformer layers are utilized as the encoder for the deterministic path, while a simple MLP\nstructure serves as the decoder. To improve the model’s capacity to learn generally shared features\nacross various tasks and effectively capture functional uncertainty, we introduce a new latent path\ncomprising Transformer layers and a Self-Attention layer alongside the single deterministic path\nencoder. In specific, we pass the entire ˜Dj into Masked Transformer layers to make deterministic\nparameter rdet\nj\nas follows:\nzl\nj,k = concat(ˆxj,k, ˜yl\nj,k) ∈R2dr,\n(14)\nrdet\nj\n= MTFL(concat({{zl\nj,k}v(j)\nl=1 }nj\nk=1), Mj) ∈Rv(j)nj×2dr,\n(15)\nwhere MTFL denotes Masked Transformer layers with mask Mj, and concat({{zl\nj,k}v(j)\nl=1 }nj\nk=1)\nindicate concatenation operation which concatenate zl\nj,k for all l ∈[v(j)] and k ∈[nj]. In this\ncontext, for all l1, l2 ∈[v(j)], the mask Mj ∈Rv(j)nj×v(j)nj assigns a value of 1 to the index\n(l1k1, l2k2) if both k1 and k2 are elements of cj, or if k1 is in tj and k2 is in cj; otherwise, it assigns\na value of 0.\nFor the latent path, we only pass context set ˜Dj,c through Transformer layers, followed by one\nself-attention and MLP operation to determine the latent parameter rlat\nj as follows:\n¯rlat\nj = AvgPool(SelfAttn(TL(concat({{zl\nj,k}v(j)\nl=1 }k∈cj))),\n(16)\n(mDj,c, s2\nDj,c) = MLP(¯rlat\nj ),\n(17)\nrlat\nj ∼q(rlat\nj | ˜Dj,c) = N(rlat\nj |mDj,c, diag(s2\nDj,c)),\n(18)\nwhere TL denotes Transformer layers. Finally, we concatenate the deterministic parameter rdet\nj\nand\nlatent parameter rlat\nj to make the final parameter rj before forwarding them to the decoder module.\nThen, by utilizing a variational posterior with the latent path, our training objective transforms into\nEτj[log p(Yj|Xj, Dj,c)] ≥Eτj\n\nX\nk∈[nj]\nEq(rlat\nj |Dj) [log Nj,k] −KL[qj∥qj,c]\n\n,\n(19)\n5\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nwhere qj and qj,c denotes q(rlat\nj |Dj) and q(rlat\nj |Dj,c), respectively. Refer to Fig. 1 to observe the\ncontrast in the architecture between TNP and DANP.\n4\nRELATED WORKS\nNeural Processes\nThe first NPs model, called CNP (Garnelo et al., 2018a), utilized straightforward\nMLP layers for both its encoder and decoder. Similarly, NP (Garnelo et al., 2018b) adopted MLP\nlayers but introduced a global latent variable to capture model uncertainty, marking an early attempt\nto address uncertainty in NP frameworks. Conditional Attentive Neural Process (CANP) and Attentive\nNeural Process (ANP) (Kim et al., 2018) are notable for incorporating attention mechanisms within\nthe encoder, enhancing the summarization of context information relevant to target points. Building\non these ideas, TNP (Nguyen & Grover, 2022) employs masked transformer layers in its encoder,\ndelivering state-of-the-art performance among NPs across multiple tasks. Louizos et al. (2019)\nintroduced a variant that used local latent variables instead of a global latent variable to improve\nthe model’s ability to capture uncertainty. Following this, Bootstrapping Attentive Neural Process\n(BANP) (Lee et al., 2020) proposed the residual bootstrap method (Efron, 1992), making NPs more\nrobust to model misspecification. Lastly, Martingale Posterior Attentive Neural Process (MPANP) (Lee\net al., 2023) addressed model uncertainty with the martingale posterior (Fong et al., 2021), offering a\nmodern alternative to traditional Bayesian inference methods. Refer to Appendix B to see a more\ndetailed review of previous Neural Processes works.\nNeural Diffusion Process\nSimilar to DANP, there are prior works (Liu et al., 2020; Kossen et al.,\n2021; Dutordoir et al., 2023) that utilize bi-dimensional attention blocks to facilitate more informative\ndata feature updates or to ensure the permutation invariance property both at the data-instance level\nand the dimension level. Specifically, Neural Diffusion Process (NDP) (Dutordoir et al., 2023)\nemploys bi-dimensional attention blocks to guarantee permutation invariance both at the data and\ndimension levels, naturally leading to dimension-agnostic properties. However, NDP has a structural\nlimitation in that it is only partially dimension-agnostic for x when y = 1, and is not dimension-\nagnostic for other combinations. This makes it difficult to use as a general regressor. Additionally,\nthe use of diffusion-based sampling to approximate the predictive distribution leads to significantly\nhigh computational costs during inference and results in limited likelihood performance. Refer to\nAppendix D.1 to see the empirical comparison between DANP and NDP.\n5\nEXPERIMENTS\nIn this section, we carry out a series of experiments to empirically showcase the efficacy of DANP\nacross different situations, especially in various regression tasks and Bayesian Optimization task. To\nestablish a robust experimental foundation, we employ five distinct variations of NP, encompassing\nstate-of-the-art model: CANP, ANP, BANP, MPANP, and TNP. For a fair comparison, we maintain\nan identical latent sample size in the latent path across all models, except for deterministic models\nsuch as CANP and TNP. We marked the best performance value with boldfaced underline, and the\nsecond-best value with underline in each column in all tables. All the performance metrics are\naveraged over three different seeds and we report 1-sigma error bars for all experiments. Refer to\nAppendix C for experimental details containing data description and model structures.\n5.1\nGP REGRESSION\nTo empirically verify the effectiveness of DANP, we initially conducted GP regression experiments\nunder various conditions: From-scratch, Zero-shot, and Fine-tuning. In the From-scratch scenario,\nwe compared DANP against other baselines using fixed input dimensional GP data for both training\nand testing. In the Zero-shot scenario, we demonstrated the ability of DANP to generalize to different\ndimensional input GP data without direct training on that data. Lastly, in the Fine-tuning scenario, we\nconducted experiments where we fine-tuned on unseen dimensional GP data, using limited training\ndata points, utilizing pre-trained DANP alongside other baseline models.\nFrom-scratch\nTo validate the capability of DANP to effectively learn generally shared features and\ncapture functional uncertainty across tasks, we first compare DANP against other baseline models in the\n6\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n2\n1\n0\n1\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\nZero-shot\nground truth\ncontext points\nFull Img\nContext\nMean\nStd\nFigure 3: Posterior samples of DANP in (Left) the Zero-shot scenario with a 1-dimensional GP\ndataset and (Right) the Image completion task using the EMNIST and CelebA datasets.

In this experiment, the meta-\ntraining datasets are produced using GP under four distinct configurations: either one-dimensional\nor two-dimensional input, utilizing either the RBF or Matern kernels. The results presented in\nTable 1 demonstrate that DANP consistently surpasses other baseline models across various settings,\nparticularly excelling on the target dataset in terms of log-likelihood. These results prove that DANP\neffectively grasps common features and captures functional uncertainty, outperforming other baseline\nmodels even with various settings in fixed-dimensional GP regression tasks.\nZero-shot\nIn the Zero-shot scenario, we train a single NP model using various dimensional GP\ndatasets and then evaluate the performance of the model on a range of GP datasets with different\ndimensions. Specifically, we consider two different cases: one where the training datasets include 2\nand 4-dimensional GP datasets, and another where the training datasets include 2, 3, and 4-dimensional\nGP datasets. After training, we assess our pre-trained model on GP datasets ranging from 1 to 5 and\n7 dimensions. We validate results for our model as DANP, in distinction from other baselines, is\ncapable of simultaneously training on and inferring from datasets with diverse dimensions. Table 2a\ndemonstrates that DANP successfully learns the shared features across different dimensional GP\ndatasets and generalizes effectively to test datasets with the same dimensions as the training datasets.\nRemarkably, DANP also generalizes well to test datasets with previously unseen dimensions. For\ninstance, the zero-shot log-likelihood for the 1-dimensional GP dataset, when DANP is trained on 2, 3,\nand 4-dimensional datasets, is nearly comparable to the log-likelihood of CANP with From-scratch\ntraining in Table 1. These findings suggest that DANP efficiently captures and learns general features\nacross various tasks, allowing it to explain tasks with unseen dimensions without additional training.\nFor further results using 2 and 3-dimensional GP datasets or different kernels during training, see\nAppendix D. The trends are consistent, showing that DANP generalizes well across various tasks.\nRefer to Fig. 3 to see the zero-shot posterior samples for the 1-dimensional GP regression task. And\nalso refer to Appendix D.2.3 to see the results on the additional zero-shot scenarios, especially\nextrapolation scenarios.\nFine-tuning\nIn the fine-tuning scenario, we fine-tuned pre-trained NP models on a limited set of\n160 1-dimensional GP regression tasks. For the baselines, we used pre-trained models that were\ntrained on 2-dimensional tasks as described in the From-scratch experiments. For DANP, we used\nmodels pre-trained on 2, 3, and 4-dimensional tasks as mentioned in the Zero-shot experiments.

The results in Table 2b clearly show\nthat all the NP models, except for DANP, fail to achieve high generalization performance. Furthermore,\nthe performance of DANP shows a clear improvement over the zero-shot log-likelihood result in\nTable 2a following the fine-tuning with the limited data. This indicates that the features from the\npre-trained baselines are not effectively applied to unseen dimensional downstream datasets with a\nlimited amount of data. In contrast, DANP is able to generalize well on these unseen dimensional\ndownstream datasets with only a small amount of downstream data. Refer to Appendix D.2.4 to see\nthe results on additional fine-tuning scenarios.\n5.2\nIMAGE COMPLETION AND VIDEO COMPLETION\nImage Completion\nTo validate our model’s capability to meta-train implicit stochastic processes\nfor varying output dimensions, we perform image completion tasks on two different datasets: EM-\nNIST (Cohen et al., 2017) and CelebA (Liu et al., 2015). In these tasks, we randomly select some\npixels as context points and use NP models to predict the selected target pixels. Here, we use the\n2-dimensional position value as input and the channel value as output. Previous NP models were\nunable to formulate the predictive distribution for varying output dimensions, failing to learn image\ncompletion tasks with different numbers of channels. However, our DANP model can handle varying\noutput dimensions, allowing it to simultaneously learn various image completion tasks with different\nnumbers of channels. The experimental results for EMNIST and CelebA reported in Table 3 were\nmeasured using models trained separately for each dataset for the baselines, whereas ours were ob-\ntained using a single model trained simultaneously for both datasets. Table 3 demonstrates that DANP\nsuccessfully learns both image completion tasks, validating its ability to formulate the predictive\ndensity for outputs with varying dimensions. Refer to Fig. 3 and Appendix D for the visualizations of\npredicted mean and standard deviation of completed images.\nFine-tuning on Video Completion\nTo further validate the capability of utilizing pre-trained features\nin DANP for tasks with unseen dimensions, we created a simple video dataset based on the CelebA\ndataset. Specifically, we used the original CelebA data as the first frame at time t = 0 and gradually\ndecreased the brightness by subtracting 5 from each channel for each time t ∈[9]. This process\nresulted in an input dimension of 3, combining the time axis with position values. We fine-tuned pre-\ntrained NP models on only 5 video data, simulating a scenario with limited data for the downstream\ntask. For the baselines, we used models pre-trained on the CelebA dataset. For DANP, we used\n8\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n# BO steps\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\nNormalized Regret\n6-dim BO (Inter.)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n# BO steps\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n9-dim BO (Extra.)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n# BO steps\n0.020\n0.025\n0.030\n0.035\n0.040\n0.045\n0.050\n0.055\n10-dim BO (Extra.)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n# BO steps\n0.000\n0.005\n0.010\n0.015\n0.020\n0.025\n0.030\n16-dim BO (Extra.)\nANP\nCANP\nBANP\nMPANP\nTNP\nDANP\nFigure 4: Results for Bayesian Optimization (BO) on 6-, 9-, 10-, and 16-dimensional hyperparameter\ntuning tasks in the HPO-B benchmark.

Table 3b demonstrates that, while\nother baseline methods fail to generalize to the increased input dimensional dataset, our method\nsuccessfully learns and generalizes well with a scarce amount of training data. Refer to Appendix D\nfor the example of video data and the predicted mean and standard deviation.\n5.3\nBAYESIAN OPTIMIZATION FOR HYPERPARAMETER TUNING\nTo illustrate the real-world applicability of DANP, we conducted BO (Brochu et al., 2010) experiments\non 6, 9, 10, and 16-dimensional hyperparameter tuning tasks in HPO-B (Pineda-Arango et al., 2021)\nbenchmark. HPO-B is a large-scale black-box hyperparameter optimization benchmark, which is\nassembled and preprocessed from the OpenML repository with 8 different hyperparameter dimensions\n(2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 16, and 18-dim) and evaluated sparsely on 196 datasets with a total of 6.4 million\nhyperparameter evaluations. We target 6, 9, 10, and 16-dimensional hyperparameter tuning tasks.\nTo do so, we pre-trained baselines on the 2-dimensional tasks in the meta-train split of the HPO-B\nbenchmark and then fine-tune the baselines on a limited set of 4 meta-batches sampled from each\ntarget task. In contrast, for DANP, we follow the zero-shot setting, where we use a single model\npre-trained on 2, 3, and 8-dimensional tasks in the meta-train split without fine-tuning on target tasks.\nPlease see more detailed setups in Appendix C.7. We use Expected Improvement (Jones et al., 1998)\nas an acquisition function for all experiments and measured performance using normalized regret,\nymax−y\nymax−ymin , where ymax and ymin denotes the global best and worst value, respectively. We run 200\niterations for all the BO experiments and report the average and standard deviation of normalized\nregrets over 10 different random seeds. The results in Fig. 4 demonstrate that DANP outperforms other\nbaselines in terms of regret with the same iteration numbers. This demonstrates that DANP is capable\nof serving as a surrogate model for different BO-based hyperparameter tuning tasks using only a single\nmodel without additional training on new BO tasks, and it also effectively learns generalized shared\nfeatures across a wide range of tasks. Surprisingly, the gap between DANP and baselines is even\nlarger for the dimension extrapolation settings (9, 10, 16-dim), which empirically validates that the\nDANP is capable of handling unseen, varying-dimensional data, including cases where extrapolation\nis required. Refer to Appendix D.10 to see the results on synthetic BO tasks. The trends are similar.\n5.4\nABLATION STUDY\nTo analyze the roles of each module in DANP through ablation experiments, we conducted a series\nof ablation experiments on various modules. The ablation experiments were categorized into three\nmain parts: 1) the roles of the DAB module and Latent path, 2) the role of positional encoding in\nthe DAB module, and 3) experiments replacing mean pooling with attention-based averaging in the\n9\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nDAB module. The experiments were conducted on 1D GP regression, 2D GP regression, and image\ncompletion tasks. In Table 4, we analyze the log-likelihood results only for the target, excluding the\ncontext. For the full results, including the context, please refer to Appendix D.3. It can be observed\nthat the context exhibits similar trends to the target.\nThe Role of the DAB Module and Latent Path\nAs mentioned in Section 3.2 and Section 3.3, the\nDAB module is used as a module for handling varying dimensional input, and the latent path is added\nto capture more accurate model uncertainty, thereby improving model performance and increasing\nthe capacity to learn generally shared features among tasks. Table 4 show that the performance trends\nalign well with the direction we described and intended in the Section 3. In Table 4, the DAB and\nLatent rows show the performance when DAB and Latent paths are added to TNP, respectively. We\ncan observe that in all data and experiments, adding only the DAB to TNP results in a performance\nclose to TNP, while adding the latent path results in a performance closer to DANP. This demonstrates\nthat adding only the DAB module allows for the handling of varying dimensional data, but there\nare limitations in improving model performance. However, adding the latent path improves model\nperformance but still has the issue of not being able to handle varying dimensional data.\nThe Role of Positional Encoding in the DAB Module\nWhen treating the diverse dimensional\ntasks, permuting the orders of the features should not affect the result, but note that the permutation\nshould apply simultaneously for all inputs. For instance, for a model having three features, say we\npermute the features to (3,1,2) for the first input and (1,3,2) for the second input. Then there is no\nway for the model to distinguish different feature values. Removing positional embeddings from the\nDAB is effectively doing this; since we treat all the features as elements in a set, it allows different\npermutations applied for different inputs, so the model does not distinguish different features.\nWe’ve tested the necessity of positional encoding through additional experiments, which confirmed\nits importance. In Table 4, “Pos” indicates the case when we extract the positional encoding from the\nDAB module. For the 1D GP regression tasks, because there is only one dimension for the input x,\nthe existence of positional encoding does not affect the final performance. However, as seen in 2D\nregression tasks and image completion tasks, the existence of positional encoding is crucial for the\nfinal performance. Refer to Appendices D.5 to D.7 to see additional ablation results using Rotary\nPosition Embedding (RoPE; Touvron et al., 2023).\nAttention-based averaging\nTo verify if the mean pooling in the DAB module can be enhanced by\nusing attention-based averaging, we employed the Pooling by Multihead Attention (PMA; Lee et al.,\n2019) module. This module uses a learnable token that is updated through cross-attention layers\nby pooling the input tokens using attention. In Table 4, the PMA row shows the results when mean\npooling in the DAB is replaced with the PMA module. The results consistently indicate that mean\npooling and attention-based averaging yield similar performance across nearly all tasks. Refer to\nAppendix D to see extensive additional empirical analysis and additional experiments.\n6\nCONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we present a novel NP variant that addresses the limitations of previous NP variants\nby incorporating a DAB block and a Transformer-based latent path. Our approach offers two key\nadvantages: 1) the ability to directly handle diverse input and output dimensions, and 2) the capacity\nfor learned features to be fine-tuned on new tasks with varying input and output dimensions. We\nempirically validate DANP across various tasks and scenarios, consistently demonstrating superior\nperformance compared to the baselines. Conducting various experiments only with a single model\ncan be a starting point for the utilization of NP models as general regressors for a wide range of\nregression tasks.\nLimitation and Future work\nIn this study, DANP concentrated on the regression task, but it can\nnaturally be extended to other tasks, such as classification. A promising direction for future work\nwould be to pre-train the encoder, which includes the DAB module to handle diverse dimensional data,\nusing various datasets from different tasks and then fine-tuning with a small amount of downstream\ndata for various tasks using appropriate decoders.\n10\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nReproducibility Statement.\nWe provide the architecture of our proposed model along with the\narchitectures of other baseline models in Appendix C.1. Additionally, the hyperparameters used in the\nexperiments, metrics, and detailed information about the data utilized in each experiment are described\nin Appendix C.

We view the DANP research as the initial step toward achieving this\nambitious objective.\nA key focus of this future work direction will be to extend the model’s ability to appropriately process\ninputs with varying dimensions, numbers of context and target points, and diverse data structures\n(for example there can be lots of different tasks with the same dimensional inputs such as EMNIST\nimage completion and 2d GP regression task). Developing a model that can flexibly adapt to such\nvariability without specific data processing based on inductive bias while providing accurate and\nreliable inferences across these scenarios remains a critical challenge and an exciting direction for\nfurther exploration.\nB\nADDITIONAL RELATED WORKS\nThe first Neural Process (NP) model, the Conditional Neural Process (CNP) (Garnelo et al., 2018a),\nutilized straightforward MLP layers for both the encoder and decoder. Neural Process (NP) (Garnelo\net al., 2018b) extended this by incorporating a global latent variable to capture model uncertainty.\nEnhancements followed with Attentive Neural Processes (ANP) (Kim et al., 2018) and Conditional\nAttentive Neural Processes (CANP), which introduced attention mechanisms in the encoder for better\ncontext summarization. Transformer Neural Processes (TNP) (Nguyen & Grover, 2022) replaced\nMLPs with masked transformer layers, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\nFurther advancements include Functional Neural Processes (Louizos et al., 2019), which employed\nlocal latent variables to improve uncertainty capture, and Bootstrapping Attentive Neural Processes\n(BANP) (Lee et al., 2020), which utilized a residual bootstrap approach to address model misspec-\nification. Martingale Posterior Attentive Neural Processes (MPANP) (Lee et al., 2023) addressed\nuncertainty with the martingale posterior, offering a Bayesian alternative.\nRecent developments have expanded NPs’ scalability and expressiveness. For example, Translation\nEquivariant Transformer Neural Processes (TE-TNP) (Ashman et al., 2024) enhance spatio-temporal\nmodeling with translation equivariance, which leverages symmetries in posterior predictive maps\ncommon in stationary data. Latent Bottlenecked Attentive Neural Processes (LBANP) (Feng et al.,\n2022a) and Mixture of Expert Neural Processes (MoE-NPs) (Wang & Van Hoof, 2022) improve latent\nvariable modeling through bottlenecks and dynamic mixtures, improving computational efficiency\nand generalization across various meta-learning tasks. Autoregressive Conditional Neural Processes\n(AR CNPs) (Bruinsma et al., 2023) address temporal dependencies by autoregressively defining a joint\npredictive distribution, while Self-normalized Importance weighted Neural Process (SI-NP) (Wang\net al., 2023) refine inference through iterative optimization.\nOther contributions include Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes (CMANPs) (Feng et al.,\n2023), which reduce memory usage with constant memory attention blocks, and Gaussian Neural\nProcesses (GNPs) (Markou et al., 2022), focusing on tractable dependent predictions by modeling the\ncovariance matrix of a Gaussian predictive process. Efficient Queries Transformer Neural Processes\n(EQTNPs) (Feng et al., 2022b) improve TNPs by applying self-attention only to the context points,\nretrieving information for target points through cross-attention. Together, these advancements address\nkey limitations in uncertainty modeling, inference, and computational efficiency, forming the basis\nfor further progress in NP research.\nC\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nTo ensure reproducibility, we have included our experiment code in the supplementary material.\nOur code builds upon the official implementation1 of TNP (Nguyen & Grover, 2022). We utilize\nPyTorch (Ansel et al., 2024) for all experiments, and BayesO (Kim & Choi, 2023), BoTorch (Balandat\n1https://github.com/tung-nd/TNP-pytorch.git\n15\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\net al., 2020), and GPyTorch (Gardner et al., 2018) packages for Bayesian Optimization experiments.\nAll experiments were conducted on either a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU or an NVIDIA\nRTX A6000 GPU. For optimization, we used the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with cosine\nlearning rate scheduler. Unless otherwise specified, we selected the base learning rate, weight decay,\nand batch size from the following grids: {5×10−5, 7×10−5, 9×10−5, 1×10−4, 3×10−4, 5×10−4}\nfor learning rate, {0, 1 × 10−5} for weight decay, and {16, 32} for batch size, based on validation\ntask log-likelihood.\nC.1\nDETAILS OF MODEL STRUCTURES\nTable 5: Model structure details of CANP\nCATEGORY\nDETAILS\nMODEL SPECIFICATIONS\nDETERMINISTIC PATH HIDDEN DIMENSION\n128\nMLP DEPTH FOR VALUE IN CROSS ATTENTION LAYER\n4\nMLP DEPTH FOR KEY AND QUERY IN CROSS ATTENTION LAYER\n2\nMLP DEPTH FOR SELF-ATTENTION INPUT LAYER\n4\nMLP DEPTH FOR SELF-ATTENTION OUTPUT LAYER\n2\nDECODER DEPTH\n3\nNUMBER OF PARAMETERS FOR 1D GP REGRESSION\n331906\nTable 6: Model structure details of ANP\nCATEGORY\nDETAILS\nMODEL SPECIFICATIONS\nDETERMINISTIC PATH HIDDEN DIMENSION\n128\nLATENT PATH HIDDEN DIMENSION\n128\nMLP DEPTH FOR VALUE IN CROSS ATTENTION LAYER\n4\nMLP DEPTH FOR KEY AND QUERY IN CROSS ATTENTION LAYER\n2\nMLP DEPTH FOR SELF-ATTENTION INPUT LAYER\n4\nMLP DEPTH FOR SELF-ATTENTION OUTPUT LAYER\n2\nDECODER DEPTH\n3\nNUMBER OF PARAMETERS FOR 1D GP REGRESSION\n348418\nIn this section, we summarize the structural details of CANP, ANP, BANP, MPANP, TNP, and DANP.\nIt is important to note that while we report the number of parameters for the baseline models in\na 1-dimensional GP regression scenario, their parameter counts increase as the input and output\ndimensions increase. In contrast, the number of parameters in our model remains constant regardless\nof the input and output dimension combinations. This proves that our model is structurally efficient\ncompared to other baseline models. Also, following Lee et al. (2023), we model MPANP without the\nSelf-Attention layer in the deterministic path.\n16\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nTable 7: Model structure details of BANP\nCATEGORY\nDETAILS\nMODEL SPECIFICATIONS\nDETERMINISTIC PATH HIDDEN DIMENSION\n128\nMLP DEPTH FOR VALUE IN CROSS ATTENTION LAYER\n4\nMLP DEPTH FOR KEY AND QUERY IN CROSS ATTENTION LAYER\n2\nMLP DEPTH FOR SELF-ATTENTION INPUT LAYER\n4\nMLP DEPTH FOR SELF-ATTENTION OUTPUT LAYER\n2\nDECODER DEPTH\n3\nNUMBER OF PARAMETERS FOR 1D GP REGRESSION\n364674\nTable 8: Model structure details of MPANP\nCATEGORY\nDETAILS\nMODEL SPECIFICATIONS\nDETERMINISTIC PATH HIDDEN DIMENSION\n128\nHIDDEN DIMENSION FOR EXCHANGEABLE GENERATIVE MODEL\n128\nDEPTH FOR EXCHANGEABLE GENERATIVE MODEL\n1\nMLP DEPTH FOR VALUE IN CROSS ATTENTION LAYER\n4\nMLP DEPTH FOR KEY AND QUERY IN CROSS ATTENTION LAYER\n2\nMLP DEPTH FOR SELF-ATTENTION INPUT LAYER\n4\nMLP DEPTH FOR SELF-ATTENTION OUTPUT LAYER\n2\nDECODER DEPTH\n3\nNUMBER OF PARAMETERS FOR 1D GP REGRESSION\n892418\nC.2\nEVALUATION METRIC FOR THE TASKS\nFollowing Le et al.

Specifically, we first determine the number of context points |c| by drawing from a\nuniform distribution Unif(n2 × 5, n2 × 50 −n2 × 5). The interval for this uniform distribution\nis scaled by n2 to ensure that as the input dimension increases, the number of context points also\nincreases, which is necessary for constructing an accurate predictive density for the target points.\nNext, we sample the number of target points |t| from a uniform distribution Unif(n2×5, n2×50−|c|)\nto keep the total number of points within a manageable range. After determining the number of\n18\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\ncontext and target points, we sample the input x for each context and target point from the uniform\ndistribution Unif(−2, 2) independently for each dimension i in [n].\nWe then generate the outputs y using the corresponding kernel functions. We employ the RBF\nkernel k(x, x′) = s2 exp\n\u0010\n−||x−x′||2\n2ℓ2\n\u0011\nand the Matern 5/2 kernel k(x, x′) = s2 \u0010\n1 +\n√\n5d\nℓ\n+ 5d2\n3ℓ2\n\u0011\n,\nwhere d = ||x −x′||. For these kernels, the parameters are sampled as follows: s ∼Unif(0.1, 1.0),\nℓ∼Unif(0.1, 0.6), and p ∼Unif(0.1, 0.5).\nC.4\nEMNIST DATASET\nWe employed the EMNIST 2 Balanced dataset (Cohen et al., 2017), which consists of 112,800\ntraining samples and 18,800 test samples. This dataset encompasses 47 distinct classes, from which\nwe selected 11 classes for our use. Consequently, our training and test datasets comprise 26,400 and\n4,400 samples, respectively. Each image is represented by a 28 × 28 grid with a single channel. We\nmapped the pixel coordinates to a range from -0.5 to 0.5 and normalized the pixel values to lie within\n[-0.5, 0.5]. We sample the number of context points |c| ∼Unif(5, 45) and the number of target points\n|t| ∼Unif(5, 50 −|c|).\nC.5\nCELEBA DATASET\nWe utilized the CelebA 3 dataset (Liu et al., 2015), which includes 162,770 training samples, 19,867\nvalidation samples, and 19,962 test samples. The images were center-cropped to 32x32 pixels,\nresulting in a 32 × 32 grid with 3 RGB channels. As with the EMNIST dataset, we scaled the\npixel coordinates to a range of -0.5 to 0.5 and normalized each pixel value within [-0.5, 0.5]. We\nsampled the number of context points |c| from Unif(5, 45) and the number of target points |t| from\nUnif(5, 50 −|c|).\nC.6\nCELEBA VIDEO DATASET\nFor the CelebA Video dataset, we generated a simple video dataset using the CelebA image dataset.\nSpecifically, after normalizing the pixel coordinates and values according to the pre-processing steps\nfor the CelebA dataset, we set the original CelebA data as the initial frame at time t = 0. We then\ngradually decreased the brightness by subtracting 5/255 from each channel for each time step t ∈[9],\nconcatenating each generated image to the previous ones. This resulted in a simple video with a\n32 × 32 grid, 3 RGB channels, and 10 frames. Consequently, the input dimension was 3, combining\nthe time axis with pixel coordinates. As with the CelebA dataset, we sampled the number of context\npoints |c| from Unif(5, 45) and the number of target points |t| from Unif(5, 50 −|c|).\nC.7\nBAYESIAN OPTIMIZATION\nExcept for the BO experiments on HPO-B benchmark, we adjust the objective function to have the\ndomain of [−2.0, 2.0]. We evaluated our method using various benchmark datasets and real-world\nscenarios. Below, we provide details of these experiments.\nHyperparameter Tuning on HPO-B benchmark\nWe utility the HPO-B benchmark (Pineda-\nArango et al., 2021), which consists of 176 search spaces (algorithms) evaluated sparsely on 196\ndatasets with a total of 6.4 million hyperparameter evaluations. In this benchmark, the continuous\nhyperparameters normalized in [0, 1], and the categorical hyperparameters are one-hot encoded.\nWe use all the search space except for the 18-dimensional space, i.e., 2-, 3-, 6-, 8-, 9-, 10-, and\n16-dimensional search spaces are used for the experiments. To construct meta-batch from each task,\nwe sample the number of context points |c| from Unif(5, 50) and the number of target points |t| from\nUnif(5, 50 −|c|); therefore, we exclude tasks which lesser than 100 (= 50 + 50) hyperparameter\nevaluations. For baselines, we first pre-train them on all the tasks collected from all the 2-dimensional\nsearch spaces of meta-train split. We then fine-tune them on 4 meta-batches randomly sampled from\neach target task (6-, 9-, 10-, 16-dim). To prevent an overfitting on the limited data, we early-stop the\n2https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset\n3https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html\n19\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\ntraining with respect to the likelihood on meta-validation split of target task. For DANP, we pre-train\nit on all the tasks collected from 2-, 3-, and 8-dimensional search spaces of meta-train split. We then\nevaluate it without fine-tuning on target tasks, which corresponds to zero-shot setting. For BO, we\nrun 200 iterations for each hyperparameter tuning task in meta-test split; therefore, we exclude tasks\nwhich have lesser than 210 hyperparameter evaluations. Furthermore, the order of hyperparameter\ndimensions is randomly shuffled to make the task diverse.\n1 dimensional BO with GP generated objective functions\nTo evaluate basic BO performance when\nusing each model as a surrogate for the black-box objective function, we first create an oracle sample\nusing a GP with an RBF kernel and evaluate how well each model approximates these samples. We\nconducted 1D BO for 100 iterations across 100 tasks using the expected improvement acquisition\nfunction.\n2 and 3 dimensional BO benchmarks\nWe utilize three benchmark objective functions:\nAckley (Back, 1996) function\nf(x) = −a exp\n\u0012\n−b\nv\nu\nu\nt1\nd\nd\nX\ni=1\nx2\ni\n\u0013\n−exp\n\u00121\nd\nd\nX\ni=1\ncos(cxi)\n\u0013\n+ a + exp(1)\n(22)\nwhere xi ∈[−32.768, 32.768], for all i = 1, · · · , d and global minimum is x∗≈(0, · · · , 0).\nCosine function\nf(x) =\nd\nX\ni=1\ncos(xi)\n\u00120.1\n2π |xi| −1\n\u0013\n(23)\nwhere xi ∈[−2π, 2π], for all i = 1, · · · , d and global minimum is x∗≈(0, · · · , 0).\nRastrigin (Rastrigin, 1974) function\nf(x) = 10d +\nd\nX\ni=1\n[x2\ni −10 cos(2πxi)]\n(24)\nwhere xi ∈[−5.12, 5.12], for all i = 1, · · · , d and global minimum is x∗≈(0, · · · , 0).\nTo evaluate the models in multi-dimensional scenarios, we conduct experiments with cases\nof d = 1 and d = 2 for all the aforementioned benchmark functions. We perform evaluations over\n100 iterations for each of the 100 tasks, utilizing the expected improvement acquisition function.\nCNN BO\nFor evaluation in a real-world BO scenario, we utilized the CIFAR-10 dataset (Krizhevsky\net al., 2009) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (LeCun et al., 1989). The CIFAR-10 dataset\nconsists of 50,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples across 10 classes. In this setting, we\ngenerated 1,000 samples by creating combinations of weight decay, learning rate, and batch size,\nand trained the model for 20 epochs using the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015). The range for\neach hyperparameter is [1e −05, 1e −01] for learning rate, [1e −04, 1e −01] for weight decay, and\n[128, 256] for batch size, with 10 values selected uniformly within each range. These 1,000 samples\nwere pre-generated, and we evaluated each BO task with 1 initial sample and conducted 50 iterations\nfor each of the 10 tasks using the expected improvement acquisition function.\nD\nADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS\nD.1\nCOMPARISON BETWEEN NEURAL DIFFUSION PROCESS AND DIMENSION AGNOSTIC\nNEURAL PROCESSES\nAs we discussed in Section 4, NDP has two major issues: 1) it has a structural limitation, being only\npartially dimension-agnostic for x when y = 1, and not dimension-agnostic for other combinations,\nand 2) its reliance on diffusion-based sampling to approximate the predictive distribution results in\n20\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nTable 11: Additional results of the context and target log-likelihood for the GP regression task in the\nFrom-scratch scenario on NDP and DANP.\nModel\n1D RBF\n1D Matern\n2D RBF\n2D Matern\ncontext\ntarget\ncontext\ntarget\ncontext\ntarget\ncontext\ntarget\nNDP\n5.914 ±0.097\n-0.376 ±0.077\n5.924 ±0.046\n-0.503 ±0.016\n5.945 ±0.044\n-0.570 ±0.006\n6.079 ±0.114\n-0.704 ±0.021\nDANP (ours)\n1.381 ±0.000\n0.921 ±0.003\n1.382 ±0.000\n0.723 ±0.003\n1.383 ±0.000\n0.373 ±0.001\n1.383 ±0.000\n0.068 ±0.001\nTable 12: Additional results of zero-shot scenario.

Table 11\nand Table 12 clearly show that while NDP outperforms DANP in terms of context likelihood, it\nsignificantly underperforms in target likelihood. This discrepancy arises because NDP relies on a\ndiffusion-based sampling method to generate possible outputs and then calculates the empirical\nposterior distribution from the gathered samples. This approach leads the model to predict the context\npoints with high accuracy and low variance, thus achieving high context likelihood. However, for\ntarget points, the model struggles to accurately predict the distribution, resulting in a lower target\nlikelihood. Moreover, in most of our tasks, it is more important to achieve high likelihood predictions\nfor unseen target points rather than focusing on the observed context points. Therefore, having a\nhigher target point likelihood is more crucial than having a high context likelihood. Specifically,\nas shown in Table 12, NDP struggles to simultaneously learn across diverse dimensional inputs,\ndemonstrating that it cannot function effectively as a general regressor for unseen dimensions.\nD.2\nGP REGRESSION TASK\nD.2.1\nOTHER METRICS\nTable 13: Additional evaluation of CRPS metric and confidence interval coverage on the 1D GP\nregression task with RBF kernel.

We have measured these metrics for the 1D and 2D GP regression tasks.\nFor the fair comparison, we used the checkpoints from the From-scratch experiment in Section 5.1\nfor all models. The results are presented in Table 13.\n21\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nFirst, regarding the confidence interval coverage, it is observed that the context confidence interval\ntends to be too wide for all models. This issue arises because Neural Process models set a minimum\nstandard deviation of 0.1 during inference to account for training stability and data noise. Additionally,\nthe value of 0.1 is simply a conventional choice when designing Neural Process models. Therefore,\nsetting this value lower during model construction can help ensure an appropriate confidence interval.\nOn the other hand, the target confidence interval tends to be relatively narrow, with the DANP model\nshowing the best results. Additionally, when looking at CRPS scores, it is clear that for context\npoints, the models generally perform at a similar level, but for target points, DANP shows better\nscores compared to the other models.\nTable 14: Results on additional metrics containing MAE, RMSE, R2, RMSCE, MACE, and MA on\n1d GP regression task.

Except for R2, lower values for all these metrics indicate better alignment with the target\nand improved calibration performance. We conducted the evaluation using models trained on a 1d\nGP regression task, comparing our method with the baselines. The results, summarized in Table 14,\ndemonstrate that DANP achieves the best performance across a range of metrics. This observation\nreaffirms that DANP not only outperforms in terms of NLL but also achieves improved performance\nin calibration-related metrics compared to the baselines.

Lastly, for\nthe third setting, we evaluated the model, trained on an RBF kernel, with an evaluation set generated\nusing a Matern 5/2 kernel.\nAs shown in Table 15, DANP clearly outperforms other baselines in both small and large context\nscenarios. Notably, DANP demonstrates superior performance compared to the other baselines in\nthe small context scenario, indicating its ability to accurately predict the predictive distribution with\na limited number of observations. Moreover, as illustrated in Table 16, DANP excels in both the\nincreased noise scale and differing kernel scenarios. These results confirm that DANP can effectively\nadapt to unseen tasks by learning generally shared features across different tasks.\nD.2.3\nADDITIONAL RESULTS FOR THE ZERO-SHOT SCENARIO\nIn the Zero-shot scenario for the GP regression task, we conducted two additional experiments\nutilizing DANP pre-trained with: 1) 2 and 3-dimensional GP datasets using the RBF kernel, and 2)\n2, 3, and 4-dimensional GP datasets using both RBF and Matern kernels. The log-likelihood results\nin Table 17 for the first experiment indicate that DANP can effectively predict the density of unseen\ndimensional GP datasets, though performance slightly declines for higher-dimensional datasets that\nare farther from the trained dimensions, as compared to the results in Table 2a. This demonstrates that\nwhile DANP can perform zero-shot inference on unseen dimensional datasets, training on a diverse\nrange of dimensions enhances predictive performance.\nIn the second experiment, the log-likelihood results show that DANP can be trained on diverse tasks\nwith different kernels.

By increasing the model\nsize to accommodate more features and additional structural layers, DANP can generalize to a wider\nvariety of tasks with different generating processes.\nD.2.4\nADDITIONAL RESULTS FOR THE FINE-TUNING SCENARIO WITH DIFFERENT KERNEL\nIn the Fine-tuning scenario for the GP regression task, we fine-tuned on 160 1-dimensional GP\nregression tasks using the Matern kernel. For baselines, we utilized pre-trained models that had been\ntrained on 2-dimensional GP regression tasks with the RBF kernel, as detailed in Section 5.1. For\nDANP, we used models pre-trained on 2, 3, and 4-dimensional GP regression tasks with the RBF\nkernel, also as described in Section 5.1. The results in Table 18 clearly demonstrate that while the\nbaselines fail to generalize, DANP can generalize to the 1-dimensional GP regression task with the\nMatern kernel almost as effectively as the From-scratch results in Table 1 with only a few datasets.\nThis indicates that DANP not only generalize well to unseen dimensional GP tasks with a known\nkernel but also to unseen dimensional GP tasks with an unknown kernel, compared to other baselines.\nD.3\nFULL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS FOR THE SECTION 5.4\nIn this subsection, we report the full log-likelihood results from the ablation study on both the context\nand target datasets. In Table 19, it can be easily observed that the context exhibits similar trends to\nthe target as we discussed in Section 5.4.\nD.4\nABLATION RESULTS ON DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES\nAs highlighted in Foong et al. (2020), the ELBO loss we used for DANP does not provide the exact\nELBO for the −log pθ(yt|xt, Dc), because we use q(θ|Dc) instead of p(θ|Dc). More precisely, the\nMaximum Likelihood Loss is a biased estimator of −log pθ(yt|xt, Dc), and the ELBO we used\nis a lower bound of the same quantity. Therefore, both losses still share the same issue, and the\neffectiveness of each loss depends on the model.\nTypically, the maximum likelihood loss tends to exhibit larger variance compared to variational\ninference, so, given our model’s need to handle multiple varying dimensional tasks simultaneously,\nwe opted for variational inference to ensure stability.

These experiments were performed in a\nzero-shot scenario by inferring on 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5d GP regression data. The results, presented in\nTable 20 and Table 21, show that while ML loss occasionally yields better log-likelihoods for context\npoints, the VI loss consistently provides superior performance for the target points, which are of\ngreater interest during inference. This trend is particularly evident in experiments trained on 2, 3, and\n4d GP data. These findings demonstrate that using the VI loss for training DANP is generally more\nbeneficial for improving generalization compared to the ML loss.\nD.5\nABLATION EXPERIMENTS ON POSITIONAL EMBEDDING IN DAB MODULE\nMany previous works have shown that sinusoidal positional encoding tends to perform poorly (Press\net al., 2021) in terms of generalization when extrapolating to longer sequence lengths for Large\nLanguage Models. In response to this, approaches like Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE; Touvron\net al., 2023; Su et al., 2024) have been proposed and used to address these limitations. While sinusoidal\npositional encoding successfully handled interpolation and extrapolation in our experimental settings,\nRoPE could potentially improve this performance. Therefore, we conducted additional experiments\nusing a modified RoPE-based encoding tailored for the DAB module.\nIn our implementation, we retained the basic formulation of RoPE while ensuring different positional\nencodings for the each x and y dimensions, similar to the approach we used with DAB. Specifically,\nwe distinguished the embeddings added to queries and keys from x and y by alternating the cosine\nand sine multiplications for each. For example, if for x we calculate q1x · cos(pos) + q2x · sin(pos),\nthen for y, we compute q1y · sin(pos) + q2y · cos(pos).\nUsing this modified positional encoding, we conduct additional experiments on the zero-shot and the\nfine-tune scenario in Gaussian Process regression tasks using the same settings in the main paper to\nevaluate the impact of RoPE on the performance of our model.\nWe conducted ablation experiments on sinusoidal PE and RoPE in a zero-shot scenario by inferring\non 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, and 5D GP regression data using DANP models trained on 2D and 4D GP\n25\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nTable 22: Comparison of zero-shot performance between DANP trained with the sinusoidal positional\nembedding and RoPE.

The results, presented in Table 22\nand Table 23, indicate that while sinusoidal PE consistently outperforms RoPE in the 1D case, their\nperformance is largely similar across other dimensions. This suggests that for these scenarios, both\nsinusoidal PE and RoPE exhibit comparable interpolation and extrapolation capabilities.\nWe also conducted experiments using the trained models to perform few-shot learning on 1D GP\nregression, following the setup in the main paper. As shown in Table 24, while there were some\nperformance differences in the zero-shot setting for the 1D GP regression task, these differences\nlargely disappeared after few-shot fine-tuning. This indicates that the choice of positional embed-\nding—whether sinusoidal PE or RoPE—has minimal impact on performance once the model is\nfine-tuned.\nD.6\nABLATION ON GP REGRESSION SETUP AND ZERO-SHOT EVALUATION\nBecause most of the models have trouble with extrapolation rather than interpolation, it is important\nto analyze our method’s extrapolation capabilities as compared to its performance in interpolation\nsettings. To address this, we conducted additional experiments by training on the {1, 2}, and {3, 4}\ndimensional cases, then evaluating the results on {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} dimensional test data.\nHere, we train DANP utilizing both sinusoidal PE and RoPE to further analyze their generalization\nability. Table 25 and Table 26 present the performance of DANP when trained on data from {1, 2}\ndimensions and {3, 4} dimensions, respectively.\nFrom Table 25, we observe that when trained on the limited range of {1, 2} dimensions, both\npositional embedding methods fail to learn sufficient general features, leading to lower generalization\nperformance compared to training on {2, 4} or {2, 3, 4} dimensions. This result emphasizes the\nimportance of training on higher-dimensional data to capture general features that enable better\ngeneralization to unseen dimensions. A similar pattern is evident in Table 26.\nHowever, a distinct trend emerges in Table 25 compared to Table 22 and Table 23. While both\nsinusoidal PE and RoPE performed similarly when sufficient general features could be learned from\nmore diverse training dimensions, RoPE demonstrates noticeably weaker generalization ability than\n26\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nTable 24: Comparison of fine-tune performance between DANP trained with the sinusoidal PE and\nthe RoPE.

This result\nhighlights the dependency of RoPE on richer training data which contains richer general features to\nachieve high generalization ability.\nD.7\nADDITIONAL EXTRAPOLATION RESULTS FOR THE FINE-TUNING SCENARIO\nWe conducted additional fine-tuning experiments on 5 d GP regression data to analyze the extrapo-\nlation ability of our method. In this experiment, we aim to compare not only the performance of a\nsingle DANP model against the baselines but also evaluate and compare multiple variants of DANP\ntrained on different dimensional GP data. Specifically, we include DANP models trained on {1, 2},\n{3, 4}, {2, 4}, and {2, 3, 4} dimensional GP data, as well as the corresponding DANP models where\nsinusoidal PE is replaced with RoPE.\nThe results in Table 27 clearly demonstrate that DANP outperforms the baselines in extrapolation\nfew-shot scenarios, showcasing its robustness in handling these challenging tasks. Additionally, we\nobserve that the DANP trained with 1,2d RoPE shows a notable improvement in generalization perfor-\nmance when provided with a few-shot setting. However, despite this improvement, its performance\non the target data remains inferior compared to other DANP training settings, such as those utilizing\nhigher-dimensional data ({3, 4}, {2, 4}, or {2, 3, 4}) or sinusoidal PE.\nD.8\nTRAINING BOTH GP REGRESSION AND IMAGE COMPLETION\nTo further demonstrate the ability of DANP to learn various tasks simultaneously, we conducted an\nexperiment involving both GP regression tasks and image completion tasks. Specifically, we trained\nour model on 2 and 3-dimensional GP regression tasks with the RBF kernel, as well as on EMNIST\nand CelebA image completion tasks. We then evaluated our model using an additional 1-dimensional\nGP regression task. As shown in Table 28, although the performance slightly decreased compared\nto training each task separately, DANP successfully learned all training tasks and generalized well\nto the unseen task.

The model’s performance could be further improved by\nincreasing its capacity, either by expanding the feature space or adding more layers.\nD.9\nADDITIONAL EXTRAPOLATION EXPERIMENTS FOR THE IMAGE COMPLETION TASK\nWe conducted an additional experiment on the CelebA landmark (Liu et al., 2015) task to further\ndemonstrate the capabilities of our method. In the standard CelebA landmark task, the goal is to\npredict the locations of five facial landmarks: left eye, right eye, left mouth corner, right mouth corner,\nand nose, based on a single image. However, since Neural Processes predict a distribution over the\ntarget points using a given context, we adapted the CelebA landmark task to better fit this approach.\nWe modified the task by combining the image’s RGB values with the corresponding coordinates for\neach landmark, creating a 5-dimensional input. The output was restructured as a 5-dimensional label\nrepresenting which of the five facial regions the prediction corresponds to. This setup allowed us to\ntrain and evaluate the model in a way that aligns with the predictive distribution framework of Neural\nProcesses.\nFor the experiment, we used pre-trained models for the baselines, specifically the CelebA image\ncompletion models, while we trained DANP on both the EMNIST dataset and CelebA image\ncompletion tasks. This approach allowed us to assess the performance of DANP under a slightly\nmodified but challenging setup, testing its ability to generalize across different types of tasks. Table 29\nvalidates that DANP still performs well on the different types of tasks compared to other baselines.\n28\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nTable 28: Additional results for training both GP regression tasks and image completion tasks.

These results demonstrate that although the target likelihood of zero-shot DANP\nis lower compared to that of fine-tuned baselines—primarily due to variations in both input and\noutput dimensions from the training data—DANP quickly surpasses other baselines after fine-tuning.\nThis highlights DANP’s robust ability to generalize effectively in challenging zero-shot scenarios\nwhile rapidly improving with minimal fine-tuning.\nD.10\nBAYESIAN OPTIMIZATION\nTo illustrate the wide-ranging applicability of DANP, we conducted BO (Brochu et al., 2010) experi-\nments across various scenarios: 1) a 1-dimensional BO experiment using objective functions derived\nfrom GPs with an RBF kernel, 2) 2 and 3-dimensional BO benchmarks, and 3) hyperparameter tuning\nfor a 3-layer CNN (LeCun et al., 1989) on the CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009) classification task.\nFollowing Nguyen & Grover (2022), we utilized Ackley, Cosine, and Rastrigin benchmark functions\nas the objective functions for the 2 and 3-dimensional BO experiments. For the hyperparameter\ntuning of the 3-layer CNN, we initially trained 1000 CNN models with varying hyperparameters,\nincluding learning rate, batch size, and weight decay, and then identified the optimal hyperparameter\ncombination using NP models. We measured performance using best simple regret, which measures\nthe difference between the current best value and the global best value. And, we run 50 iterations\nfor all the BO experiments. For detailed information about the objective functions in the 2 and\n3-dimensional BO and CNN training, see Appendix C. As baselines, we employed pre-trained models\nfor each n-dimensional GP regression task corresponding to the n-dimensional BO tasks. In contrast,\nfor DANP, we used a single model pre-trained with 2, 3, and 4-dimensional GP regression tasks in\nthe Zero-shot scenario. The results in Fig. 5 demonstrate that DANP outperforms other baselines in\nterms of regret with same iteration numbers. This demonstrates that DANP is capable of serving as a\nsurrogate model for different BO tasks using only a single model without additional training using BO\ndatasets.

The results depicted in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 demonstrate\nthat DANP is proficient in serving as a surrogate model for various BO tasks using only a single model,\nwithout requiring additional training on BO datasets.\nD.11\nIMAGE COMPLETION AND VIDEO COMPLETION\nAdditional visualization examples for the Image completion and Video completion\nIn this\nsection, we provide additional visualization examples for the image completion task using the\nEMNIST and CelebA datasets, as well as for the video completion task with the CelebA video\ndatasets. First, in Fig. 8, we display true video examples generated using the process described in\nAppendix C. It is visually apparent that the images gradually become darker over time. Next, we\nvisualize 10 example images from the EMNIST and CelebA datasets. In Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, the full\nimages are shown in the first column and the context points in the second column. Following that,\nwe sequentially visualize the predicted mean and variance of CANP, ANP, BANP, MPANP, TNP, and\nDANP.

Specifically, we\nassumed real-world scenarios where certain features from patient data might be missing, or entirely\ndifferent sets of features could be collected. Under this assumption, we trained the model using only\na subset of features from the MIMIC-III dataset and evaluated its performance when additional or\ndifferent sets of features became available.\nSpecifically, we considered five features: T, Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, SpO2, and Temperature.\nFor pre-training, we utilized T and Heart Rate features, while for the fine-tuning scenario, we assumed\nonly Respiratory Rate, SpO2, and Temperature features were available (this scenario can happen if\nwe assume that we trained our model with data from hospital A and want to evaluate on the data\nin hospital B). We pre-trained the models with 32,000 training samples and fine-tuned them with\nonly 320 samples. And here, we considered observations from time 0, ..., t as context points and\nt+1, ..., T as target points. As shown in Table 30, our DANP achieved strong performance in the time\nseries blood pressure estimation task, demonstrating robustness and adaptability in this real-world\nscenario.

{"text": "Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Power Systems \n \n1\nDynamic Energy Flow Analysis of Integrated Electricity and Gas \nSystems: A Semi-Analytical Approach \n \nZhikai Huang, Student Member, IEEE, Shuai Lu, Wei Gu, Senior Member, Ruizhi Yu, \nSuhan Zhang, Yijun Xu, Senior Member, IEEE, Yuan Li \n \nAbstract—Ensuring the safe and reliable operation of integrated \nelectricity and gas systems (IEGS) requires dynamic energy flow \n(DEF) simulation tools that achieve high accuracy and \ncomputational \nefficiency. \nHowever, \nthe \ninherent \nstrong \nnonlinearity of gas dynamics and its bidirectional coupling with \npower grids impose significant challenges on conventional \nnumerical algorithms, particularly in computational efficiency \nand accuracy. Considering this, we propose a novel non-iterative \nsemi-analytical algorithm based on differential transformation \n(DT) for DEF simulation of IEGS. First, we introduce a semi-\ndiscrete difference method to convert the partial differential \nalgebraic equations of the DEF model into ordinary differential \nalgebraic equations to resort to the DT.

The synergy \nbetween natural gas networks (NGN) and electric power \nsystems (EPS) significantly enhances energy efficiency and \nreduces emissions [2], yet their complex interdependencies \npose operational risks that demand rigorous analysis. The \nemergence of power-to-gas (P2G) technology is transforming \nNGN-EPS interactions from unidirectional to bidirectional \nexchanges [3], further adding complexity to integrated \nelectricity and gas system (IEGS) operations. \nThe dynamic energy flow (DEF) analysis is a critical \nfoundation for evaluating the operational security of IEGS, \nrequiring large-scale nonlinear partial differential algebraic \nequations (PDAEs). While numerical approaches like finite \ndifference methods (FDMs) [3, 4] and characteristic line \nmethods [5] have been explored for the DEF analysis, they face \ncomputational bottlenecks, including intensive computational \ncost and convergence issues because of the nonlinear NGN and \nEPS equations. In light of this, we develop a semi-analytical \n(SA) algorithm that features high accuracy and low \ncomputational cost for the DEF analysis of IEGS, offering an \nefficient tool for the operational analysis of IEGS. \nB. \nLiterature Review \nThe energy flow analysis of IEGS can be divided into the \nsteady one and the dynamic one based on the energy flow \ntransport models it uses. The steady energy flow analysis uses \nalgebraic equations (AEs) to describe the gas flows in the \npipelines by ignoring the dynamic evolution process, focusing \non the long-term (usually above hours) operational conditions \nof the systems [6]. Comparatively, the DEF analysis uses partial \ndifferential equations (PDEs) to describe the gas flow dynamics \nalong the pipelines, focusing on the short-term (from seconds \nto minutes) operational conditions of the systems [7].  \nThis work focuses on the DEF analysis problem of IEGS, \nwhich is typically large-scale nonlinear PDAEs because of the \noccurrence of the nonlinear gas dynamics in NGN and the \nnonlinear power flow in EPS. To solve the DEF model, the \ntraditional numerical methods consist of two steps: 1) \nDiscretizing the PDEs into AEs using methods such as FDMs \nand finite volume methods; 2) Solving the nonlinear AEs using \niterative methods, typically including Newton’s method, Quasi-\nNewton method, and Levenberg-Marquardt Method. For \nexample, in [8], the implicit Euler difference schemes are used \nto discretize the PDEs of gas flow, and in [4], the centered-\ndifference form in space and the fully implicit algorithm in time \nare proposed for the gas flow equations and then compared with \nother difference schemes under Newton’s method. Although \nthe numerical methods are easy to use, they have some inherent \ndrawbacks. First, in the discretization step, to ensure stability \nand accuracy, the temporal and spatial steps cannot be too large \nand need to satisfy some specific constraints, which usually \nintroduce many variables and equations, greatly increasing the \nproblem scale. Second, in solving the nonlinear AEs, it is very \nchallenging to select a starting point that is guaranteed to be in \nthe convergence region [9], which is still an open problem in \nthe field of nonlinear system computation. \nConsidering the shortcomings of the numerical methods, the \nSA approaches have received some attention in recent years, \nsuch as the differential transformation (DT) and the \nholomorphic embedded (HE) methods [10-12], featuring the \nrigorousness of analytical methods and the flexibility of \nnumerical methods. Particularly, the SA approaches do not \nrequire iterative calculation to solve nonlinear problems and \nthus outperform in calculation accuracy and convergence. In the \nfield of energy systems, the SA approach was first utilized to \nsolve the power flow model with AEs and electromechanical \ntransient simulation with ordinary differential algebraic \nequations (ODAEs) [13, 14]. By contrast, designing an efficient \nSA-based algorithm for the DEF model of IEGS is more \nchallenging since it is a nonlinear PDAE model. \nRecently, the SA approaches have also been explored in the \nfield of integrated energy systems. Yu et al. [15] first \ninvestigate the DT-based SA approach for solving the DEF \nI\n\n\nHuang, et al. Dynamic Energy Flow Analysis of Integrated Electricity and Gas Systems: A Semi-Analytical Approach \n2\nmodel of integrated heat and electricity systems. Zhang et al. \n[16] and Huang et al. [17] explore the HE-based SA approach \nfor solving the DEF model of IEGS, in which the treatment of \ndifference schemes and boundary conditions may cause some \nproblems. Specifically, their approach encounters singularities \nin the coefficient matrix of the equations when addressing loop \nnetworks or multiple gas source problems in NGN due to \ninconsistent pressures at pipeline tail converging on the same \nnode. In [16], an assumption of equal pressures at the head and \ntail of the last segment of these pipelines is made, which may \nintroduce computational errors. Overall, the SA approach for \nthe DEF models is still in the initial stage. The research gaps \ninclude: 1) How to efficiently deal with the PDAE model of \nNGN in the SA approach is still unsolved; 2) it remains unclear \nhow to exploit the special structure of the DEF model in IEGS \nto improve the computing performance. \nC. \nContributions \nTo bridge the aforementioned research gaps, we propose a \nnovel SA algorithm for the DEF model of IEGS, which features \nhigher \ncomputation \nefficiency \nand \nrobustness \nwhile \nmaintaining \nhigh \naccuracy. \nCase \nstudies \nverify \nthe \neffectiveness of the proposed method. The main contributions \nare summarized as follows. \n(1) We propose a novel non-iterative DT-based algorithm for \nthe DEF model of IEGS. Compared with the numerical method, \nit avoids the iterative calculation of the equation and greatly \nreduces the number of matrix inversions. \n(2) We propose a spatial difference scheme and a numerical \nboundary construction method to convert the PDE of gas \ndynamics into ODAEs to resort to the SA approach, solving the \ncoefficient matrix singularity problem in the SA approach and \nfeaturing the 2nd-order spatial precision. \n(3) We propose an adaptive window control technique for the \nDT-based DEF calculation, which uses estimated truncation \nerrors to adjust the size of each time window for higher \nrobustness. \nII. \nPROBLEM DESCRIPTION \nIn this section, we first present the DEF model of IEGS. \nSecond, the initial and boundary conditions for solving the DEF \nmodel are formulated. Finally, the classical FDM-based \nnumerical algorithm for the DEF model is briefly introduced. \nA. \nDynamic Energy Flow Model \nThe DEF model of IEGS includes the NGN model, the EPS \nmodel, and the coupling components model, which are \nintroduced separately in the following.  \n1) \nNatural gas network \nThe NGN transports natural gas from source nodes to load \nnodes through pipelines. The NGN model describes the gas \ndynamics in the pipelines and the mass conservation and \npressure consistency at the nodes. The schematic of the NGN \nmodel is given in Fig. 1. \nThe gas dynamics in the pipeline can be described by the \nmass conservation and momentum conservation equations [18]. \nIn this work, we adopt the following assumptions widely used \nin existing work [3, 19] to model the gas dynamics including: \n1) The pipeline is horizontal; 2) The gas transmission in \npipelines is a constant temperature process; 3) The convection \nin the pipeline is negligible. Under these assumptions, the gas \ndynamics in the pipeline can be described by the continuity \nequation (1a) and momentum equation (1b), as: \n \n2\n0\npl\npl\nj\nj\nj\nm\nc\nt\nS\nl\n\n\n\n+\n=\n\n\n, \n(1a) \n \n0\n2\npl\npl\npl\npl\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\npl\nj\nj\nj\nc m\nm\nm\n+ S\n+\n=\nt\nl\n2D S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, \n(1b) \nwherein 𝑗= 1,2, ⋯, 𝐽 is the index of the pipeline; 𝐽 is the \nnumber of pipelines in NGN; 𝑆𝑗 is the cross-sectional area of \npipeline 𝑗, m2; 𝜆𝑗 is the friction factor of pipeline 𝑗; 𝐷𝑗 is the \ndiameter of pipeline 𝑗, m; 𝑐 is the sound velocity in gas, m s\n⁄ ; \n𝜋𝑗\n𝑝𝑙 is the gas pressure of pipeline 𝑗, Pa; 𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙 is mass flow of \npipeline 𝑗, kg s\n⁄ . \nHere, since 𝜋𝑗\n𝑝𝑙 and 𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙 are spatially distributed along the \npipeline 𝑗, as indicated in Fig. 1, in the following, we use \n𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙(𝑙, 𝑡)  and 𝜋𝑗\n𝑝𝑙(𝑙, 𝑡) , 𝑙∈[0, 𝐿𝑗], 𝑡∈[0, 𝑇]  to denote their \nvalues in the location 𝑙 and time 𝑡 to facilitate the modeling of \nnodes, wherein 𝐿𝑗 is the length of pipeline 𝑗 and 𝑇 is the \nsimulation duration, respectively. Especially we use 𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙(0, 𝑡) \nand 𝜋𝑗\n𝑝𝑙(0, 𝑡)  (or 𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙(𝐿𝑗, 𝑡)  and 𝜋𝑗\n𝑝𝑙(𝐿𝑗, 𝑡) ) to denote the \nvalues at the head (or tail) of pipeline 𝑗 at time 𝑡. \nNext, we introduce three matrixes to describe the mass \nconservation and pressure consistency at the nodes, including \n𝐾𝑖𝑛∈ℝ𝐼×𝐽, 𝐾𝑜𝑢𝑡∈ℝ𝐼×𝐽, and 𝐾𝑐𝑚𝑝∈ℝ𝐼, wherein 𝐼 is the \nnumber of nodes in NGN.

For the electricity-driven compressor with \nknown pressure ratios at node 𝑖 in NGN and bus 𝑏 in EPS, we \nuse the linear model to calculate the power consumption [20], \nas: \n \n(\n)\n(\n)\n,\n,\n0,\ntan\nout\nC\ni\nb\nb\nC\npl\nb i\nb\nb\nK\nK\nS\nm\ni\nt\nq\np\np\nb\n\n\n\n= −\n=\n, \n(1i) \nwherein 𝐾𝑏,𝑖\n𝐶 is the efficiency of the gas compressor; 𝜃𝑏 is the \nphase difference angle of the compressor; 𝑝𝑏 and 𝑞𝑏 are the \nactive and reactive power injection for the bus where the \ncompressor is located, respectively; vector 𝐾𝑖\n𝑜𝑢𝑡 is the 𝑖th row \nof the matrix 𝐾𝑜𝑢𝑡; 𝑆𝐶 is the set of NGN nodes and EPS bus \nlabels where all compressors are located. \nFor the GT that is located at node 𝑖 in NGN and supplies \npower at bus 𝑏 in EPS, the generated power is calculated as [3]: \n \n(\n)\n,\n,\nGFU\ni\ni\nGT\nnd\nb\nb\np =\nK\ni b\nm\nS\n−\n\n\n, \n(1j) \nwherein 𝐾𝑏,𝑖\n𝐺𝑇 is the conversion efficiency of gas into electricity; \n𝑝𝑏 is the active power injection for the bus where the GT is \nlocated; 𝑚𝑖\n𝑛𝑑 is the gas injection for the node where the GT is \nlocated; 𝑆𝐺𝑇 is the set of NGN nodes and EPS bus labels where \nall GTs are located. \nFor the P2G that is located as bus 𝑏 in EPS and supplies gas \nat node 𝑖 in NGN, the gas output can be calculated as [16]: \n \n(\n)\n2\n,\n2\n,\ntan\nP G\ni\ni\nb\nb\nnd\nP G\nb\nb\nb\n=\nK\nm\np\nS\ni b\np\nq\n\n\n=\n−\n\n, \n(1k) \nwherein 𝐾𝑏,𝑖\n𝑃2𝐺 is the conversion efficiency of electricity into gas; \n𝜃𝑏 is the phase difference angle of the P2G; 𝑝𝑏 and 𝑞𝑏 are the \nactive and reactive power injection for the bus where the \ncompressor is located, respectively; 𝑚𝑖\n𝑛𝑑 is the gas injection for \nthe node where the P2G is located; 𝑆𝑃2𝐺 is the set of NGN \nnodes and EPS bus where the P2Gs are located. \nB. \nInitial and Boundary Conditions \nFor the DEF model, the initial and boundary conditions are \nthe prerequisites for the uniqueness of the solution. The initial \nconditions provide the initial values of states for solving the \n(partial) differential equations, while the boundary conditions \noffer state constraints at the boundaries of the systems. In the \ncontext of IEGS, the initial conditions define the initial states of \nthe gas pressure and mass flow of the gas pipelines at the \nbeginning of the simulation, as: \n \n(\n)\n( )\n0,\n,\n1,2,\n,\nini\npl\nj\nj\nt\nj\nl,0 =\nl\nL\nj\nJ\nl\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n, \n(1l) \n \n(\n)\n( )\n0,\n,\n1,2,\n,\ninit\npl\nj\nj\nj\nl,0 = m\nl\nl\nL\nj\nJ\nm\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n, \n(1m) \nwherein 𝜋𝑗\n𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 and 𝑚𝑗\n𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 are the initial values of pipeline \npressure and mass flow, respectively. \nThe boundary conditions include the ones of NGN, EPS, and \ncoupling components. For NGN, the boundary conditions \ninclude the gas pressure of gas source nodes and the mass flow \nof load nodes, as: \n \n( )\n( )\nc\nnd\nsrc\nsr\ni\n=\nt\ni\nS\nt\n\n\n\n, \n(1n) \n \n( )\n( )\nd\nnd\nld\nl\ni\nm\n=\nt\nt\ni\nm\nS\n\n, \n(1o) \nwherein 𝜋𝑠𝑟𝑐∈ℝ𝑁𝑠𝑟𝑐 is the known vector of pressure of source \nnodes; 𝑚𝑙𝑜𝑎𝑑∈ℝ𝑁𝑙𝑑 is the known vector of the mass flow of \nload nodes; 𝑁𝑠𝑟𝑐 and 𝑁𝑙𝑑 are the number of source and load \nnodes in NGN, respectively; 𝑆𝑠𝑟𝑐 and 𝑆𝑙𝑑 are the set of source \nand load nodes in NGN, respectively. \nFor EPS, the boundary conditions include the injected active \npower 𝑝𝑃𝑉(𝑡) and voltage amplitude 𝑈𝑃𝑉(𝑡) of PV buses, the \ninjected active power 𝑝𝑃𝑉(𝑡) and reactive power 𝑞𝑃𝑉(𝑡) of PQ \nbuses, and the real parts 𝑒𝑠𝑙𝑘(𝑡) and imaginary 𝑓𝑠𝑙𝑘(𝑡) of the \nvoltage of the slack bus, as: \n \n( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\n,\nb\nPV\nPV\nPV\nb t\nt\np\n= p\nt U\n=U\nt\nb\nS\n\n, \n(1p) \n \n( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\n,\nb\nP\nP\nQ\nQ\nQ\nP\nb t\nt\np\n= p\nt\nq\n= q\nt\nb\nS\n\n, \n(1q) \n \n( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\n,\nb\nslk\nlk\nsl\nb\ns\nk\ne\n=\nt\nt\n= e\nt\nf\nf\nt\nb\nS\n\n, \n(1r) \nwherein 𝑆𝑃𝑉, 𝑆𝑃𝑄, and 𝑆𝑠𝑙𝑘 are the sets of labels for PV, PQ, \nand slack bus, respectively.  \nFurthermore, the boundary conditions for coupling \ncomponents hinge on their respective control strategies. \nElectricity-driven compressors, serving as PQ buses in EPS, \nhave their active and reactive power determined by the mass \nflow through them in NGN via the equation (1i), which remains \nunknown prior to calculation. GTs serving as the slack bus in \nEPS and the load node in NGN have known real and imaginary \nvoltage components. However, their unknown power must be \nderived through power flow calculations, while the mass flow \nof consumed gas is solved using the equation (1j) based on their \n\n\nHuang, et al.

Then, by combining them with the equations (1c)-(1r), \nwe can get the AEs system for the DEF analysis. Next, we need \nto solve the nonlinear AEs, for which the classical method is \nNewton’s method.  \nIII. DIFFERENTIAL TRANSFORMATION OF DEF MODEL \nIn this section, we first introduce the principles and rules of \nDT. Second, we propose the semi-discrete method to transform \nthe PDEs of gas dynamics into ordinary differential equations \n(ODEs), based on which the PDAE system of the DEF model \nis converted into nonlinear ODAEs. Finally, we propose the \nDT-based SA approach for the DEF model. \nA. \nIntroduction of Differential Transformation \nThe DT method converts the nonlinear ODAEs to linear AEs. \nThen, the semi-analytical solutions (SASs) are obtained by \ncalculating the DT coefficients of the unknown variables in the \nnonlinear ODAEs [11]. We start from the generic ODAEs, as: \n \n( )\nMx\nf x\n=\n, \n(3a) \nwherein 𝑥∈ℝ𝑁 are the variables; 𝑓(𝑥): ℝ𝑁→ℝ𝑁 are \n(nonlinear) AEs; 𝑀 is the mass matrix. \nIn this paper, for the variable (⋅), we use (⋅)\n̂[𝑘] to denote its \n𝑘th order DT coefficient. For the equations (3a), the DT \ncoefficients 𝑥̂[𝑘] of the variables 𝑥 are defined as: \n \n\n( )\n0\n1\nˆ\n0,1,\n,\n!\nk\nk\nt t\nd x t\nx k\nk\nK\nk\ndt\n=\n\n\n=\n=\n\n\n\n\n, \n(3b) \nwherein 𝐾 is the selected order of the DT method. \nOnce we obtain the values of 𝑥̂[𝑘], 𝑘= 0,1, ⋯, 𝐾, the \napproximated SAS of 𝑥 can be represented as: \n \n( )\n(\n)\n0\n0\nˆ\nK\nk\nk\nx t\nx k\nt\nt\n=\n\n\n−\n\n. \n(3c) \nNow, we list the transformation laws used in this paper as \nfollows [10, 11, 13], and interested readers can refer to [11] for \na detailed introduction to DT theory: 1) 𝑐→𝑐𝛿[𝑘] ≜{𝑐, 𝑘= 0\n0, 𝑘≥1, \n2) 𝑥(0) →𝑥̂[0], 3) 𝑐𝑥(𝑡) →𝑐𝑥̂[𝑘], 4) 𝑥(𝑡) ± 𝑦(𝑡) →𝑥̂[𝑘] ±\n𝑦̂[𝑘], 5) 𝑥(𝑡) ⋅𝑦(𝑡) →∑\n𝑥̂[𝑚] ⋅𝑦̂[𝑘−𝑚]\n𝑘\n𝑚=0\n≜𝑥̂[𝑘] ⊗𝑦̂[𝑘],  \n6) ( )\n\n( )\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n,\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n,\n1\nˆ 0\nk\nm\nk\nx\nk\nm\nx k\nm\nx t\nx\nx\nk\nx\n−\n=\n\n=\n\n\n→\n\n\n\n\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n, \n7) \n( )\n( )\n\n\n1\nˆ\nˆ\ny t\ny k\nk\nx t\nx\n→\n\n, and 8) \n(\n) \n\nˆ\n1\n1\ndx\nk\nx k\ndt →\n+\n+\n. \nB. \nSemi-Discrete Method of PDE \nObviously, the DT method cannot directly deal with the \nPDEs of gas dynamics. Hence, we propose to use the semi-\ndiscrete method to transform the PDEs into ODEs. \n1) \nSemi-discrete differences \nWe employ the semi-discrete method [22, 23], also called the \nmethod of lines, to transform PDEs into ODEs. Specifically, for \nthe nonlinear PDEs presented in the equations (1a) and (1b), we \ncan reformulate them into a generalized form as follows: \n \n(\n)\n1,2,\n,\npl\npl\nj\nj\npl\nj\nj\nj\nu\nu\n+V\n= Z\nu\nj\nJ\nt\nl\n\n\n=\n\n\n, \n(4a) \nwherein 𝑢𝑗\n𝑝𝑙= [𝜋𝑗\n𝑝𝑙   𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙]\n⊤; 𝑍𝑗(𝑢𝑗) = [0   −𝜆𝑗𝑐2𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙|𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙| ∕\n(2𝐷𝑗𝑆𝑗𝜋𝑗\n𝑝𝑙)]\n⊤, and \n \n2\n0\n0\nj\nj\nj\nc\nS\nV\nS\n\n\n= \n\n\n\n\n\n. \nThen, we keep the time derivative and only discretize the \nspace derivative term using a central difference scheme [24], as: \n \n,\n1\n,\n1\n1,2,\n,\n1\nj n\nj n\nseg\nj\npl\npl\npl\nju\nu\nu\nn\nN\nl\nl\n+\n−\n\n−\n=\n=\n−\n\n\n. \n(4b) \nBy substituting (4b) into (4a), we have \n \n(\n)\n,\n,\n1\n,\n1\n,\n1,2,\n,\n1\npl\npl\np\nj n\nj n\nj n\nseg\nj\nj\nj\nl\np\nn\nj\nl\ndu\nu\nu\nV\nZ\nu\nn\nN\ndt\nl\n+\n−\n−\n=\n+\n=\n−\n\n. (4c) \nAlso, the initial conditions (1l) and (1m) become \n \n( )\n(\n)\n(\n)\n,\n,\n0,1\n,\n0\n0\n,\ng\npl\npl\ni\nse\nj n\nj\nj\nnit\nj\nu\nn\n= u\nn l\nu\nn l\nN\n\n=\n\n=\n. \n(4d) \nRemark 1. For pipeline 𝑗 comprising 𝑁𝑗\n𝑠𝑒𝑔 segments, the \n\n\nSubmitted to IEEE Transactions on Power Systems \n \n5\nequations (4b) encompass a total of 2𝑁𝑗\n𝑠𝑒𝑔−2  equations. \nHowever, there are 2𝑁𝑗\n𝑠𝑒𝑔+ 2 variables in these equations. \nEven after accounting for the two boundary conditions at the \nhead and tail of the pipeline, the system remains \nunderdetermined, with fewer equations than unknowns. This \ndiscrepancy arises because the adopted spatial discretization \nscheme utilizes points on both sides to approximate the spatial \npartial derivative of the intermediate point state. To address this \nissue, we propose the numerical boundary conditions. \n2) \nNumerical boundary conditions \nFirst, we perform the eigendecomposition of 𝑉𝑗 in (4a) as \n𝑉𝑗= 𝑣𝑗Λ𝑗𝑣𝑗\n−1, wherein 𝑣𝑗= [𝑐𝑆𝑗\n⁄\n   −𝑐𝑆𝑗\n⁄\n; 1   1]. Then, we \nhave \n \n1\n0\n0\nj\nj\nj\nj\nV\nc\nv\nv\nc\n−\n\n\n=\n= \n\n−\n\n\n, \n \nDefine 𝑤𝑗\n𝑝𝑙≜[𝑤𝑗\n𝑝𝑙,1 𝑤𝑗\n𝑝𝑙,2]\n⊤≜𝑣𝑗\n−1𝑢𝑗\n𝑝𝑙= 1 (2𝑐)\n⁄\n[𝑆𝑗𝜋𝑗\n𝑝𝑙+\n𝑐𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙   −𝑆𝑗𝜋𝑗\n𝑝𝑙+ 𝑐𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙]⊤. Then, from (4a) we have: \n \n(\n)\n1\npl\npl\nj\nj\npl\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nw\nw\n+\n= v Z\nv w\nt\nl\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n. \n(4e) \nAccording to the total differential formula, we have \n \npl\npl\npl\nj\nj\nj\ndw\nw\nw\ndl\n+\ndt\nt\nl dt\n\n\n= \n\n. \n(4f) \nIf we set the slope of the characteristic line as \n \ndl\nc\ndt = , \nthen the first term of the PDE in (4e) can be converted to ODE \n \n,1\n2\n4\npl\npl\nj\nj\npl\npl\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nm\nm\ndw\nc\n=\ndt\nD S\n\n\n−\n. \n(4g) \nWe set the spatial step ∆𝑥= 𝐿𝑗𝑁𝑗\n𝑠𝑒𝑔\n⁄\n and the temporal step \n∆𝑡= ∆𝑙𝑐\n⁄  here, respectively. By Integrating both sides of (4g), \nalong the characteristic line, we have \n \n(\n)\n(\n)\n,1\n,1\n2\n,\n,\n0,1,2,\n4\npl\npl\nj\nj\npl\nj\nj\npl\npl\nj\nj\nj\nj\nt n t\nj\nt\nj\nw\nL t\nn t\nw\nL\nn l t\nm\nm\nc\ndt\nn\nD S\n\n\n+ \n−\n+ \n−\n\n= −\n=\n\n. \n(4h) \nGiven that 𝑤𝑗\n𝑝𝑙,1 is continuous, according to the mean value \ntheorems for integrals, the integral on the right-hand side in (4h) \ncan be expressed as \n \n(\n)\n*\n*\n,\npl\npl\nj\nj\nn\nn\npl\nj\nt\nt n\nt\nm\nm\ndt\nh\nn t\nl t\n\n+ \n=\n\n\n, \n(4i) \nwherein 𝐿𝑗−𝑛∆𝑙≤𝑙𝑛\n∗≤𝐿𝑗; 𝑡≤𝑡𝑛\n∗≤𝑡+ 𝑛∆𝑡; ℎ(𝑙𝑛\n∗, 𝑡𝑛\n∗) ≜\n𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙(𝑙𝑛\n∗, 𝑡𝑛\n∗)|𝑚𝑗\n𝑝𝑙(𝑙𝑛\n∗, 𝑡𝑛\n∗)| 𝜋𝑗\n𝑝𝑙(𝑙𝑛\n∗, 𝑡𝑛\n∗)\n⁄\n. \nHence, (4h) can be written as: \n \n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n2\n,\n*\n1\n,1\n*\n,\n,\n4\n,\nj\npl\npl\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nn\nj\nn\nc\nw\nL t\nn t\nw\nL\nl\nt\nn\nt\nt\nh\nn\nD S\nl\n\n−\n+ \n−\n\n= −\n. (4j) \nSecond, by using the linear interpolation is considered at \n(𝐿𝑗, 𝑡+ 2𝐿(𝑐𝑁𝑖\n𝑠𝑒𝑔)\n⁄\n), we have: \n \n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n,1\n,1\n2\n,1\n,\n2\n2\n,\n,\npl\npl\nj\nj\nj\nj\npl\nj\nj\nw\nL t\nt\nw\nL t\nt\nw\nL t\nO\nt\n+ \n=\n+ \n−\n+\n\n. \n(4k) \nBased on (4j), we get \n \n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n,1\n,1\n,1\n,1\n2\n*\n*\n*\n2\n2\n1\n*\n1\n,\n2\n2\n2\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n2\npl\npl\nj\nj\nj\nj\npl\npl\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nw\nL t\nt\nw\nL\nl t\nw\nL t\nt\nw\nL\nl t\nc\nh l\nh l\nt\nt\nD S\nt\n\n+ \n−\n\n−\n+ \n−\n\n=\n−\n−\n−\n−\n\n. \n(4l) \nTherefore, by combining (4k) and (4l), we have: \n \n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n,1\n,1\n,1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1\n*\n*\n*\n*\n,\n2\n,\n2\n,\n,\n2\n,\npl\npl\npl\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nw\nt\nL\nl t\nw\nL\nl t\nw\nL t\nc\nh l\nh l\nt\nO\nt\nD S\nt\n\n\n−\n\n+\n=\n−\n+\n\n−\n−\n. \n(4m) \nBy expanding ℎ(𝑙2\n∗, 𝑡2\n∗) in a Taylor series at (𝑙1\n∗, 𝑡1\n∗), we have: \n \n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n2\n2\n1\n1\n2\n1\n2\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n1\n*\n,\n,\nh l\nh l\no l\nl\no t\nt\no\nl\no\nt\nt\nt\n−\n−\n+\n=\n−\n=\n\n+\n\n.

Now, the original DEF model of IEGS, (1a)-(1r), \nis transformed into 𝑘-domain system, as given in (5a)-(8c). It \ncan be found that the 𝑘-domain system defines the linear \nrecursive equations of 𝑘th order DT coefficients, i.e., the 𝑘th \norder DT coefficients can be obtained by solving a linear system \nonce the 0th order to (𝑘−1)th order DT coefficients are known. \nTherefore, through the DT-based SA algorithm, once the order \n𝐾 is selected, we can obtain the values of the 𝑘th order DT \ncoefficients from 𝑘= 1 to 𝑘= 𝐾 sequentially by solving the \nlinear equations, and then get the time-domain analytical \nsolutions of unknows based on (3c). \nRemark 3. Note that, if the semi-discrete difference scheme \n(4b) becomes 𝜕𝑢𝑗\n𝑝𝑙𝜕𝑥\n⁄\n= (𝑢𝑗,𝑛\n𝑝𝑙−𝑢𝑗,𝑛−1\n𝑝𝑙\n) Δ𝑥\n⁄\n, the number of \nequations equals the number of unknown variables. However, \nDT of the ODE (4c) in NGN will decouple the pressure and \nmass flow of the gas in these equations, where the only variable \nin each equation is pressure or mass flow, resulting in the \nsingularity of the coefficient matrix of the equation after DT in \nNGN with loop network. \nIV.

First, we reveal the inherent block \nstructure within the linear equations of the DT coefficients. \nSecond, we derive a non-iterative solution method based on the \nblock characteristics. Finally, we propose an adaptive time \nwindow control technique to adjust the DT time window by \nestimating the truncation error of the solution. \nA. \nBlock Structure of DT Coefficient Equations \nFirst, we define some new symbols to denote the DT \ncoefficients as: \n \n\n\n\n(\n)\n1\n,\n2\n1\n1,\n,\n,\n0\nˆ\n  \n ?\nˆ\nˆ\nJ\nse\nj\nseg\nj\nj\ng\nN\npl\npl\npl\nj\nJ\nj\nj N\nu\nk\nu\nk\nu\nk\n=\n+\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, \n \n \n\n\n\n2\n1,\n,\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nnd\nnd\nnd\nI\ni\ni\ni\nI\nu\nk\nk\nm\nk\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n. \n \nWe denote 𝑝𝑐𝑝 as the unknown injection active power of the \nbuses where the GT serving as the slack bus in EPS and the \nelectricity-driven compressors are located.

Therefore, whether this \nnode is a source node or a load node, the coefficient matrix \n𝑊22 is full rank. \nIn addition, we find that 𝑊22  is only related to the \nparameters given in NGN, and there is no need to update \nduring simulation. \n3) \nStep 3: Calculate the states of coupling nodes and EPS \nby non-iterative method \nNext, the equations 𝐹2,2, 𝐹3,2, 𝐹4 and 𝐹5,2 for EPS and the \nnode with the GT serving as the slack bus in EPS can be written \nas: \n \n\n\n\n31 1\n32\n2\n33\n3\n3\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nk\nk\nW x k\nW x k\nW x k\nb\n+\n+\n=\n \n(9g) \nwhere 𝑥̂1[𝑘] and 𝑥̂2[𝑘] is already solved in the previous steps. \nWe consider the coefficient matrix 𝑊33\n𝑘 for 𝑥̂3[𝑘] here. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n,3\n,3\n,\n2,2\n3,2\n3,2\n4\n4\n2\n4\n5,2\n5,\n3\n3\n2\n1 1\n,3\n,\n,\n32\n2\n2\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n,\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n1,\n,\no\npl\npl\nnd\npl\nd\nC u\nd\ncp\nCou\nn\nk\nn\nu\nk\nu\nk\nu\nk\nu\nk\nu\nk\ne k\nf\nK\nk\nx\ne k\nf\nf\nf\nf\nf\nf\np\np\nf\nf\np\nb\nk\nf k\nk\nu\nk\nk\nW\nk\nW x\nk\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n−\n−\n=\n=\n \n(9h) \n\n\nHuang, et al. Dynamic Energy Flow Analysis of Integrated Electricity and Gas Systems: A Semi-Analytical Approach \n8\nThe first two rows and the last row of 𝑊33\n𝑘 are similar to \nthose of 𝑊22, except that the original boundary conditions are \nchanged into the coupling equations. For the GT serving as the \nslack bus in EPS, its mass flow is calculated by the injected \npower of the bus. For electricity-driven compressors, the \ninjected power of the corresponding bus is calculated from the \npreviously calculated mass flow through the compressor by \n(8a). The third row of 𝑊33\n𝑘 represents the power flow equations \nof EPS. As described in the review, in step 3, the EPS \nequations and NGN nodal equations with the GT serving as the \nslack bus in EPS are integrated through the coupling \ncomponents equations. We increase the equations about the \nactive power flow of the slack bus and the energy flow \nconversion equations of the electricity-driven compressors by \nthe same amount as the number of unknowns for the injected \nactive power of the slack bus and buses with electricity-driven \ncompressors. \nFurthermore, in this step, we find that 𝑊33 is related to the \n0th DT coefficient about EPS, independent of the order 𝑘, and \nonly needs to be updated once in each time window. \nBased on the above matrix partition, we use the non-iterative \ntechnique to solve the problem according to the characteristics \nof IEGS and DT. The simulation process of IEGS DEF by DT \nmethod is shown in Algorithm 1. \nB. \nAdaptive Time Window Control Technique \nTo compute the 0th order DT coefficient for the subsequent \ntime window, we employ the adaptive window control \ntechnique [15], which is an evolution of the stepsize control \nstrategy utilized in the Runge-Kutta method [25]. This \ntechnique dynamically adjusts the time window for each \ncalculation based on the error tolerance we set, thereby \nmitigating the risk of result divergence during significant \nsystem state changes and enhancing simulation robustness. \nAlgorithm 2 outlines the procedure for implementing the \nadaptive time window control technique. Initially, we estimate \nthe truncation error 𝑦̃ of the (𝐾−1)th order DT coefficient \nusing the 𝐾th DT coefficients obtained. Subsequently, we \ndetermine the error tolerance 𝜀 by considering the absolute \ntolerance Atol, relative tolerance Rtol, and the variable values \nwithin the time window. The root mean square error 𝑒𝑟𝑟 is \nthen calculated using 𝑦̃ and 𝜀, and the size of the time window \nis adjusted under the constraint of the change rate. Wherein \n𝑓𝑎𝑐 represents a conservative factor less than one; 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑚𝑎𝑥 \nand 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑚𝑖𝑛 serve as upper and lower bounds to prevent abrupt \nchanges in temporal steps; 𝑦̂[𝐾] denotes the vector containing \nall 𝑁 DT coefficients of the 𝐾th order. \nRemark 4. When calculating the DT coefficients of each \norder for the states between nodes in NGN during step 2, we \nobserve that these coefficients are decoupled by the pipeline \nand do not mutually influence each other. This decoupling \narises because the DT coefficients of the internal state of the \npipeline have already been computed in step 1, thus preventing \nthe nodes from interacting through the pipeline. However, it is \nimportant to note that this decoupling is specific to the \ncalculation of a particular order of the DT coefficient. The \nchanges in the node state variables remain coupled within the \ntime window. This coupling occurs because the computation \nof subsequent order DT coefficients involves the DT \ncoefficient of the internal state of the pipeline, which is \ninfluenced by the DT coefficient at the boundary of pipelines, \nwhich in turn is related to the node state. \nV. CASE STUDIES \nIn this section, the proposed non-iterative method is tested \non two systems: 1) a 50 km single gas pipeline; 2) a 133-node-\n118-bus system. For comparative analysis, the following \nmethods are employed: 1) M1: Characteristic line method \nsolved using Newton’s method, serving as the benchmark for \naccuracy analysis; 2) M2: Implicit Euler difference scheme \nsolved using Newton’s method; M3: Implicit central \ndifference scheme solved using Newton’s method; M4: DT \nmethod with 5th order.  \nIn the first system, we demonstrate the superior accuracy of \nthe proposed method compared to the numerical methods. In \nthe second system, we validate the increased computational \nefficiency of the proposed method over the numerical methods. \nAll tests are conducted using Python 3.11.9 on a computer with \nan Intel i9-13900K CPU and 96 GB of RAM. \n\n\nSubmitted to IEEE Transactions on Power Systems \n \n9\nA. \nA 50km Single Gas Pipeline System \nThe single gas pipeline system comprises a pipeline linking \nthe source and load nodes [3]. The source node pressure is \nfixed at 300 kPa, whereas the load mass flow varies: it \ndecreases from 1.2 kg/s to 0.8 kg/s when time reaches 0.5 \nhours, then increases to 2 kg/s at 1.5 hours, and decreases \ngradually after 2 hours.  \nThe results obtained from M1 are utilized as reference data \nto assess the accuracy of M2-M4. A uniform spatial step of 1 \nkm is adopted for all simulations. For M2 and M3, the tests are \nperformed at temporal steps of 180 seconds and 9 seconds. The \nadaptive time window control technique is employed in M4 to \nensure that the temporal step yields the results within the \nacceptable error tolerance, thereby enhancing the robustness of \nthe proposed method against significant disturbances. \nAs we can see from Fig. 2, the results obtained by M2 and \nM3 with a small temporal step and M4 are close to the \nreference data generated by M1, indicating the high accuracy \nachieved by these methods. In contrast, M2 and M3 with a \nlarger temporal step exhibit a more significant error. Table I \npresents    h m th  ’s    t m    sq          s (RM Es) \ncompared to the reference data to quantify the accuracy \ndifferences. This quantitative assessment yields a notable \nobservation: Numerical methods require considerably smaller \ntemporal steps to attain accuracy levels comparable to M4. \nAlthough refining the temporal discretization enhances \naccuracy, it substantially increases computational costs and \nexecution time, rendering it challenging for real-time \napplications or large-scale simulations. Consequently, M4 \nstands out as an effective and practical choice for addressing \ncomplex integrated energy network problems, owing to its \ninherent ability to maintain high accuracy. \nB. \nA 133-node & 118-bus System \nThe effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are \nvalidated in a large-scale system, which is an improved system \nof the 133-node NGN and IEEE 118-bus EPS from [26, 27]. \nThe coupling components in the system consist of 5 GTs, a \nP2G, and an electricity-driven compressor. Specifically, the \nGT serving as the slack bus at bus 69 in EPS is supported by \nNGN at node 89. The remaining 4 GTs, serving as PV buses at \nbuses 10, 12, 49, and 61 in EPS, are supported by NGN at \nnodes 133, 130, 90, and 98, respectively. The P2G at node 79 \nin NGN is supplied by EPS at bus 59, and the electricity-driven \ncompressor at node 84 in NGN is powered by EPS at bus 114. \nUtilizing the results obtained from M1 with a spatial step of \n500 m as a baseline, the calculation accuracy and speed of \nmethods M2-M4 are evaluated under the same spatial step of \n1000 m.  \nAs shown in Fig. 3, M2-M4 effectively capture the dynamic \nchanges in mass flow and pressure in NGN, and voltage \n(a) \n(b) \nFig. 2.

Dynamic Energy Flow Analysis of Integrated Electricity and Gas Systems: A Semi-Analytical Approach \n10 \ndistribution in EPS. Particularly for the mass flow and pressure \nstates in NGN, the results of M2 and M3 with smaller temporal \nsteps and M4 exhibit good agreement with the reference results. \nHowever, M2 and M3 with a large temporal step deviate \nsubstantially when the system boundary changes significantly. \nWe can find from Table II that the calculation accuracy of M4 \nin EPS is comparable to that of M2 and M3. Notably, the \naccuracy of M4 in NGN surpasses that of M2 and M3 with \nsimilar temporal steps. Furthermore, despite M3 with 2nd \norder precision in the difference scheme, numerical \noscillations occur during the simulation process, leading to \nlower mass flow calculation accuracy than M2 with 1st order \nprecision. \nAs presented in Table III, a comparative analysis of the \ncomputational cost among multiple methods reveals further \nadvantages of M4 over numerical methods such as M2 and M3. \nThe advantage of M4 lies in its utilization of recursive \ncalculations and linear equation solving, eliminating the \nrequirement for iterative solutions. As a result, when using \ncomparable temporal steps, M2 and M3 demonstrate longer \ntotal calculation times than the proposed M4. Previous \nfindings show that M2 and M3 require considerably smaller \ntemporal steps to achieve an accuracy level comparable to M4. \nFurthermore, it is well-established that, for the given method, \ncalculation time is directly proportional to the number of \ncalculation steps and inversely proportional to the size of the \ntemporal step. This relationship further confirms the superior \ncomputational efficiency of the proposed M4 method.  \nVI. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we have addressed the challenges associated \nwith DEF simulation in IEGS by proposing a novel non-\niterative SA method based on DT. Our method achieves high \naccuracy with a small computational cost by leveraging the \nrecursive properties of DT. Simulation results demonstrate the \neffectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. \nREFERENCES \n[1] J. Wu, J.

{"text": "Persuasion Should be Double-Blind: A Multi-Domain Dialogue Dataset\nWith Faithfulness Based on Causal Theory of Mind\nDingyi Zhang♠and Deyu Zhou*♠\n♠School of Computer Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Computer Network\nand Information Integration, Ministry of Education, Southeast University, China\n{zhangdy, d.zhou}@seu.edu.cn\nAbstract\nPersuasive dialogue plays a pivotal role in hu-\nman communication, influencing various do-\nmains. Recent persuasive dialogue datasets of-\nten fail to align with real-world interpersonal in-\nteractions, leading to unfaithful representations.\nFor instance, unrealistic scenarios may arise,\nsuch as when the persuadee explicitly instructs\nthe persuader on which persuasion strategies\nto employ, with each of the persuadee’s ques-\ntions corresponding to a specific strategy for\nthe persuader to follow. This issue can be at-\ntributed to a violation of the \"Double Blind\"\ncondition, where critical information is fully\nshared between participants. In actual human\ninteractions, however, key information—such\nas the mental state of the persuadee and the\npersuasion strategies of the persuader—is not\ndirectly accessible.\nThe persuader must in-\nfer the persuadee’s mental state using Theory\nof Mind capabilities and construct arguments\nthat align with the persuadee’s motivations.\nTo address this gap, we introduce ToMMA,\na novel multi-agent framework for dialogue\ngeneration that is guided by causal Theory of\nMind. This framework ensures that informa-\ntion remains undisclosed between agents, pre-\nserving \"double-blind\" conditions, while causal\nToM directs the persuader’s reasoning, enhanc-\ning alignment with human-like persuasion dy-\nnamics.\nConsequently, we present CToM-\nPersu, a multi-domain, multi-turn persuasive\ndialogue dataset that tackles both double-blind\nand logical coherence issues, demonstrating su-\nperior performance across multiple metrics and\nachieving better alignment with real human di-\nalogues. Our dataset and prompts are available\nat https://github.com/DingyiZhang/ToMMA-\nCToMPersu.\n1\nIntroduction\nPersuasive dialogue generation is critical in various\nAI applications, including education, healthcare\n* Corresponding author.\nFigure 1: An example illustrating the unnaturalness of\nan LLM-generated dataset. In the figure, the blue text\nhighlights instances where the persuadee mistakenly\nadopts the persuader’s arguments while expressing their\nown viewpoint. Moreover, as indicated by the red text,\nthe persuadee never actively presents arguments sup-\nporting their presumed stance—in this case, the benefits\nof the Shopping Mall. Instead, they merely guide the\npersuader to apply persuasion techniques on them.\ncounseling, and business marketing (Rogiers et al.,\n2024). An effective persuasion system must in-\ntegrate intention detection to understand the per-\nsuadee’s intentions (Sakurai and Miyao, 2024),\nstrategy detection to identify suitable persuasive\ntechniques (Jin et al., 2023), and credibility main-\ntenance to ensure trustworthiness (Furumai et al.,\n2024). Although large language models (LLMs)\nhave made remarkable strides in natural language\nprocessing, generating human-like persuasive con-\nversations remains a significant challenge. Cur-\nrent human dialogue datasets are predominantly\narXiv:2502.21297v1  [cs.CL]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\ndomain-specific, such as those focused on char-\nity fundraising (Wang et al., 2019), product rec-\nommendations (Li et al., 2018), or medical con-\nsultations (Zeng et al., 2020). This narrow focus\nlimits the ability of models to generalize across dif-\nferent persuasive contexts, preventing them from\nfully exploiting the benefits of large-scale, pre-\ntrained models. Additionally, the relatively small\nsize of these datasets hinders the development of\npersuasion systems capable of generating strategi-\ncally sound and personalized responses. Recent\nefforts have explored using GPT-4 to create large-\nscale, multi-domain persuasive dialogue datasets\n(Jin et al., 2024), providing a wider range of scenar-\nios and more diverse conversational patterns than\nearlier datasets.\nFigure 2: Causal Theory of Mind\nDespite the advancements in GPT-4-generated\nmulti-domain persuasive dialogue datasets, several\nissues arise due to limitations in prompt and frame-\nwork design. (1) Inconsistencies in the logical flow\nof conversations are common, where the persuadee\ninadvertently reinforces the persuader’s arguments\nwhen articulating their stance, thus weakening their\nown position. For example, as shown in Fig. 1, the\npersuadee’s intention is to invest in a new shop-\nping mall. However, in expressing their viewpoint,\nthey mention \"city growth,\" which is actually a\nbenefit highlighted by the persuader’s argument for\ninvesting in residential areas. This creates a dis-\nconnect and reduces the realism of the dialogue.\n(2) Unrealistic behaviors, such as the persuadee\nexplicitly instructing the persuader on which per-\nsuasion strategies to adopt, are also prevalent. In\nsuch instances, each of the persuadee’s questions\ncorresponds directly to a specific strategy the per-\nsuader is supposed to follow. As demonstrated in\nFig. 1, the colored text in the dialogue corresponds\none-to-one, such as the persuadee’s statement \"in-\nvestment in the long run\" aligning with \"long-term\ninvestment\" in the strategy. This pattern persists\nthroughout the entire conversation. In real human\ninteractions, crucial information, such as the men-\ntal state of the persuadee and the persuasion strate-\ngies of the persuader, is not directly accessible.\nInstead, the persuader must infer the persuadee’s\nmental state using Theory of Mind (ToM) capabili-\nties and construct arguments that resonate with the\npersuadee’s mental state.\nTo further validate our findings, we quantita-\ntively compared two datasets using the proposed\nevaluation metric: PersuasionForGood, a small-\nscale dataset of real conversations focused on\npersuading people to donate, and DailyPersua-\nsion, a large-scale, multi-domain, multi-turn di-\nalogue dataset generated by GPT-4. The evaluation\nmethod we introduce is called Causal Theory of\nMind Evaluation. As shown in Fig. 2, Causal The-\nory of Mind refers to the use of Theory of Mind\nto influence others’ behaviors. To prevent a spe-\ncific action, it is sufficient to alter a person’s be-\nlief or desire. However, to encourage someone\nto take a specific action, both their belief and de-\nsire must be addressed (Wu et al., 2024b). Re-\nsearch indicates that all humans possess the ability\nof Theory of Mind and apply this ability in ev-\neryday interpersonal interactions. Therefore, even\nthough Causal Theory of Mind may not be explic-\nitly mentioned during data collection, individuals\nstill unconsciously utilize such abilities and con-\nversational logic in real-life dialogues. Based on\nthis, we argue that using this evaluation method to\nassess the authenticity of LLM-generated datasets\nis both reasonable and valid. As shown in Tab. 1,\nwe observe that both the LLM-generated dataset\nand the human dialogue dataset perform well when\nevaluated using Direct Prompting, where the LLM\nevaluator directly assesses whether the persuadee\nhas been persuaded. However, when the LLM eval-\nuator is required to follow human logic to make\nthis judgment (CToM Eval), the persuasion success\nrate of the LLM-generated dataset drops by 35.95%.\nIn contrast, while the human dataset also experi-\nences a decline, it is much smaller, at only 9%.\nThis suggests that although the LLM-generated\ndataset appears persuasive from the LLM evalua-\ntor’s perspective, many persuadees remain uncon-\nvinced when judged according to human reasoning.\nThese results demonstrate the validity of our evalu-\nation method and highlight the lack of authenticity\nin the LLM-generated dataset.\nAddressing these challenges is essential for de-\nveloping AI-driven persuasion systems that more\naccurately reflect real human dialogue dynamics.\nTo this end, we take three key steps to enhance\nthe authenticity and logical coherence of persua-\n\n\nsive dialogue generation: (1) We introduce a novel\ndataset evaluation method based on causal the-\nory of mind, in which the LLM first infers the\npersuadee’s belief and desire from the conversa-\ntion, then assesses whether the persuader success-\nfully addresses them. When applied to human\ndialogue datasets, this method yields results con-\nsistent with direct prompting, where the LLM di-\nrectly determines whether the persuadee was per-\nsuaded. However, when tested on LLM-generated\ndatasets, a significant discrepancy emerges, reveal-\ning a critical gap between model-generated persua-\nsion and real human interactions. (2) We present\nToMMA, a multi-agent framework for generating\npersuasive dialogue datasets. ToMMA ensures that\nboth the persuader and persuadee operate under\ndouble-blind conditions, preventing information\nleakage and maintaining the natural uncertainty\ninherent in real conversations. Furthermore, the\nentire multi-turn dialogue is guided by causal the-\nory of mind, enabling the persuader to construct\narguments based on an inferred understanding of\nthe persuadee’s psychological state, thus foster-\ning more human-like persuasion dynamics. (3)\nWe introduce CToMPersu, a large-scale, multi-\ndomain, multi-turn persuasive dialogue dataset\ncomprising 6,275 dialogues across 35 domains and\n6,257 unique scenarios. This dataset effectively\naddresses double-blind constraints and resolves di-\nalogue logic inconsistencies, demonstrating strong\nperformance across multiple evaluation metrics and\nachieving superior alignment with real human dia-\nlogues.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nPersuasion\nPersuasion Systems\nPersuasive dialogue has\nbeen a long-standing area of interest, particularly\nfocusing on the application of persuasion strate-\ngies (Joshi et al., 2024; Srba et al., 2024; Rogiers\net al., 2024). Since the emergence of large lan-\nguage models, some studies have tested their capa-\nbilities in public health (Altay et al., 2023), politics\n(Potter et al., 2024), and product recommendations\n(Chen et al., 2023). Other work has examined the\nimpact of personality on LLM persuasion (Lou\nand Xu, 2025). Some research has primarily con-\ncentrated on strategy detection (Jin et al., 2023).\nHowever, compelling arguments might be more\nimportant than the strategies themselves, as they di-\nrectly impact the persuadee’s decision-making pro-\ncess. Some works study credibility of arguments\nused in persuasive dialogues. Methods such as self-\nchecking and retrieval-based techniques have been\ndeveloped to ensure that arguments are credible\n(Furumai et al., 2024; Qin et al., 2024). There are\nalso studies dedicated to designing scoring systems\nto identify arguments that can strengthen one’s own\nviewpoint (Saenger et al., 2024). There is also work\nthat studies how LLM can persuade users with\ndifferent personalities on social media. However,\nthese methods often come with longer response\ntimes and still fail to make argument choices that\nare tailored to the persuadee’s mental state, po-\ntentially reducing the overall effectiveness of the\npersuasion process.\nPersuasion Datasets\nRegarding datasets, there is\na growing focus on domains like charity donations\n(Wang et al., 2019), recommendation systems (Li\net al., 2018), and medical dialogues (Zeng et al.,\n2020). Moreover, some work has focused on in-\ntention detection within these datasets, aiming to\nidentify underlying motives during persuasive dia-\nlogues (Sakurai and Miyao, 2024). Datasets such\nas PersuasionForGood and MedDialog have pro-\nvided small-scale real-world dialogues, but they are\nlimited in size and scope. Recent study created a\nlarge-scale, multi-domain datasets called DailyPer-\nsuasion, which offer a more diverse set of conver-\nsational patterns (Jin et al., 2024). However, there\nremain several challenges in aligning these datasets\nwith human-like dialogue dynamics and ensuring\nlogical consistency throughout the conversations.\n2.2\nTheory of Mind\nToM in Psychology\nTheory of Mind (ToM) is\nthe ability to understand others by attributing men-\ntal states, recognizing that their beliefs, desires,\nand thoughts may differ from one’s own (Premack\nand Woodruff, 1978). Based on this theory, psy-\nchologists have developed models such as the BDI\nModel (Georgeff et al., 1999) and Causal ToM (Wu\net al., 2024b), which explain how people interact\nwith others in society, predict their actions, and\neven influence their decisions. Additionally, psy-\nchological tests, such as False Belief Tasks (Baron-\nCohen et al., 1985), have been designed to assess\nwhether individuals possess Theory of Mind.\nToM and LLM\nIn recent years, the Theory of\n\n\nMind capabilities of large language models have\nbeen a subject of research. Some studies have de-\nsigned benchmarks, such as ToMi (Le et al., 2019)\nand FANToM (Kim et al., 2023), to test LLMs’\nToM abilities, building on the psychological False\nBelief Tasks (Chen et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2023;\nTan et al., 2024). Furthermore, other works have\nextended these tasks by incorporating the mental\nstates of characters in the stories, such as OpenToM\n(Xu et al., 2024). There are also efforts to repre-\nsent ToM as a knowledge graph-based dataset (Wu\net al., 2024a). There is also a work that annotates\nthe mental state of people in each round of dialogue\non the negotiation dataset to test the ToM ability of\nLLMs (Chan et al., 2024). Recently, some research\nhas incorporated real-world human behaviors and\nthe underlying mental states as evaluation metrics\nfor LLM ToM within benchmarks (Gu et al., 2024).\nIn addition, there are works exploring ways to im-\nprove the ToM abilities of LLMs, such as by letting\nLLMs understand who can perceive what events,\nor by breaking down the stories in the task into\nsmaller parts based on the order of events (Wilf\net al., 2024; Hou et al., 2024; Tang and Belle, 2024;\nLin et al., 2024; Jung et al., 2024; Sclar et al., 2023).\nThere are also works that exploit multi-agent and\nToM capabilities to complete complex tasks and\ngames (Yim et al., 2024; Cross et al., 2024; Li et al.,\n2023). These works suggest that the integration of\nLLMs with ToM holds great potential for future\nresearch.\n3\nToMMA\nTo address the challenges of maintaining double-\nblind conditions and aligning persuasive dialogue\nlogic, we propose ToMMA, a framework for gener-\nating dialogue datasets guided by causal theory of\nmind and employing a multi-agent approach. As\nshown in Fig. 3, the process unfolds in three stages:\nFirst, we filter scenarios from DailyPersuasion, re-\ntaining unique tags and generating the persuadee’s\nmental state. In the second step, we design per-\nsuader and persuadee agents without shared infor-\nmation, ensuring that both agents follow causal\ntheory of mind to generate persuasive dialogues.\nFinally, to maintain the quality of the dataset, we\nintroduce an observer agent that reviews the per-\nsuader’s inferences and persuasive statements, of-\nfering suggestions for improvement. This multi-\nstep process guarantees the generation of a diverse\nand high-quality CToMPersu dataset, which pre-\nserves double-blind conditions while aligning with\nhuman-like persuasion dynamics.\n3.1\nCausal Theory of Mind\nAs illustrated in Fig. 2, Causal Theory of Mind\nrefers to the use of Theory of Mind to influence\nothers’ behaviors. To prevent unwanted actions,\nit is sufficient to alter the other person’s belief or\ndesire. For instance, informing someone that the\npost office is closed or removing their need to send\na letter can prevent them from going. Conversely,\nto encourage someone to take a specific action,\nboth their belief and desire must be addressed. For\nexample, to persuade someone to go to the post\noffice, they must believe it is open and have the\nneed to send a letter (Wu et al., 2024b).\nIn real-world persuasion, the persuader is aware\nof both what they want and do not want the per-\nsuadee to do. Their objective is to understand the\npersuadee’s mental state—specifically, their beliefs\nand desires. This understanding enables the per-\nsuader to tailor their approach and effectively guide\nthe persuadee toward the desired outcome.\n3.2\nImportant Contents\nBased on the definition of causal theory of mind\n(Wu et al., 2024b) and our design tailored for the\npersuasion domain, we have derived the following\nfour definitions. These will serve as prompts at\neach step, not only assisting GPT in generating\nmental states but also helping both the persuader\nand persuadee agents organize their dialogue.\nPreventative Preventative Behavior refers to ac-\ntions the persuadee desires to take, which often\nconflict with generative behavior. Therefore, the\npersuader’s goal is to prevent the persuadee from\nengaging in these behaviors.\nGenerative Generative Behavior represents actions\nthe persuader wants the persuadee to take. These\nbehaviors are the persuader’s goal.\nBelief For preventative behavior, the persuadee\nshould hold a positive belief, as recognizing the\nfacts as positive tends to encourage engagement in\nthe behavior. Conversely, for generative behavior,\nthe persuadee should hold a negative belief, as per-\nceiving the current situation as unfavorable initially\ndiscourages engagement in the behavior.\nDesire For both preventative and generative behav-\niors, the persuadee should have a positive desire.\n\n\nFigure 3: Overview of the ToMMA framework for collecting the CToMPersu dataset. This figue illustrates the\nthree-step process: (1) Mental State Generation, (2) Dialogue Generation Guided by Causal Theory of Mind, and\n(3) Observer Interaction for quality control.\nThis is because we believe that if the persuadee\ninitially holds a negative desire toward generative\nbehavior, the entire premise of persuasion would be\nundermined. The key difference lies in the expecta-\ntion of desire fulfillment: for preventative behavior,\nthe persuadee believes their desire will be satisfied\nonce the action is taken. In contrast, for generative\nbehavior, the persuadee may be uncertain whether\ntheir desire can be satisfied or may doubt its fulfill-\nment.\n3.3\nMental State Generation\nTo ensure topic diversity, we adopt the scenario\nsetup from DailyPersuasion, filtering for unique\nscenarios, which results in a total of 6,257 distinct\nscenarios. Next, we generate the behavioral inten-\ntions of the persuadee based on the background and\nprompts from each scenario. We define Generative\nBehavior and Preventative Behavior using a large\nlanguage model (GPT-4o in this case), guided by a\ncarefully designed prompt. Additionally, in cases\nwhere the persuadee does not have any specific in-\ntention to act (i.e., they lack a pre-set stance), only\nGenerative Behavior is generated, while Preventa-\ntive Behavior is set to \"None.\" We then generate\nthe persuadee’s Belief and Desire, based on the sce-\nnario and the identified Generative and Preventative\nBehavior. Finally, the generated Belief and Desire\nform the persuadee’s mental state for each scenario,\nwhich serves as the foundation for the subsequent\nsteps in the persuasive dialogue generation process.\n3.4\nConversation Generation\nThe core of ToMMA revolves around generating\nthe dialogue between two agents: the persuader\nand the persuadee. As shown in Fig. 3, both agents\nshare the same information about the scenario, but\nthe persuader does not have direct access to the\npersuadee’s mental state.\nPrompt Design To ensure the quality of the dataset,\nwe set a limit on the number of dialogue rounds. If\nthe persuadee’s mental state involves only Genera-\ntive Behavior, the interaction is limited to 3 rounds,\nresulting in 6 utterances. The dialogue begins with\nthe persuader presenting their viewpoint and ask-\ning the persuadee about their belief regarding the\nGenerative Behavior. The persuadee then reveals\naspects of their mental state. Next, prompting the\npersuader to update their understanding of the per-\nsuadee’s mental state and address any concerns\nrelated to the persuadee’s belief. In the subsequent\nround, the persuadee discloses their desire, and\nthe persuader again updates their model of the per-\nsuadee’s mental state, responding in a way that\nsatisfies the persuadee’s desire. The conversation\nconcludes with the persuadee’s final statement.\nIf both Preventative and Generative Behavior are\npresent in the persuadee’s mental state, the num-\nber of rounds is set to 4, resulting in 8 utterances.\nThe first round will focus on addressing the per-\nsuadee’s belief or desire regarding the Preventative\nBehavior, while the remaining rounds will follow\nthe same pattern as outlined above. We have de-\n\n\nsigned specific prompts for each round, tailored to\nboth agents.\nPersuadee Agent\nThe role of the persuadee is\nrelatively simpler. Their available information in-\ncludes the scenario and their mental state, which\nconsists of beliefs and desires. The persuadee also\nhas access to the conversation history, which in-\nforms their responses. In the context of persuasion,\nwe assume that both parties aim to resolve the issue\nat hand, rather than engaging in a debate. Conse-\nquently, the persuadee is more likely to explicitly\nexpress their thoughts and concerns.\nPersuader Agent\nThe persuader’s task is more\ncomplex. Their available information includes the\nscenario, but they do not have direct access to the\npersuadee’s mental state. To initiate the conversa-\ntion, the persuader subtly probes the persuadee’s\nbeliefs and desires. As the dialogue progresses,\nthe persuader uses the conversation history and the\npersuadee’s responses to infer their mental state.\nThis process involves leveraging Theory of Mind\nto model the persuadee’s beliefs and desires.\nOnce the persuader has developed an understand-\ning of the persuadee’s mental state, they craft cus-\ntomized persuasive strategies. According to Causal\nTheory of Mind, when addressing Preventative Be-\nhavior, the persuader focuses on influencing the be-\nlief or desire that is more responsive to persuasion,\ndepending on which aspect is easier to change. For\nGenerative Behavior, the persuader must address\nboth the belief and the desire in order to align with\nthe persuadee’s motivations and influence their de-\ncision. Fig. 4 illustrates the prompt design used\nby the persuader in the third round of dialogue.\nAt this stage, the persuader has addressed the per-\nsuadee’s beliefs regarding Preventative Behavior,\nand the persuadee has introduced a negative be-\nlief regarding Generative Behavior, which the per-\nsuader needs to resolve.\n3.5\nObserver Interaction\nDuring the data generation process, we observed\nthat while the persuadee does not intentionally\nconceal or mislead the persuader, the persuader\nmay still incorrectly infer the persuadee’s men-\ntal state. These incorrect inferences can lead the\npersuader down the wrong path in the persuasion\nprocess, resulting in logical inconsistencies in the\ndialogue. To address this issue, we introduce the\nObserver Agent. Fig. 5 illustrates a successful\nFigure 4: 3rd Round Persuader Response Prompt De-\nsign\ncase study where the Observer Agent’s suggestions\ncontributed to the improvement of dataset quality.\nThe Observer Agent plays a critical role in en-\nsuring the quality and logical coherence of the per-\nsuasive dialogue. As shown in Fig. 3, it evaluates\nthe persuader’s inferences and responses. If the\nObserver determines that the persuader’s response\nis sufficiently accurate, it does not provide any sug-\ngestions. However, if the response is deemed inad-\nequate, the Observer offers feedback and sugges-\ntions to help the persuader refine their response,\nthereby improving the quality and logical consis-\ntency of the dialogue and the generated dataset.\n4\nExperiments\nIn the experimental section, we demonstrate how\nour dataset compares with other human and LLM-\ngenerated datasets using conventional evaluation\nmethods, as well as its consistency in both Causal\nTheory of Mind Evaluation and Direct Prompting.\nAdditionally, we categorize the experiments into\nFixed and Dynamic Persuadee categories to test the\npersuasive capabilities of existing large models.\n4.1\nDataset Evaluation\nTo assess the quality of CToMPersu, we compared\nit to a real human dialogue dataset, PersuasionFor-\nGood, a small-scale dataset consisting of real con-\n\n\nversations focused on persuading people to donate.\nWe also compared it to DailyPersuasion, a large-\nscale, multi-domain, multi-turn dialogue dataset\ngenerated by GPT-4.\nMetric\nPersuForGood\nDailyPersu\nCToMPersu\nContext-Coherence\n4.29\n4.97\n4.97\nLogical-Coherence\n4.14\n4.98\n4.97\nHelpfulness\n3.86\n4.87\n4.93\nDirect Prompting\n88.87\n90.75\n90.82\nCausal ToM Eval\n79.87\n54.80\n82.02\nTable 1: Comparison between PersuasionForGood,\nDailyPersu, and CToMPersu datasets.\nMetrics\nWe apply five key evaluation metrics to\ncompare the datasets, of which the first three are\nbased on a multi-turn dialogue evaluation method\n(Sun et al., 2024). All of these metrics are evaluated\nby GPT-3.5 : 1) Context-Coherence This metric\nassesses the coherence of the context across multi-\nple dialogue turns, based on the LLM’s judgment\nof the conversation’s flow. 2) Logical-Coherence\nThis evaluates the logical consistency of the di-\nalogue, ensuring that each turn is logically con-\nsistent with the previous context. 3) Helpfulness\nThis measures whether the persuader’s responses\nare effective in helping the persuadee achieve per-\nsuasion. 4) Direct Prompting In this metric, we\nprompt the LLM to play the role of the persuadee,\nreading the dialogue and determining whether they\nfeel persuaded. This serves as a direct measure of\nthe dialogue’s persuasive effectiveness. 5) Causal\nToM Eval This metric evaluates whether the per-\nsuadee’s mental state was adequately inferred and\naddressed, in line with the Causal Theory of Mind\nevaluation method.\nThe experimental results in Tab. 1 show that, un-\nder some conventional metrics, the LLM-generated\ndatasets achieve a high level of performance, with\nscores approaching perfection. This may be influ-\nenced by GPT evaluators’ preference for responses\ngenerated by larger models. However, in the Causal\nToM Eval results, the performance of CToMPersu\nis more similar to that of the human dataset, with\nonly an -8.8 point difference. This suggests that\nthe dataset generated using ToMMA aligns more\nclosely with the persuasive logic of human conver-\nsations. It also highlights that relying solely on\ngeneral multi-turn dialogue evaluation metrics is\ninsufficient for accurately assessing the dataset.\n4.2\nExperimental Results\nSetup: For evaluation purposes, we separated the\ntest set using a specific ratio. The domain distri-\nbution is shown in Tab. C. We evaluated the per-\nformance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o\non CToMPersu. The evaluation was divided into\ntwo tests: the Fixed Persuadee test, in which the\nLLM predicts the next response of the persuader\nstarting from a specific dialogue round within dif-\nferent scenarios from the dataset; and the Dynamic\nPersuadee test, where the persuadee, played by\nGPT-4o, interacts with the persuader, played by\nanother LLM, based on the scenario and mental\nstate components.\nFixed Persuadee Evaluation: We fixed the dia-\nlogues up to the third round, as the persuader’s\nresponse in this round is crucial, regardless of\nwhether the persuasive dialogue includes Preventa-\ntive Behavior. The previous dialogues provide the\nhistorical context for the persuader agent. Rouge-L\nrefers to the Rouge value between the model’s pre-\ndictions and the golden label. Persuasive is based\non (Furumai et al., 2024), where GPT-3.5 uses both\nthe historical dialogue and the current prediction to\ndetermine whether the prediction aims to change\nthe persuadee’s mind. A score is then assigned on\na scale from 1 to 10 based on this evaluation.\nDynamic Persuadee Evaluation: In the dynamic\npersuadee evaluation, we set up a persuadee to en-\ngage in a dialogue with the persuader, followed\nby an assessment of the outcome. The persuadee\nuses the mental state data from the dataset to guide\nthe dialogue generation. For evaluation, we con-\nsider several aspects. Persuasive is evaluated as\ndescribed above. Preventative Satisfaction asks\nGPT to evaluate whether, as the persuadee, it feels\nthat the dialogue satisfies the requirements for pre-\nventative behavior. Similarly, Generative Satis-\nfaction assesses the degree to which the dialogue\nmeets the persuadee’s needs for generative behav-\nior. CToM Eval combines the results of Preventa-\ntive and Generative Satisfaction to assess whether\nthe persuader has successfully persuaded the per-\nsuadee.\nFrom the results in Tab. 2, we observe that for\nthe fixed persuadee evaluation, GPT-4o performs\nthe best in both the Rouge score and the Persuasive\nevaluation. This indicates that GPT-4o has supe-\nrior persuasive capabilities compared to the other\n\n\nModel\nFixed Persuadee\nDynamic Persuadee\nRouge-L\nPersuasive\nPersuasive\nPreventative\nGenerative\nCToM\nGPT-3.5\n0.2813\n7.94\n7.87\n33.14\n28.38\n15.05\nGPT-4o-mini\n0.2872\n8.07\n8.08\n37.71\n16.76\n12.57\nGPT-4o\n0.2899\n8.17\n8.06\n42.67\n17.90\n13.33\nTable 2: Evaluation of Different Models in Fixed and Dynamic Persuadee Evaluation.\nmodels. Moreover, with the Persuasive evaluation\nrange extending up to a maximum score of 10, the\nhighest current score is only 8.17, suggesting that\nthere is still significant room for improvement in\nLLMs. In the dynamic persuadee evaluation, GPT-\n4o-mini and GPT-4o perform well in the Persuasive\nevaluation. GPT-4o performs the best in Preventa-\ntive Satisfaction, which may indicate that GPT-4o\nis more effective at discouraging actions. How-\never, GPT-3.5 excels in Generative Satisfaction and\nCToM Eval, suggesting that it may be better at\nconvincing someone to take action. This could be\ninfluenced by the design of the prompt and the num-\nber of turns set in the evaluation. Specifically, the\nLLM persuadee might fail to adequately respond\nto the Generative Behavior, resulting in a lower\nscore. This could also influence the CToM score.\nAdditionally, the overall low success rate (less than\n50%) highlights some limitations of LLMs in The-\nory of Mind, as they struggle to accurately infer\nand persuade the other party’s mental state without\nexplicit prompting.\n4.3\nObserver Agent Case Study\nAt times, the persuader agent may misjudge or\nmake errors in predicting the persuadee agent’s\nmental state. For instance, as illustrated in Fig.\n5, the persuader was expected to address the per-\nsuadee’s desire regarding Generative Behavior,\nsince the belief had already been resolved in the\nprevious round. However, when the persuadee\nagent expressed their desire, it included the phrase\n\"within my budget,\" which corresponded to a belief\nthat had already been addressed. The true desire,\nhowever, was simply \"hope for relaxation.\" As a\nresult, the persuader agent mistakenly incorporated\nthe budget constraint into their assessment of the\ndesire, leading to a response that overly focused on\nthe budget. This diminished the effectiveness of\nthe persuasion, as the response should have primar-\nily addressed the \"relaxation\" aspect. Ultimately,\nwith guidance from the Observer Agent, the per-\nsuader corrected their prediction of the desire and\nFigure 5: An example demonstrating the effectiveness\nof the observer agent. In this round, the persuader is sup-\nposed to address the desire. However, both the mental\nstate prediction and the persuasive dialogue generation\nincorrectly focus too much on belief. In the end, the\nentire issue is resolved by the observer agent.\ngenerated a more targeted response, avoiding un-\nnecessary discussion about the budget.\n5\nConclusion\nIn this work, we addresses key challenges in de-\nveloping AI-driven persuasion systems that more\nclosely align with real human dialogue dynamics.\nWe introduce a novel evaluation method based on\ncausal theory of mind, enabling the LLM to infer\nand address the persuadee’s beliefs and desires.\nThrough the development of ToMMA, a multi-\nagent framework, we ensure double-blind condi-\ntions and guide persuasive dialogues with causal\nreasoning, leading to more human-like interactions.\nAdditionally, we present CToMPersu, a large-scale,\nmulti-domain dataset that effectively addresses log-\nical inconsistencies and demonstrates strong align-\nment with human dialogues, marking a significant\nadvancement in realistic persuasive dialogue gener-\nation.\n\n\nLimitations\nIn addition to aligning the dialogue content in the\ndataset with human logic through Theory of Mind,\nseveral enhancements can also be implemented.\nFor example, combining the selection of arguments\nwith prompts related to the persuader’s strategy can\nhelp ensure that the persuasive responses gener-\nated by the persuader are not only relevant to the\npersuadee’s interests but also more convincing and\ndiverse. Furthermore, defining the persuadee’s per-\nsonality can also be implemented, as persuadees\nwith different personalities may have distinct ways\nof responding. For instance, some persuadees may\ndirectly express their thoughts, while others may\ntend to conceal them. These improvements can be\nseamlessly incorporated into the ToMMA frame-\nwork for data generation, leading to more diverse\nand realistic scenarios.\nEthics Statement\nPersuasion is a powerful tool that can be used for\nsocially beneficial purposes, such as charitable do-\nnations and medical consultations, fostering pos-\nitive developments within human society. How-\never, it can also be misused for malicious activities,\nsuch as spreading harmful content or influencing\nsocial media narratives negatively. To ensure the\nresponsible use of persuasion, it is essential to care-\nfully manage the topics and content involved. The\nCToMPersu dataset is designed around safe, un-\nbiased topics, with the goal of promoting positive\nsocietal impacts. All scenarios within the dataset\nare carefully curated to avoid sensitive or harmful\ncontent, ensuring that the generated dialogues align\nwith ethical standards. Our data set does not in-\nclude any input or output from the user profile that\ncould lead to privacy breaches. Before the public\nrelease of the dataset, we will conduct a thorough\ninternal review to ensure compliance with ethical\nand legal standards. We will continue to monitor\nthe use of the dataset to ensure it is used for posi-\ntive and constructive purposes, in line with ethical\nresearch and societal benefits.\nReferences\nSacha Altay, Anne-Sophie Hacquin, Coralie Chevallier,\nand Hugo Mercier. 2023.

This paper proposes a novel Hypergraph Multi-Modal Learning\nFramework (Hyper-MML), designed to effectively identify emotions in conversation by integrating\nEEG with audio and video information to capture complex emotional dynamics.

Recent research suggests that individuals with these conditions frequently exhibit\nunique communication challenges, including speech impairments, emotional disturbances, literal interpretation of\nquestions, and difficulty sustaining coherent dialogue [1]. Current research in ERC primarily focuses on textual analysis,\nsupplemented by visual cues like facial expressions and acoustic cues such as intonation and loudness [2]. These\nmethods typically rely on complete, uninterrupted texts or dialogue transcripts, integrating multi-modal data to provide\ncontext for individual utterances. Context modeling in ERC generally incorporates three key elements: 1) the content of\npreceding exchanges, 2) the timing of conversational turns, and 3) speaker-specific details such as identity and evolving\nemotional states [4, 5]. However, disruptions in the textual flow – such as fragmented sentences or missing dialogue\nsegments – can break the semantic structure and distort logical relationships between utterances. This incoherence\nreduces the accuracy of emotion recognition, limiting its practical applications in diagnosing and treating conditions\nlike autism and depression. To address these limitations, psychotherapists need alternative indicators that remain robust\neven when conversational data is imperfect.\nPhysiological signals – particularly electroencephalogram (EEG) data – provide a direct window into neural activity\nand emotional states, surpassing text-based methods in objectivity and immediacy [3, 18]. While textual analysis\n∗⋆: Zijian Kang and Yueyang Li are co-first authors. †: Weiming Zeng and Nizhuan Wang are corresponding authors.

By integrating EEG signals with\ntext-based modalities, clinicians can address key limitations of language-driven approaches, such as distortions caused\nby fragmented or incomplete dialogue. EEG’s language-independent nature avoids language-related biases, enabling\nclearer and more objective emotion measurement. Furthermore, combining EEG with multi-modal data (e.g., audio and\nvideo) outperforms single-source EEG analysis, enhancing diagnostic accuracy [14]. This integrative framework allows\npsychologists to correlate physiological responses (e.g., brainwave patterns) with behavioural cues (e.g. voice tone,\nfacial expressions), constructing a comprehensive emotional profile. These insights support the development of tailored\ntreatment strategies that better address individual patient needs.\nIn multi-modal dialogue recognition tasks, a standard approach involves using graph neural networks (GNNs) to\nmodel interactions by capturing contextual and multi-modal data (e.g., text, audio, visual). However, GNNs face a\ncritical limitation: they can only model complex interactions by chaining together simple pairwise relationships (e.g.,\nbetween two nodes at a time). This sequential approximation of high-order relationships – such as group dynamics\nor multi-modal dependencies – often leads to suboptimal accuracy. Hypergraph theory overcomes this limitation\nby natively supporting high-order connections (e.g., linking three or more nodes simultaneously), enabling direct\nmodeling of intricate multi-modal interactions. For instance, a hyperedge could connect a speaker’s utterance, their\nfacial expression, and a listener’s reaction in a signle interaction step. This capability makes hypergraphs a more precise\nand efficient framework for multi-modal dialogue analysis [7].\nIn this study, we propose a novel Hypergraph Multi-Modal Learning framework (Hyper-MML) centered on EEG\nsignals, which has been validated as a state-of-the-art (SOTA) method on the EAV dataset [8]. Our framework advances\nERC through two key innovations:\n1) Hypergraph Multi-Modal Learning Framework (Hyper-MML): We introduce an end-to-end architecture that\nintegrates EEG signals with audio and visual data to model complex emotional dynamics (e.g., shifts between\nfrustration, surprise, or relief) in conversations. Unlike traditional text-centric approaches, Hyper-MML directly\nleverages physiological (EEG) and behavioral (audio-visual) cues, bypassing the limitations of language-based ambiguity\nor incomplete dialogue transcripts.\n2) Multi-modal Hypergraph Fusion Module (MHFM): A specialized module that enhances cross-modal interaction\n(EEG-audio-video) within hypergraph structures. This module employs adaptive weighted aggregation to dynamically\nprioritize the most informative modalities (e.g., emphasizing EEG during subtle emotional shifts or audio during\ntone-based cues). This strategy optimizes information propagation across modalities, significantly improving emotion\nrecognition accuracy.\n2\n\n\nPRIME AI paper\n2\nMethod\n2.1\nProblem Definition\nThe EEG-based ERC aims to infer the emotional state of each incomplete semantic segment of utterances. For each\ncomplete utterance, we segment it into N segments {s1, s2, ..., sN}, where each segment involves three sources of\nsegment-aligned data corresponding to three modalities: EEG (se\ni), audio (sa\ni ), and video (sv\ni ), represented as follows:\nsi = {se\ni, sa\ni , sv\ni }\n(1)\nThe objective of EEG-based ERC task is to predict the emotional category of each fragment si from a predefined set\nof C emotional categories, i.e., Happy, Sad, Calm, Angry and Neutral. Figure 1 illustrates the proposed Hyper-MML\nframework based on EEG-audio-video triplets. In general, the Hyper-MML consists of three key modules: Unimodality\nEncoders, Multi-modal Hypergraph Fusion Module and Emotion Classifier.\n2.2\nUnimodality Encoders\nEffectively capturing contextual information between utterance segments is challenging due to incomplete semantic\ndata. To address this, we propose extracting short-context-window embeddings within each of three modalities (EEG,\naudio, video) at the segment level. For EEG signals, which reflect instantaneous neural activity, our focus lies in\nextracting temporal features and dynamic patterns to capture rapid emotional shifts.\n1) Acoustic and Visual Embedding: For audio and video modalities, we used established fully connected networks\n[9, 10] as encoders. The short-context-aware feature encoding for each segment can be formulated as follows:\nva\ni = W1f a\ni + ba\ni , vv\ni = W2f v\ni + bv\ni\n(2)\nwhere f a\ni , f v\ni are the context-independent raw feature of segment i from the audio and video modalities, respectively.\nThe raw audio features f a\ni are extracted using the openSMILE toolkit with the IS10 configuration [9] from the\naudios, while the raw facial expressions features f v\ni are extracted using a pre-trained MA-NET [10] from the videos.\nThe unimodality encoder for each audio and video outputs the short-context-aware raw feature embedding va\ni , vv\ni\naccordingly.\n2) EEG Embedding: For EEG signals, to capture effective subject-specific information, we use a specialized EEG\nencoder NESTA that jointly learns subject-specific channel transformations and adaptively captures spectral patterns\nwhile preserving key temporal-spectral information within the EEG signals [11].\nve\ni = NESTA(sa\ni )\n(3)\n2.3\nMulti-modal Hypergraph Fusion Module (MHFM)\nCurrent approaches to ERC often simplify cross-modal interactions by modeling them as pairwise relationships\n(e.g., audio-text or video-text). In our study, our MHFM uses hypergraphs to directly capture complex higher-order\nrelationships (e.g., simultaneous EEG-audio-video dependencies), which better reflect the group dynamics of multi-\nmodal emotional cues. Furthermore, since each modality contributes uniquely to detecting instantaneous emotional\nshifts, we integrate learnable modality-specific weights. These weights are dynamically adjusted during training to\nprioritize the most informative modalities.\n1) Hypergraph Construction: Generally, a conversation with N utterance segments can be reformulated as a hypergraph\nH = (VH, EH), in which each node v ∈VH corresponds to a unimodal segment, and every hyperedge e ∈EH encodes\nmultimodal or contextual dependencies. Let I ∈R|VH|×|EH| represent the incident matrix, in which a nonzero entry\nIve = 1 indicates that the hyperedge e is incident with the node v; otherwise Ive = 0. Each segment is represented by\nthree nodes, i.e., ve\ni , va\ni , vv\ni , in the hypergraph, corresponding to EEG, audio and video modalities, respectively.\nTo capture relationships that extend beyond pairwise interactions in multi-modal emotion recognition based on utterance\nsegments, the complex multi-modal relationships of each utterance segment are constructed as hyperedges. Each node\nvx\ni (x ∈{e, a, v}) is connected to other modalities of the same utterance segment {vy\ni |y ̸= x, y ∈{e, a, v}}, forming\na multi-modal hyperedge em. Additionally, we connect EEG signals {ve\ni |i ∈[1, N]} from different segments of the\nsame utterance to create short-context hyperedges ec. The hyperedges EH are therefore divided into two subsets: the\nmulti-modal hyperedge set Em and the contextual hyperedge set Ec. This approach enables the constructed hypergraph\nto capture higher-order mutual information and contextual information between multi-modal data, thereby transcending\nthe limitations of pairwise interactions.\n3\n\n\nPRIME AI paper\nInspired by the hypergraph study of edge-dependent vertex weights [12], we set different node weights for multi-\nmodal hyperedges and context-dependent nodes, aiming to distinguish the contributions of modality nodes to different\nrelational patterns. Therefore, the edge-dependent vertex weights can be represented by a weighted incidence matrix:\nˆHij =\n\n\n\nγm(ej),\nif vi ∈ej and ej ∈Em;\nγc(ej),\nif vi ∈ej and ej ∈Ec;\n0,\notherwise.\n(4)\nin which γm(ej) is the multi-modal edge-dependent vertex weights, while γc(ej) is the context edge-dependent vertex\nweights. Analogously, the hyperedge weight matrix can be defined as follow:\nWe = diag(wm(e1), ..., wm(e|Em|), wc(e1), ..., wc(e|Ec|))\n(5)\nwhere wm(ei) and wc(ei) is the multi-modal hyperedge weight and the context hyperedge weight, respectively.\n2) Hypergraph Feature Fusion: Inspired by M 3Net [6], the core of MHFM involves a hypergraph convolution\noperation that propagates multivariate embeddings across the hypergraph. In this operation, we dynamically adjust the\nimportance of each modality through learnable weights, enabling the model to prioritize the most relevant features for\nemotion recognition tasks. This flexibility allows MHFM to adaptively capture the complex interactions and contextual\nrelationships inherent in multi-modal data.\nMathematically, the module updates the embeddings based on the aggregated features of neighboring nodes, enhancing\nthe representation of each modality while maintaining the integrity of the hypergraph structure. The formula for MHFM\nis as follows:\nV (l+1) = σ\n\u0010\nD−1\nH IWeB−1\nH ˆHT V (l)\u0011\n(6)\nin which V (l) = {vx\ni,(l)|i ∈[1, N], x ∈{e, a, v}} ∈RVH×EH is the input at layer l. σ is the non-linear activation\nfunction. DH ∈R|VH|×|VH| is the node degree matrix used to normalize node features. BH ∈R|EH|×|EH| and\nhyperedge degree matrix that reflects the connectivity of hyperedges. After performing L iterations, we get the outputs\nof the last iteration vx\ni,(L) as the multivariate representations:\n¯ve\ni = ve\ni,(L),\n¯va\ni = va\ni,(L),\n¯vv\ni = vv\ni,(L)\n(7)\nFinally, we concatenate the embeddings of three modalities to obtain the emotional embedding of the utterance segment\nas follow:\nei = ¯ve\ni ⊕¯va\ni ⊕¯vv\ni\n(8)\n3) Emotion Classification: The emotion classifier takes as input the concatenated multivariate representations to\nperform emotion prediction. Referring to prior works [5], we finally feed ei into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with\nfully connected layers to predict the emotion label ˆyi for the segment:\nli = ReLU(Wlei + bl),\n(9)\nPi = softmax(Wsmaxli + bsmax),\n(10)\nˆyi = arg max\nτ (Pi[τ])\n(11)\nin which li is the output of the hidden layer after applying the ReLU activation function, Wl and bl are the weight\nmatrix and bias vector for the input layer, respectively. Pi denotes the probability distribution over the emotion classes,\nwith Wsmax and bsmax representing the weight matrix and bias vector for the output layer. Finally, ˆyi is the predicted\nemotion label for the utterance segment. We use categorical cross-entropy along with L2-regularization as the loss\nfunction during training, following the work [15]:\nL = −\n1\nPN\ns=1 c(s)\nN\nX\ni=1\nc(i)\nX\nj=1\nlog Pi,j[yi,j] + λ∥θ∥2\n(12)\nwhere N represents the number of dialogues, c(i) denotes the number of utterance segments within dialogue i.\nAdditionally, Pi,j refers to the probability distribution of class labels, while yi,j indicates the ground-truth label for\nsegment j in the dialogue i. The parameter λ is used as the weight for L2-regularization, and θ represents the parameters\nthat can be trained in the model.\n4\n\n\nPRIME AI paper\nTable 1: Accuracy and F1-score compared with baseline. * indicates significant improvement over AMERL (p < 0.05).\nMethod\nMethod\nAMERL\nOurs\nAMERL\nOurs\nsubject\nACC(%)\nF1(%)\nACC(%)\nF1(%)\nsubject\nACC(%)\nF1(%)\nACC(%)\nF1(%)\n1\n66.60\n-\n67.50\n67.15\n22\n76.37\n-\n81.67\n81.71\n2\n76.27\n-\n85.00\n84.89\n23\n64.63\n-\n78.33\n77.77\n3\n75.43\n-\n85.83\n86.06\n24\n85.13\n-\n85.83\n85.66\n4\n81.83\n-\n83.33\n82.17\n25\n67.73\n-\n74.17\n74.68\n5\n59.47\n-\n70.83\n69.62\n26\n68.57\n-\n70.83\n70.17\n6\n69.73\n-\n80.00\n79.58\n27\n83.87\n-\n85.83\n85.27\n7\n80.43\n-\n81.67\n81.44\n28\n81.17\n-\n83.33\n83.99\n8\n68.97\n-\n74.17\n74.80\n29\n62.53\n-\n69.17\n68.15\n9\n76.43\n-\n83.33\n83.18\n30\n56.10\n-\n80.83\n81.30\n10\n69.37\n-\n70.00\n66.16\n31\n64.30\n-\n84.17\n84.60\n11\n57.03\n-\n75.00\n74.46\n32\n63.83\n-\n65.00\n63.96\n12\n55.17\n-\n76.67\n75.81\n33\n80.10\n-\n83.33\n82.99\n13\n75.27\n-\n84.17\n84.12\n34\n68.20\n-\n70.83\n69.79\n14\n57.97\n-\n70.00\n68.71\n35\n62.97\n-\n67.50\n67.55\n15\n65.53\n-\n85.83\n85.76\n36\n74.23\n-\n74.17\n73.97\n16\n57.83\n-\n70.83\n70.17\n37\n61.83\n-\n62.50\n61.96\n17\n89.63\n-\n99.17\n99.17\n38\n76.27\n-\n85.83\n85.98\n18\n74.97\n-\n76.67\n76.44\n39\n71.50\n-\n76.67\n75.24\n19\n68.10\n-\n71.67\n71.94\n40\n66.90\n-\n70.83\n70.89\n20\n86.50\n-\n92.50\n92.46\n41\n72.33\n-\n76.67\n76.27\n21\n78.10\n-\n87.50\n87.04\n42\n77.10\n-\n78.33\n77.98\nAverage accuracy and F1-score of 42 subjects\n70.86\n-\n76.65*\n76.80\n3\nExperiments and Results\n3.1\nDataset and Experimental Setting\nThe recently released multi-modal dialogue emotion dataset, EAV [8], includes EEG data from 30 channels, audio\nrecordings, and facial expression videos from 42 subjects. This dataset represents the first publicly available collection\nthat integrates EEG, audio, and video in a conversational context. Each subject engaged in 200 interactions within\nprompt-based dialogue scenarios, eliciting five distinct emotions: Neutral, Anger, Happy, Sad and Calm. Each\ninteraction consisted of 20 seconds of listening followed by 20 seconds of speaking. For our evaluation, we focused\nexclusively on the speaking data of the subjects and followed the authors’ preprocessing methods, segmenting the\n20-second speech data stream into 5-second intervals. In addition, the proposed model is implemented using PyTorch\nand torch-geometric packages. The networks are trained with 1 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090. We use accuracy and\nF1-score as the metrics to measure the performance. Paired t-test is performed to test the significance of performance\nimprovement with a default significance level of 0.05. Models are trained using Adam [17] with a batch size of 16.\n3.2\nComparison with Baseline\nTo evaluate Hyper-MML, we compared our framework with the attention-based multi-modal emotion recognition\nframework (AMERL), which utilizes attention mechanisms to dynamically adjust the contributions of different\nmodalities and is currently the only framework that applies multi-modal physiological signals to emotion recognition in\nconversations [13]. Specifically, AMERL uses an attention mechanism to dynamically adjust the attention weights of\nvarious modalities, prioritizing the key features of each modality and adapting to different input sizes. We evaluated\nthe emotion classification accuracy and F1-score of 42 participants, and it is evident that our proposed Hyper-MML\nsignificantly outperformed the previous method on the EAV dataset, achieving new state-of-the-art (SOTA) records.\nThe corresponding results are presented in Table 1.\n3.3\nAblation Studies\nTo better demonstrate the rationale and effectiveness of the proposed model, we conducted an ablation study on the\nkey components of Hyper-MML, with the results presented in Table 2. First, we validated the effectiveness of EEG\nmodality compared to the text modality under conditions of incomplete semantic integrity in the utterance segments.\n5\n\n\nPRIME AI paper\nTable 2: Results of ablation experiments. * indicates significant improvement.

Our experiments\nshowed that the performance of EEG-based multi-modal recognition model outperformed that of the text-based multi-\nmodal recognition model in the emotion recognition task involving incomplete utterance segments. Additionally, we\nverified the effectiveness of our hypergraph fusion module by replacing it with a standard graph convolution module,\nwhich facilitates complex interactions between multiple modalities through several pairwise relationships. Under this\nconfiguration, we observed a decrease in average accuracy by 4.72% on the EAV dataset, and the F1-score similarly\ndropped by 3.97%. This demonstrates the effectiveness of hypergraph modeling to capture higher-order relationships\nbetween modalities and contextual elements.\n4\nConclusion\nIn this study, we introduced the Hypergraph Multi-Modal Learning framework (Hyper-MML) for EEG-based emotion\nrecognition in conversations, addressing the limitations of traditional methods that primarily rely on textual information.\nBy integrating EEG signals with audio and video data, our framework effectively captures the intricate emotional\ndynamics inherent in conversational interactions. The MHFM significantly enhances the model’s ability to process\nand integrate various modalities, leading to a more nuanced understanding of emotional states. Our experiments on\nthe EAV dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework not only improves classification accuracy but also sets new\nbenchmarks in emotion recognition. Future research should explore the generalizability of the Hyper-MML framework\nacross diverse datasets and real-world applications, such as mental health monitoring and human-computer interaction.\nReferences\n[1] Amaia Hervás.

It is\ndifficult to teach these competencies in a classical academic environment.\nThe paper presents a possible approach to teaching in soft and fu-\nture skills in a short, intensive joint project. In our case, it is a project\nwithin the Erasmus+ framework, but it can be organized in many different\nframeworks.\nIn the project we use problem based learning, active learning and\ngroup-work teaching methodologies.\nMoreover, the approach put high\nemphasizes diversity. We arrange a set of multidisciplinary students in\ngroups. Each group is working on software development tasks. This type\nof projects demand diversity, and only a part of the team needs techni-\ncal skills. In our case less than half of participants had computer science\nbackground. Additionally, software development projects are usually in-\nteresting for non-technical students.\nThe multicultural, multidisciplinary and international aspects are very\nimportant in a modern global working environment. On the other hand,\nshort time of the project and its intensity allow to simulate stressful sit-\nuations in a real word tasks. The effects of the project on the required\ncompetencies are measured using the KYSS method.\n1\narXiv:2502.21114v1  [cs.CY]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\nThe results prove that the presented method increased participants\nsoft skills in communication, cooperation, digital skills and self reflection.\nkeywords:\nsoft-skills, future-skills, intensive, multidisciplinary, in-\nternational, intercultural, active-learing\n1\nIntroduction\nSoft and future skills are vital for graduates [35, 17].\nHowever, many\nstudents underestimate their importance and believe that domain com-\npetencies are sufficient [45]. Students who recognize the importance of\nsoft skills achieve higher salaries, while graduates with lower wages focus\nprimarily on hard skills [29].\nAdditionally, the authors of [21] predict\nthat after COVID-19, the changes in working conditions will further in-\ncrease the demand for soft skills of employees. Higher education institu-\ntions (HEIs) need not only to provide students with appropriate domain\ncompetencies, but also help them develop inter-domain and interpersonal\nskills. Therefore, HEIs have to modify teaching methodologies accord-\ningly. Many approaches have been proposed to address the mentioned\ndemands. Most of them are based on active learning, problem-solving,\nand group-work methods [49, 11, 18, 53].\nActive learning and problem-based methods are easily applicable in\nan educational institution, but these methods alone are not enough to in-\ncrease cooperation and communication skills like empathy. Moreover, in\nreal-life working environment, the IT specialists often have to cooperate\nwith non-technical persons [20]. Unfortunately, incorporation of multidis-\nciplinary and intercultural aspects into teaching in class environments is\nnot straightforward. In this paper we present an approach to teaching soft\nand future skills in an international cooperation project between HEIs and\nanalyse its effect on students’ self-assessed competencies with regards to\ncommunication, cooperation, flexibility, digital skills, creativity, critical\nthinking, willingness to learn and self-reflection. In the project, during a\n10-day intensive course, students worked in interdisciplinary teams with\nother students from different (academic) cultures, different languages and\ndifferent backgrounds. The result on increased soft and future skills in\nparticipating students is measured using the KYSS questionnaire [10, 15].\nThe development of KYSS (see Section 4) was focused on correspondence\nbetween survey questions, language and its understanding by participants\nas well as on measurement of soft and social skills.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In the Section 2 we discuss the\nproblem of soft- and future-skills in modern education. Next section is\ndedicated to description of the project. Later we introduce KYSS sur-\nvey. Sections 5 and 6 focus on results and interpretation of KYSS surveys\nconducted during the project. At the end of the paper we present Con-\nclusions.\n2\n\n\n2\nRelated Works\n2.1\nSoft and future skills\nThe importance of soft skills has long been established [28, 40]. While hard\nskills usually refer to domain specific competencies, such as databases, pro-\ngramming or operating systems, soft skills are complementary skills that\nare important for professional success and operating in a team in working\nenvironment [40, 12]. While there is no consensual definition of soft skills\nnor a finite list of single skills, soft skills usually include skills related to\ninterpersonal skills (communication, collaboration, empathy), reflection\n(critical thinking, problem solving) and self-development (learning, self-\nreflection) [40, 12]. Soft skills are hard to measure, they are best learned\nwhen they are integrated with hard skills [12].\nThe concept of future\nskills or 21st century skills extends the concept of soft skills towards skills\nthat help to cope with an ever changing professional environment. Future\nskills overlap with soft skills, but prioritize information management, crit-\nical thinking, creativity, problem solving, collaboration, communication,\nself-direction, lifelong learning, ethical awareness, cultural awareness and\nflexibility [51, 2]. Like soft skills, future skills are difficult to measure,\ntoo [2]. As additional requirement for future workforce is entrepreneurial\nreadiness. Entrepreneurship and its connection with computational think-\ning is important a much computer science as well as in social study disci-\nplines [27].\nThe soft skills most frequently addressed in curricula are communica-\ntion, teamwork, ethics and presentation skills [22]. However, skills such as\ncreativity and empathy are lacking in the curricula, even though they are\nrequired by industry [22]. Important future skills such as critical think-\ning and self-reflection were only found in 16% and 13% of the analysed\ncurricula respectively [22].\nProbably the most frequently cited soft skill is the ability to commu-\nnicate. This includes the ability to communicate in English as the lingua\nfranca (including the ability to communicate with non-native speakers), to\ncommunicate across disciplines, hierarchies, cultures and genders, in writ-\nten and oral form, and to listen and to visualize [38, 5]. Communications\nskills are often taught using presentations, peer review, role play or team\ntasks [38]. Communication skills are especially important in situations\nsuch as teamwork, negotiations, job interviews and mentoring [23].\nThe ability to jointly solve a task with others is referred to as coop-\neration skills. Problem based learning [37, 48] and portfolio projects [6]\nhave been documented to improve cooperation skills.\nFlexibility is the ability to adapt to changing circumstances.\nIt is\nespecially relevant for project management, for example in software de-\nvelopment [46].\nFlexibility includes the ability to change, to learn, to\naccept and to adjust [39, 5].\nDigital skills refer to the proficient but ciritical use of digital infor-\nmation, media and tools [43] as well as the attitude towards those [51].\nCreativity is the ability to generate new ideas or recombine existing ideas\ninto new concepts [25]. Learning creativity is associated with risk taking,\ndiversity of inputs, generation of ideas and evaluating/prioritizing them\n3\n\n\nlater [25].\nCritical thinking as a skill has been studied extensively since the 1990s\n[7]. Critical thinking is related to problem solving and requires domain\nknowledge and skills as a base for intellectual and cognitive analysis, inter-\npretation, argumentation and judgement [7, 1]. Critical thinking appears\nto be more difficult to teach and requires longer interventions in compari-\nson with other skills [7]. Because of the link to domain knowledge, critical\nthinking skills improve with time spent studying and books read [47].\nWillingness to learn is the skill that includes the notions of being\nresponsible for one’s own learning, self-management of learning and self-\nexpertise of learning [44]. Willingness to learn requires alertness, open-\nness and reflection, as learning does not always take place automatically,\nthrough experience [50].\nSelf-reflection involves the purposeful mental processing of one’s own\nlearning process and outcomes.\nIt is a pre-requisite for problem-based\nlearning [30].\nSelf-reflection is especially important when learners face\nanxiety in complex tasks in team projects [42].\nSelf-reflection is often\ntaught through reflective journal writing [8, 30].\nIn education, soft skills can be taught using didactic settings that\nrequire teamwork, reflection and diversity [24].\n2.2\nActive and problem based learning\nActive learning and problem based methods are commonly used in ed-\nucation, especially in education.\nMany classes end with real-life small\nprojects and probably all higher education institutions use project based\nclasses in their curricula. In ACM and IEEE Join Task Force documents\nwe can find explicit suggestions to enforce the growth of problem based\nand active learning methods at least with use of teamwork and group\nprojects in study programs [26, 19]. In many papers, we can see how peo-\nple use these approaches in teachings (see implementation review papers\n[49, 11, 18, 3] ). Problem based learning was also successfully applied in\ninternational contexts before [4].\nIt is, however, challenging to design collaborative learning settings\nbased on learning objectives, learner characteristics and contextual factors\nand to align the assessment [41].\nMost of the implementations are in-\nclass solutions. Therefore, they use homogeneous students, the students\nrepresent the same domain or institution. We are interested in approaches\nthat incorporate multidisciplinary and intercultural groups with active\nand problem based learning. In the literature not many methods fulfill\nthese requirements [34].\nIn previous years our group have participated in a few joint projects\n[36, 32, 33] that lead to the development of MIMI methodology [16]. In this\nproject we decided to continue work with this approach as it fits our needs.\nMIMI acronym comes from Multinational, Intercultural, Multidisciplinary\nand Intensive. It is developed especially for short term intensive projects\nfor diverse set of participants. It provide a schedule for such an event, with\ndetailed plan how to organize the work of teams. The organization of the\nevent is suited to enhance selected sills. The connection of activities with\nexpected pedagogical outcomes is sketched in the paper [16]. The method\n4\n\n\nwas recognized and recommended by the authors of [18]. Up to now no\nobjective measurements of the effects were conducted. The measurements\nof effectiveness of small didactic experiments is biased by the size of the\ngroup. On the other hand, the idea of organizing events outside of general\ncurricula leads to small number of participants, as such events can’t be\norganized in bigger scale.\n3\nIntensive project description\nWithin an Erasmus+ cooperation partnership, six European HEIs devel-\noped and implemented an intensive 10-day course to teach soft and future\nskills. The methodology implemented important elements of the MIMI\nmethodology[16] and developed it further. The participating 60 students\nand 10 lecturers met at one of the HEIs and represented different fields\nof study: less than half have computer science background, others were\npursuing degrees in management, tourism, chemistry and production en-\ngineering. Students were assigned to teams of 6 persons with members\nfrom the six participating HEIs and at least three disciplines. The task\nof the groups was to create a prototype of an application or service con-\nnected with the event theme: Digital Entrepreneurship and the Climate.\nAs a result, groups had to prepare a working prototype focused on a real\nlife local needs, create a business potential assessment, and present the\nidea to internal and external audience. The organizers assigned one staff\nmember for each group to be their mentor. The role of the mentor was to\nsupport the team and take the role of an advisor. The teams should be\nself-driven, and all the decisions were to be made by the student members.\nThe intensive course was split into three stages; each stage ended with a\ngroup presentation. The first two days are devoted to team building and\nbrainstorming. On the second day, the teams presented ideas as a pitch\nspeech. The second part was dedicated to the development of the idea.\nThe teams worked on prototypes and development of the application’s\ncontent and on business elements, such as stakeholders, user personas,\ncost assessments, Business Model Canvas, and SWOT analysis. On the\nfifth day of the event the groups presented their proposition again. During\nthe last stage, the teams polished their business ideas and prototypes. On\nthe ninth day of the project, more formal presentations took place with\ninvited external partners who also provided independent feedback to the\nteams. In all presentations during the project, every member of the team\nhad to take an active role. Soft and future skills were self-assessed by\nstudents using the KYSS questionnaire [10].\nStudents filled out the questionnaire on the first and the last day of the\nintensive course. An important difference to the MIMI methodology [16]\nwas that we did not conduct lectures and workshops during the intensive\ncourse. However, short motivating, interactive sessions, similar to TED\ntalks aligned the students’ knowledge on project goals, teamwork, software\nand service design as well as business potential assessment. These talks\nallowed participating students to get acquainted with staff members who\ncould help them later with specific problems in the course of the project.\nThe course was not set up as a contest, there was no winning team.\n5\n\n\nIt was explicitly suggested that teams help each other if possible.\nAt\nthe beginning of each day, the assigned mentor met with the team to\nconduct an assessment of tasks done, plan for the day and next days, and\ndiscuss the idea developed by the team. Often, mentors met with their\nteams several times per day. The frequency and length of the meetings\ndepended on the stage of the project and the needs of the team. In the\nfirst days, the mentor helped moderate brainstorming or improve focus on\nidea development. Later the mentor coached the team to finish the tasks\nthat allow the team to achieve its goals.\n4\nKYSS survey\nThe design and assessment of didactic methodologies requires qualitative\nand quantitative evaluation of the results [31]. In our project we need a\nmeasurement tool that can help to measure the impact on participant’s\nsoft and future skills. The measurement of soft and future skills is not\neasy and obvious. The KYSS survey [10] fits our needs. Therefore we\nhave decided to use this approach. The method allows to measure the\nlevel of soft and future skills in selected categories.\nKYSS comes from Kickstart Your Soft Skills and was developed within\nthe European Social Fund project under that name. The approach divides\nsoft skills into four domains: interaction, problem-solving, information\nprocessing, and personal. For each domain some categories, like commu-\nnication, cooperation, critical thinking, etc., were defined. The creators\nof KYSS survey developed a self-report questionnaire to estimate soft and\nfuture skills. It can be used as self-assessment tools for everyone. The\nquestionnaire results in a score that is recorded and described in an in-\ndividual feedback report. In addition to the scores, this feedback report\nalso contains score-based feedback for each of the recorded skills. In the\nprocess they used standardization and validation procedures to estimate\nimportance of the answers and correspondence to measured skills [10, 15].\nThe KYSS survey was prepared in dutch. At first the creators developed\na vocabulary that correspond with selected soft skills. On that base they\ncreated a set of questions, and measured if a survey participant understand\nthe question in a proper way. The work with local government institutions\nfor unemployed people as well as VDAB one of the biggest recruitment\ncompany in Belgium allowed to build adequate and verified questionnaire.\nAll questions are connected to selected soft-skills and the correlation was\nassessed in real-life environment. In our case we use translation of original\ndutch questions into English.\nKYSS allows respondents to self-assess those skill categories using a\nsurvey questionnaire. In this project, we have decided to measure seven\nselected categories: communication, cooperation, digital skills, creativity,\ncritical thinking, willingness to learn, and self-reflection.\nThe KYSS survey can be performed as an online survey. We asked\nall students to do the survey twice, at the beginning and at the end of\nthe 10-day intensive course. We applied statistical tests to to the data\nto determine if there was a significant statistical difference between pre-\nand post-tests. The difference would suggest that there is an effect on\n6\n\n\nparticipants’ skills. Moreover, we were interested to see if the post-test\nresults were better than the pre-test ones. Therefore, we used a one-side\nstatistical test in order to evaluate if improvement in selected skills can\nbe observed.\n5\nAssessment of project effects\nDuring the project, we assessed the project’s effects in two ways.\nWe\nasked the participants to fill out a simple questionnaire to map students’\nreception of the project.\nAdditionally, we used the KYSS method to\nmeasure the impact on students’ soft and future skills.\nIn the basic questionnaire, the participants generally expressed posi-\ntive reactions to the event (Tab. 1).\nQuestion\nYes [%]\nDo you feel that this project improved your com-\nmunication skills?\n96%\nDo you feel that this project improved your crit-\nical thinking?\n89%\nDo you feel that this project improved your cre-\nativity?\n83%\nDo you feel that the project improved your en-\ntrepreneurial skills?\n76%\nDo you feel this project promotes excellence in\nlearning, teaching and skills development?\n81%\nDo you feel that this project promotes interna-\ntionalization?\n96%\nTable 1: Students answers to basic questionnaire\nAs we can see, the students evaluated the learning experience and\nlearning gains very positively. The KYSS survey provides a deeper and\nmore reliable understanding of the project’s effects on participants’ soft\nskills.\nDuring the event, we measured students’ soft and future skills with\nthe use of KYSS surveys. One survey was filled out on the first day of the\nproject, the other on the last one. Both answers were connected, and we\nwere able to pair up the pre- and post-event answers. Students answered\nthe questions on a five-level Likert scale: ’Strongly agree’, ’Agree’, ’Neither\nagree nor disagree’, ’Disagree’, ’Strongly disagree’. We assign a value of\n2,1,0,-1, and -2 for each answer. This allows us to apply statistical tests\nand measure hypothesis if the project improves students’ skills.\nWe could have analyzed the effect on the basis of individual questions,\nbut we decided to work on categories, as the questions individually are less\ninformative than when combined together. In order to assess the effect on\na given category, we have summed up all the answers of a given student.\nWe can say that the students obtained some points for answers in each of\nthe categories for pre-and post-tests. For each category, we have the Null\n7\n\n\nHypothesis H0 that both sets of results for a given category have the same\nstatistics. Additionally, we believe that the results of post-event surveys\nare better than in pre-test. We test the hypothesis H1 that the results\nfor a given category of post-event tests are statistically better than those\nfrom pre-event tests. In all categories the results of post-tests have higher\nmean and median than in pre-test, but it is not enough to validate the\nincrease of skills. Therefore, we use statistical test to verify our hypothesis.\nOne-sided rank statistical tests are much more appropriate for hypothesis\ntesting in similar scientific problems [9, 13]. In this research, we use the\nWilcoxon one-side test [54, 14], implemented in python scipy library [52].\nFor all tests, we used significance level α equal to 0.05, which means if the\np-value obtained for a given statistical test is lower than the significance\nlevel, we can reject the null hypothesis in favor of hypothesis H1. On the\nother hand, if the p-value is higher than the significance level, we have no\nreason to reject the null hypothesis H0\nWe present results for all categories independently.\n5.1\nCategory: communication\nThis category contains eight questions. All answers for a student were\nsummed up and paired. The results of pre-and post-survey results and\nthe difference post-result minus pre-result are presented in Fig. 5.1. Pa-\nrameters of distribution of the results are in Table 2.\nParameter\npre\npost\nmean\n6.368\n7.763\nmedian\n7.000\n8.000\nσ (st. deviation)\n4.737\n4.386\nWilcoxon test results\np-value\n0.020\nTable 2: Results for the category: communication.\nUsing the Wilcoxon one-side test, we obtained a p-value equal to 0.020.\nAs this is lower than 0.05, we can reject H0 hypothesis. Therefore we\naccept the H1 hypothesis that the results of the post-event test are sta-\ntistically better than those obtained by a student in the pre-event test.\n5.2\nCategory: cooperation\nThe category cooperation contains six questions; we have proceeded in\nthe same way as in the previous category (see Fig. 5.2 and Tab. 3).\nThe Wilcoxon test returned a p-value equal to 0.012, and as before,\nwe can accept the H1 hypothesis for this category.\n5.3\nCategory: flexibility\nThe category flexibility contains six questions (results in Fig. 5.3, Tab. 4).\n8\n\n\nFigure 1: Results for category communication.\n.\nParameter\npre\npost\nmean\n5.447\n6.579\nmedian\n5.500\n6.000\nσ (st. deviation)\n3.118\n2.769\nWilcoxon test results\np-value\n0.012\nTable 3: Results for the category: cooperation.\nThe Wilcoxon test returned a p-value equal to 0.117, so we can’t accept\nthe H1 hypothesis for this category. The conclusion is that the distribution\nof pre and post-results are statistically similar and can represent the same\nbackground statistics.\n5.4\nCategory: digital skills\nThe category digital skills contains four questions (results in Fig. 5.4 and\nTab. 5). The Wilcoxon test returned a p-value equal to 0.013, and we can\naccept the H1 hypothesis for this category.\n9\n\n\nFigure 2: Results for category: cooperation.\nParameter\npre\npost\nmean\n4.763\n5.211\nmedian\n5.000\n6.000\nσ (st. deviation)\n3.638\n3.197\nWilcoxon test results\np-value\n0.117\nTable 4: Results for the category: flexibility.\nParameter\npre\npost\nmean\n2.605\n3.395\nmedian\n3.000\n4.000\nσ (st. deviation)\n2.651\n2.700\nWilcoxon test results\np-value\n0.013\nTable 5: Results for the category: digital skills.\n10\n\n\nFigure 3: Results for categories: flexibility.\n5.5\nCategory: creativity\nThe category creativity contains six questions; we have proceeded the\nsame way as in previous categories (see Fig. 5.5, Tab. 6).\nParameter\npre\npost\nmean\n4.974\n5.447\nmedian\n5.000\n5.500\nσ (st. deviation)\n2.748\n2.468\nWilcoxon test results\np-value\n0.095\nTable 6: Results for the category: creativity.\nThe Wilcoxon test returned a p-value equal to 0.095, so we cannot\naccept the H1 hypothesis for this category.\n5.6\nCategory: critical thinking\nThe category critical thinking contains five questions; we have proceeded\nin the same way as in previous categories (see Fig. 5.6 and Tab. 7).\n11\n\n\nFigure 4: Results for categories: flexibility and digital skills.\nParameter\npre\npost\nmean\n4.526\n5.263\nmedian\n5.000\n5.000\nσ (st. deviation)\n2.613\n2.244\nWilcoxon test results\np-value\n0.058\nTable 7: Results for the category: critical thinking.\nThe Wilcoxon test returned a p-value equal to 0.058, so we cannot\naccept the H1 hypothesis for this category.

The conclusion is that the\ndistribution of pre and post-results are statistically similar.\n12\n\n\nFigure 5: Results for categories: creativity.\nParameter\npre\npost\nmean\n5.632\n6.237\nmedian\n5.000\n6.000\nσ (st. deviation)\n2.630\n2.538\nWilcoxon test results\np-value\n0.073\nTable 8: Results for the category: willingness to learn.\n5.8\nCategory: self reflection\nThe category self reflection contains five questions (see Fig. 5.8, Tab. 9).\nThe Wilcoxon test returned a p-value equal to 0.003, and so we can\naccept the H1 hypothesis for this category.\n6\nDiscussion\nThe results obtained for each category are presented in Table 10. We can\ndeduce that for four categories: communication, cooperation, digital skills,\nand self-reflection, the test results prove the increase of appropriate skills\n13\n\n\nFigure 6: Results for categories: creativity and critical thinking.\nParameter\npre\npost\nmean\n3.974\n4.895\nmedian\n4.000\n5.000\nσ (st. deviation)\n2.253\n2.186\nWilcoxon test results\np-value\n0.003\nTable 9: Results for the category: self reflection.\nduring the event. There is no reason to deduce similar implications for\nother categories like willingness to learn, critical thinking, flexibility, and\ncreativity. In truth, the results are not very surprising. The event is only\nten days long, and not all measured skills can be influenced in the same\nway during such a short time. The skills connected with communication,\ncooperation, and digital skills can be trained in a relatively short time. We\nthink that self-reflection has increased as the participants discovered that\nthey can obtain good results in a real-life task. The students learned that\nthey can work and achieve required goals in a high-stress situation with\nemphasis on results. On the other hand, skills like creativity, flexibility,\ncritical thinking, and willingness to learn can’t be increased in short forms\n14\n\n\nFigure 7: Results for categories: willingness to learn.\nand require a longer process. It is worth to mention, that the applied tests\ndo not decide if the H1 hypothesis is improbable to be true. It shows that\nthere is no reason to reject H0. Additionally, all results are statistical, so\nin particular students the effects could be different.\nIt is worth mentioning that there are differences between KYSS results\nand results obtained from direct questions from participants (see Tables 1\nand 10). For example, about 89% of participants believe that their critical\nthinking was improved, but analysis of KYSS surveys did not prove that\nassessment. It could mean that the overall positive emotions to the event\nincrease the percentage of positive answers. Additionally, the students are\nnot always able to properly assess their skills.\n7\nConclusions\nThe method used in the project was expected to have a positive impact\non the participants. Moreover, the event we describe is the second event\nof this type organized together.\nStaff members who have worked with\nstudents on the previous event observed positive impact on students’ soft\nand future skills. The observations in the following academic year, suggest\nhigher increase in skills in the project participants when compared with\n15\n\n\nFigure 8: Results for categories: flexibility and digital skills.\nthe other students on the degree programme. This time during the event,\nwe have incorporated KYSS surveys as a measurement tool. The results\nsupport the expectations and previous observations. Not all aspects mea-\nsured with KYSS show similar growth. The different effects of the project\non different skill categories were expected. Moreover, the KYSS gives a\nmore reliable assessment of the project’s effects than simple direct ques-\ntionnaire. Based on the presented results, the consortium will conduct a\nsimilar effect and measure its impacts on the participants.\nThe effects, show that Software Develompment projects can be used\nfor multidisciplinary education. This type of team task allows to increase\ncommunication and cooperation in diverse group. Young people are eager\nto use and create new solutions that use modern technologies.

This study focuses on the development of specialized\ntraining datasets to enhance the encoding of mathematical content. We introduce Math\nMutator (MAMUT), a framework capable of generating equivalent and falsified versions\nof a given mathematical formula in LATEX notation, effectively capturing the mathematical\nvariety in notation of the same concept. Based on MAMUT, we have generated four large\nmathematical datasets containing diverse notation, which can be used to train language\nmodels with enhanced mathematical embeddings.\n1\nIntroduction\nMathematical formulas are a fundamental and widely used component in various scientific fields, serving as\na universal language for expressing complex concepts and relationships. Their context-dependent symbols,\nnested operations, and diverse notations pose distinct challenges for machine learning models due to their\nsymbolic and structural differences from natural language (Zanibbi et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021).\nDespite the success of transformer-based language models (Vaswani et al., 2017) in natural language tasks,\nthey encounter challenges in comprehending mathematical notation (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Gong et al.,\n2022; Petersen et al., 2023; Dao & Le, 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Reusch et al., 2024; Qiao et al., 2024).\nRaw Datasets\n\\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\nRaw Datasets\nAMPS, ARQMath (Section 2.2), NMFT (Section 4)\nGeneration of Formula Versions\nEquVG (Section 5.1), FalseVG (Section 5.2)\nGenerated Datasets\ng’(y) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\left(g(h+y) - g(y)\\right)/h\nMF, MT, NMF, MFR (Section 6)\nFigure 1: MAMUT: Modifying formulas to generate large and diverse mathematical datasets.\n1\narXiv:2502.20855v1  [cs.CL]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\nDataset\nDescription\nExample(s)\nMathematical\nFormulas (MF)\nMathematical formulas with\nhigh variance\nx · xN = x1+N\n(a −b)/(b ∗a) = −1/a + 1\nb\nMathematical\nTexts (MT)\nTexts combining natural lan-\nguage and mathematical for-\nmulas\nIdentify P∞\nn=0(yn −L) where yn+1 = (1+yn)\n1\n3 and\nL3 = L + 1.

The examples are shown as rendered LATEX.\nThese challenges stem from the complex formula structure, diverse formula representations, and ambiguous\nimplicit semantics (Peng et al., 2021).\nFor example, x =\n−b±\n√\nb2−4ac\n2a\ninvolves nested operations, while\ndifferent notations, such as x\ny , x/y, x ÷ y, and x · y−1 can represent the same mathematical relationship,\nalongside the contextual meanings of symbols (e.g., i as an index or imaginary unit) further complicate\nthe understanding. These difficulties highlight the need for rich, specialized datasets to train models for\nmathematical content. However, existing datasets face scalability constraints due to expert curation or lack\ndiversity in problem types and notation.\nTo address the need, we propose a framework, Math Mutator (MAMUT), for generating high-quality and\ndiverse mathematical formulas to enhance the training and comprehension capabilities of mathematical\nlanguage models. MAMUT allows for the creation of mathematically equivalent formulas (EquVG) and\nchallenging non-equivalent ones that appear similar (FalseVG). This includes random alterations in variable\nand function identifiers and variations in LATEX notation that leverage mathematical properties such as\ncommutativity and symmetry. Additionally, we extend this approach to text containing mathematical LATEX\nnotation, ensuring consistent changes in identifiers and notation styles across textual contexts. We apply\nMAMUT to generate four datasets (see Figure 1 and Table 1) designed for the training of mathematical\nlanguage models, e.g., for further mathematical pre-training on equation completion tasks.\n2\nRelated Work\nThis section covers language models, datasets, and data augmentation techniques in mathematical contexts.\n2.1\nMathematical Language Models\nThe success of transformer-based models (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), led\nto the development of domain-specific models, including SciBERT for scientific texts (Beltagy et al., 2019)\nand CodeBERT for programming (Feng et al., 2020). These models improve over general-purpose models\nby training on domain-specific data. Similarly, specialized models have been developed for mathematics,\nsuch as MathBERT (Peng et al., 2021), MathBERTa (Novotný & Štefánik, 2022), and others (Reusch et al.,\n2022; Liu et al., 2023; Shao et al., 2024). They typically employ additional mathematical tokens and were\npre-trained on mathematical datasets (see Section 2.2).\nA key application of mathematical language models is in Mathematical Information Retrieval (MIR) (Dadure\net al., 2024; Zanibbi et al., 2025), where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents based on a user’s query,\n2\n\n\nQuery\nRelevant Documents\nNot Relevant Documents\n(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2\na2 + 2ab + b2 = (a + b)2\n(a + b)2 + a2 = 2ab + b2\n(c + d)2 = c2 + 2cd + d2\n(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + a2\n(a + b)2 = a2 + b2 + 2ab\n(a + b)2 = a2 + b2\na2 + b2 = c2\nc2 = a2 + b2\na2 + b2 + c2\nPythagorean Theorem\na2 + b2 = c2\nPythagorean Identity\nP∞\nn=1\n1\nn\nP∞\nk=1 k−1\nP∞\nn=1\n1\nn2\nf ′(x) = limh→0\nf(x+h)−f(x)\nh\nd\ndzg(z) = limd→0\ng(z+d)−g(z)\nd\nlimx→0 f(x) = 0\nTable 2: Examples for MIR queries including relevant and not relevant documents. Note that Pythagorean\nIdentity (sin2(x) + cos2(x) = 1) is not relevant for the query Pythagorean Theorem (a2 + b2 = c2).\nwhere both may contain mathematical content (see Table 2 for examples). Traditional MIR systems rely\non keyword matching or simple embeddings (Kim et al., 2012; Greiner-Petter et al., 2020), while more\nsophisticated techniques leverage explicit mathematical knowledge, such as operator trees or formula unifi-\ncation (Kristianto et al., 2016; Mansouri et al., 2019; 2022b; Aizawa & Kohlhase, 2021; Peng et al., 2021).\nTransformer-based models offer new possibilities for MIR by addressing key challenges such as integrating\nnatural and mathematical language, directly processing LATEX input, and handling diverse notations. As a\nresult, mathematical language models have been successfully adapted to MIR (Novotný & Štefánik, 2022;\nReusch et al., 2022; Zhong et al., 2023).\nDespite their promising performance, specialized mathematical models still face challenges in understanding\nmathematical notation (Gong et al., 2022; Shen et al., 2023), especially when it comes to handling variable\nnames and recognizing mathematical equivalence beyond superficial textual similarities (Reusch et al., 2024).\nThis motivates the creation of specialized datasets that reflect the unique roles of variables and aim to improve\nmathematical modeling.\n2.2\nMathematical Datasets\nThe need for mathematical models has led to the development of various collections aimed at enhancing and\nevaluating language model capabilities in context of mathematics. Manually curated datasets like MATH\n(Hendrycks et al., 2021), GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), and MathOdyssey (Fang et al., 2024) test problem-\nsolving skills but are typically small, and reliant on expert input. Synthetically generated datasets like the\nMathematics Dataset (Saxton et al., 2019), AMPS (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and HARDMath (Fan et al.,\n2024) offer scalability but may lack diversity in problem topics, as they rely on generation rules, although\nthey can produce a wide variety of similar but distinct problems (with changing numbers, symbols, . . . ),\nwhich can be beneficial for models learning to generalize across formula representations.\nDatasets like\nNTCIR (Zanibbi et al., 2016) and ARQMath (Mansouri et al., 2022a), sourced from the existing repositories\narXiv, Wikipedia, and the Mathematical Stack Exchange, provide a broad range of real-world mathematical\nproblems. However, they lack controlled variations of specific formulas, an important aspect for training\nMIR models to classify whether two symbolic representations are mathematically equivalent.\n2.3\nMathematical Data Augmentation Techniques\nRecent advancements in mathematical data augmentation have introduced various innovative methods aimed\nat enhancing the diversity and depth of training materials. InfinityMath (Zhang et al., 2024) utilize GPT-4\n(Achiam et al., 2023) to transform specific mathematical problems into generic templates. These templates\ncan then generate multiple variations of the original problem, altering numerical values or structural com-\nplexity, thereby increasing the dataset’s variety. Similarly, Li et al. (2024) propose a method to formalize\n3\n\n\nNatural Language\nMathematical Language\nPurpose\nGeneral human communication, includ-\ning opinions and feelings\nPrecise description of mathematical concepts\nVocabulary Large set of words (language depen-\ndent), sometimes with ambiguous mean-\ning (e.g., love, happy, data)\nSmall set of well-defined symbols (e.g., x, +,\nR, sin, ∀, ∞,\nR\n) and terms (e.g., Eigenvalue,\nDerivative, Field) with precise meanings\nGrammar\nRather flexible\nStrict rules\nClarity\nOften imprecise, open to interpretation\nSingle, unambiguous interpretation\nEvolution\nEvolves over time naturally, new words,\nphrases, and idioms emerge or disappear\nEvolves slower,\nchanges are introduced by\nmathematicians and are backward compatible\nWriting\nStyle\nLinear structure in sentences and para-\ngraphs using standard formats\nRequires specialized formats (e.g., LATEX) to\nrepresent complex notation in a structured way\nTable 3: Comparison of natural and mathematical language.\nmathematical problems written in natural language, alter the difficulty by adjusting the problem’s opera-\ntions, and then informalize these changes back into natural language using GPT-4, preserving mathematical\nintegrity across different levels of complexity. MathGenie (Lu et al., 2024) augments step-by-step solutions\nby generating modified candidate solutions with a Llama model (Touvron et al., 2023) with verified correct-\nness, and then back-propagating these solutions to a modified question. You et al. (2024) augment data by\napplying different strategies, including rephrasing and reorganization with LLM, and question alteration.\nThese approaches primarily focus on diversifying problem content rather than varying mathematical notation\n(e.g., (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2 vs. (x + y)2 = x2 + y2 + 2yx). In contrast, Reusch et al. (2024) explore\nvariable renaming in training data to prevent models from taking shortcuts in problem-solving, such as\nrelying only on variable overlap. Building on this idea, our study enhances mathematical formula diversity\nthrough substitutions and other techniques.\n3\nNatural and Mathematical Language\nMathematical language differs fundamentally from natural languages such as English, German, or Chi-\nnese. While natural language is used for general communication and often conveys subjective information,\nmathematical language serves a highly specialized purpose to precisely describe mathematical topics, such as\ndefinitions, theorems, and proofs. It consists of both symbolic expressions (e.g., a2+b2 = c2 and\nR b\na sin(x), dx)\nand specialized terminology (e.g., derivative and eigenvalue). Despite their differences, natural and mathe-\nmatical languages share some structural similarities. Both use symbols arranged in a syntax that conveys\nmeaning, and both can be represented in textual form. However, there are some key differences (Ilany et al.,\n2010; Scarlatos & Lan, 2023) summarized in Table 3. A crucial challenge for mathematical language models\nis symbol abstraction. In mathematical expressions, certain symbols act essentially as wildcards and can be\nreplaced without changing the mathematical meaning. These symbols are either variables (e.g., x, α, A) or\ngeneric functions (e.g., f, g or φ), i.e., functions not tied to a specific mathematical object (e.g., Euler’s\nGamma function Γ(z)). For example, a model should recognize that the first binomial formula,\n(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2,\n(1)\nis equivalent to (c+d)2 = c2 +2cd+d2, despite different variable names. In contrast, (a+b)2 = a2 +2ab+a2\nuses the same variables but in a mathematically non-derivable way. Likewise, the modified formula (a+b)2 =\na2 + b2 + 2ab appears different from Eq. (1), but it is, in fact, mathematically equivalent.\nAnother important aspect is the structure of mathematical formulas. Consider the two formulas 2x and x2.\nAssuming a character-wise LATEX tokenization, both formulas use the same tokens but in a different order.\nA model should not treat x2 as equivalent to 2x (but instead to x · x).

Transformer language models (Vaswani et al., 2017) have shown their capabilities in modeling\nnatural language, hence, it is worth exploring their potential to precisely capture mathematical language.\n4\nNamed Mathematical Formula Templates (NMFT)\nPrevious datasets provide formulas and mathematical texts with significant variance across a wide range of\nmathematical topics. For the purpose of our proposed data augmentation methods introduced in the next\nsection, it is necessary to parse formulas into symbolic expressions. Real-world datasets contain formulas with\nvarious notations, some of them might be parsed incorrectly, or the parsing even fails completely. Therefore,\nwe created a dataset consisting of only a few but high-quality parsable formulas. This dataset includes 71\nwell-known mathematical identities that are easily recognizable and associated with one or multiple names.\nFor example, a2 + b2 = c2 represents the Pythagorean theorem, while (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2 represents\nthe first binomial formula (Eq. 1). Since mathematical formulas are associated with its name, we call this\ndataset Named Mathematical Formula Templates (NMFT), as the formulas serve as templates for deriving\nmodified versions. An example entry can be found in Table 4, and Table 6 lists all identities.\nEach identity provides multiple representations, such as ∀a, b ∈R : (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2 as another, more\ndetailed version of the first binomial formula. Additionally, some representations are provided as descriptive\ntext, e.g., “In a right-angled triangle with side lengths a, b, and c, where c represents the length of the\nhypotenuse, the equation a2 + b2 = c2 holds true”. Others paraphrase formulas textually, e.g., “a2 + b2\nis equal to c2”, reinforcing associations between the equals sign = and “equals”. These textual versions\nintentionally exclude the name of the identity to make MIR tasks harder, where the name serves as the\nquery. For each provided identity version, the variables and function symbols are explicitly given to assist\nthe parsing and version generation. To enhance the generation of challenging falsified versions, similar-looking\nformulas are provided (e.g., the first binomial formula for the Pythagorean theorem, as both identities contain\nmultiple powers of two), or hints to falsify any given representation by a string replacement (e.g., removing\n“right-angled” to falsify the previous descriptive example of the Pythagorean theorem). The descriptive\ntext versions have been partially generated by using GPT-3.5 (Brown et al., 2020) and manually verified\nfor validity. Typically, we call entries of NMFT and of datasets generated from it formulas, but both, pure\nmathematical formulas and textual descriptions of formulas are meant.\n5\n\n\n5\nMath Mutator (MAMUT)\nOur goal is to create high-quality, large, and diverse mathematical datasets to enhance mathematical mod-\neling. We introduce Math Mutator (MAMUT), a framework consisting of two core algorithms designed to\ngenerate both equivalent and falsified versions of a given formula. The first algorithm, Equivalent Version\nGeneration (EquVG), presented in Section 5.1, automatically generates various versions of a given formula,\nexpanding the training data and enabling the model to learn math-specific language rules, such as treating\nvariables as placeholders that can be substituted without changing the validity of an expression. The sec-\nond algorithm, Falsified Version Generation (FalseVG), introduced in Section 5.2, slightly modifies formulas\nslightly to create mathematically not equivalent versions of the original formula, offering challenging negative\nexamples for MIR tasks.\n5.1\nEquVG: Variations of Mathematical Formulas\nThe key idea of this section can be summarized as follows: Given a mathematical formula, our aim is\nto generate mathematically equivalent variations of this formula, called equivalent versions. For instance,\nconsider the formula\n(a + b)2 = a2 + 2 · a · b + b2.\n(2)\nIn this context, we observe that all the following formulas describe the same mathematical relationship,\nnamely the first binomial formula:\n(b + a)2 = a2 + b2 + 2 · b · a,\n(3)\n(a + b)2 = a · a + 2 · a · b + b2,\n(4)\na2 + 2 · a · b + b2 = (a + b)2,\n(5)\n(c + d)2 = c2 + 2 · c · d + d2,\n(6)\n(λ + Z)2 = λ2 + 2 · λ · Z + Z2.\n(7)\nEquation (3) can be derived from Eq. (2) by applying both, additive and multiplicative commutativity. In\nEq. (4), the exponentiation a2 is replaced by its definition a · a. Since equality is a symmetric relation,\nequations remain valid after interchanging the sides, as done in Eq. (5). The final two equations can be\nobtained from Eq. (2) by substituting variables. This section is dedicated to the automated generation of\nsuch equivalent versions. Note that for a complete mathematical expression, it would be necessary to specify\nthe range of values (e.g., of variables) for which the statement holds. For example, a complete expression\nof Eq. (2) could be ∀a, b ∈R : (a + b)2 = a2 + 2 · a · b + b2. However, in practical applications like MIR\nsystems, the shortened version Eq. (2) may also be used, for the sake of simplicity. Therefore, the somewhat\nless precise mathematical formulations in Eqs. (2)-(7) are often sufficient.\nThe complete workflow of our proposed Equivalent Version Generation (EquVG) algorithm is depicted in\nFigure 2. The input consists of a formula written in LATEX format. To implement transformations, as seen in\nEqs. (2)-(7), we can identify two steps: the substitution of symbols and the modification of the mathematical\nnotation. For both of these purposes, it is helpful to represent the formula not as a string but as a structured\ndata format that captures the mathematical relationships and dependencies. This representation is achieved\nby parsing the LATEX formulas into a symbolic expression format, essentially creating an operator tree. The\nsymbolic representation categorizes elements into numbers, variables, functions, and other mathematical\nobjects, establishing a structured relationship between them. This organization enables the identification\nand substitution of variables (x, \\alpha, . . . ) and generic functions (f, g, . . . ) to derive a mathematically\nequivalent representation using different symbols. This substituted expression is then converted back into\nLATEX format during the printing process, which includes the desired modifications of mathematical notation,\nsuch as writing a · a instead of a2. In the following, we will provide a more detailed explanation of the three\nsteps of EquVG: parsing, substituting, and printing.\nLATEX Parsing\nParsing a LATEX formula into a symbolic expression presents certain challenges.\nFor\ninstance, if a letter precedes parentheses, it can be interpreted either as a multiplication (with omitted\n6\n\n\nInput Formula\nLATEX Parsing\nSymbolic Expression\nSymbol\nSubstitution\nNew Symbolic Expression\nGenerated Formula\nRandomized\nLATEX Printing\n\\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\nEQU(DERIV(FUNC(f, VAR(x))), LIM(DIV(SUB(FUNC(f, ADD(VAR(x),\nVAR(h))), FUNC(f, VAR(x))), VAR(h)), VAR(h), INT(0)))\nVAR(x) →VAR(y), FUNC(f) →FUNC(g)\nEQU(DERIV(FUNC(g, VAR(y))), LIM(DIV(SUB(FUNC(g, ADD(VAR(y),\nVAR(h))), FUNC(g, VAR(y))), VAR(h)), VAR(h), INT(0)))\ng’(y) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\left(g(h+y) - g(y)\\right)/h\nFigure 2: Visualization of the EquVG algorithm.\nInput Formula\nLATEX Parsing\nSymbolic Expression\nSymbol\nSubstitution\nNew Symbolic Expression\nGenerated Formula\nRandomized\nLATEX Printing\nThe derivative of a function $f$, referred to as $\\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$, is defined\nas the limit of $\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$ as $h$ approaches $0$.\nTEXT(\"The derivative of a function “, FUNC(f), “, referred to as “, DERIV(FUNC(f),\nVAR(x)), “, is defined as the limit of “, DIV(SUB(FUNC(f, ADD(VAR(x), VAR(h))),\nFUNC(f, VAR(x))), VAR(h)), “ as “, VAR(h), “ approaches “, INT(0), “.”)\nVAR(x) →VAR(y), FUNC(f) →FUNC(g)\nTEXT(\"The derivative of a function “, FUNC(g), “, referred to as “, DERIV(FUNC(g),\nVAR(y)), “, is defined as the limit of “, DIV(SUB(FUNC(g, ADD(VAR(y), VAR(h))),\nFUNC(g, VAR(y))), VAR(h)), “ as “, VAR(h), “ approaches “, INT(0), “.”)\nThe derivative of a function $g$, referred to as $g’(y)$, is defined\nas the limit of $\\left(g(h+y) - g(y)\\right)/h$ as $h$ approaches $0$.\nFigure 3: Visualization of the EquVG algorithm for a mathematical text.\nmultiplication symbol, e.g., v(x + y) = v · (x + y)) or as a function call (v(x + y)). The symbol e could be\neither a variable or Euler’s number e ≈2.718. Likewise, the symbol i might function as a variable (e.g., as\na summation index in Pn\ni=1 i2) or as the imaginary unit, sometimes expressed in LATEX as i (\\mathrm{i})\nto avoid ambiguity. It is crucial for our purposes to determine whether a symbol is a substitutable variable\nor a constant. Otherwise, the imaginary unit might be incorrectly substituted by another symbol, resulting\nin a non-equivalent expression. We have addressed this issue, partially by applying heuristics that consider\nthe context (i = 1 within the formula indicates a variable, while iπ indicates the imaginary unit, as in eiπ).\nFurthermore, we introduce a safeguard to handle cases where the parser is uncertain about whether to treat a\nsymbol as a variable or the imaginary unit. In these cases, the symbol is represented in a way that prevents\nsubstitution while maintaining its appearance as the plain i, without enabling complex unit formatting\noptions. Despite these measures, parsing can still fail in cases with unusual or malformed notation.\nThe formula parsing can be conceptually expanded to include the parsing of text containing LATEX formulas.\nSuch texts are referred to as mathematical texts in this study. The text parts remain unchanged during\nsubstitution and printing, only the formula parts are processed consistently by EquVG as shown in Figure 3.\nThis allows to consistently change symbols in a mathematical text throughout all its formulas. Within a\nmathematical text, formulas are defined as text in between dollar signs ($...$), as used in LATEX documents\nto write inline mathematical formulas.\nSymbol Substitution\nThe symbolic expression format allows the substitution of symbols by simply\nreplacing all occurrences of a given symbol within the expression. The generation of a substitution (i.e.,\na mapping of symbols) involves two steps. Firstly, a subset of all symbols in the expression is randomly\nselected. Secondly, a new symbol is chosen for each selected symbol. The aim of the substitution process is\n7\n\n\nto generate diverse formulas that are similar to formulas occurring in real-world scenarios. It is important\nto note that, intuitively, Eq. (6) with variables c and d appears more familiar for a binomial formula than\nEq. (7), which uses Greek and uppercase Latin letters (λ and Z) that are not commonly used as variables in\nthe context of binomial formulas. When variables are selected entirely at random from a uniform distribution\nover all Latin and Greek letters, unfamiliar symbol usage is more likely. This motivates the introduction\nof symbol groups, which categorizes similar variables or functions together.\nThe defined symbol groups\ncan be found in Table 10, along with a description of a typical mathematical context for each group. For\ninstance, we have the group of indices {i, j, k, l} and group of vectors {u, v, w}. It is worth noting that\nvariables can belong to multiple groups. Given a symbol that should be substituted with a new symbol,\nall symbols from the relevant symbol group(s) are candidates. Additionally, the most common variable x\nis a candidate in every variable group to reflect its common usage. To add variety, a random symbol may\nbe added by chance to the set of candidates, selected from commonly used lowercase or uppercase Latin\nletters or lowercase Greek letters. Symbols that refer to constants in certain contexts, such as e, i, and\nπ, are excluded.\nGiven the set of candidates, a random candidate is chosen.\nHowever, it is sometimes\nnecessary (or at least useful) to make the symbol selection dependent on multiple substitution symbols. For\ninstance, consider the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\nR b\na f(x) dx = F(b) −F(a). Here, we have two\ngeneric functions, f and F. Whenever a symbol has related variants in the formula, such as uppercase and\nlowercase forms or corresponding Greek letters (e.g., a, A, α), the algorithm automatically preserves these\nrelationships by restricting possible substitutions accordingly. For instance, substituting f and F by g and\nG, respectively, yields an equivalent version\nR b\na g(x) dx = G(b) −G(a). Again, this is rather mathematically\nimprecise but aligns with the implicit assumptions on mathematical notation found in real-world datasets.\nAnother possible generated version is\nR a2\na1 f(x) dx = F(a2)−F(a1) where a and b are substituted by indexed\nvariables a1 and a2 respectively. In cases where multiple variables of the same variable group appear in the\nsame formula, the generation algorithm may randomly perform such indexed substitutions. The indexing\nenforces the model not only to attend to the variable itself but also its modifications, in this case, its index.\nRandomized LATEX Printing\nIn the final step of EquVG, the symbolic expression is converted back\ninto LATEX format. To further increase the variety of generated formulas, the LATEX printer makes ran-\ndomized printing decisions. These variations can be categorized into two main sources: mathematical and\nLATEX notation. The parsed and printed formulas in Figure 3 are illustrating these differences. For example,\nthe input text used the explicit notation for a derivative, \\frac{d}{dx}f(x), while the printed substituted\nexpression uses the shorthand notation g’(y). We developed a list of equivalent mathematical notations,\nwhere the printer randomly selects one of the available ones for printing. As another example in Figure 3,\ninstead of the fraction notation with \\frac, the printer used the forward slash / to denote division. Since\naddition is commutative, h+y is printed instead of y+h. These examples represent mathematical variations,\nas they express a mathematical concept in an equivalent way. In contrast, the usage of \\left and \\right\ncommands represents LATEX variations, since these commands are not essential for mathematical reasons but\nonly for a differently rendered text. In addition to the already covered examples, the randomization of the\nLATEX printer includes the notation of\n• equalities (x = y vs. y = x),\n• inequalities (x > 0 vs. 0 < x),\n• multiplication symbols (a \\cdot b vs. a * b vs. a \\times b vs. ab),\n• divisions (2/n vs. 2 \\cdot n^{-1} vs. \\frac{2}{n} vs. \\frac2n),\n• integer powers (a^3 vs. a^2\\cdot a vs. a \\cdot a \\cdot a),\n• inverse trigonometric functions (\\asin(x) vs. \\arcsin(x) vs. \\sin^{-1}(x) vs. (\\sin(x))^{-1}),\n• higher order derivatives (f’’’(x) vs. f^{(3)}(x) vs. \\frac{d^3}{dx^3} f(x)),\n• expected values (\\mathbb{E}[X] vs. \\operatorname{E}[X] vs. E[X]),\n• matrix determinants (\\det(A) vs. |A|),\n8\n\n\n• binomial coefficients (\\binom{n}{k} vs. {n \\choose k}),\n• empty sets (\\emptyset vs. \\varnothing vs. \\{\\}), and\n• natural logarithms (\\ln(x) vs. \\log_e(x)).\nAs real-world data uses different styles of notations, language models should be capable of understanding all\ncommonly used notations. This is similar to the notion of synonyms in natural language. The randomized\nLATEX printing provides an automation to diversify training data, such that models can learn the different\nnotations. The combination of parsing, substituting, and printing results as part of EquVG is a powerful\ntool to increase the training data size significantly. Additionally, research has shown that using training data\nwith substituted query-document pairs for MIR helps the model to less focus on shallow features such as\nvariable overlapping (Reusch et al., 2024), confirming the usage of substitutions in EquVG.\n5.2\nFalseVG: Generating Challenging Negative Examples\nWe believe that a classification task determining whether two formulas describe the same mathematical\nconcept helps the model to encode mathematics more effectively. To train models on such a task, we require\nboth positive and negative formula pairs, similar to a MIR training. While positive pairs are often readily\navailable in datasets, identifying meaningful negative pairs is more challenging, as datasets rarely contain\nexplicit negative examples.\nA common approach to extract negative pairs is random sampling from datasets by pairing two random\nformulas. However, this may lead to simplified feature extractions. For instance, the model might learn to\nsimply check for the presence of an important function, like whether both formulas contain the determinant\nfunction \\det. Given a random negative document, a naive classifier that checks if a determinant is part of\nthe formula would likely perform well, due to the rarity of the determinant function across most mathematical\ncontexts. The language model may adapt to this behavior during training.\nTo prevent models from learning such easy shortcuts instead of the true semantic understanding, researchers\nhave successfully used challenging negative examples in other domains (Cai & Liu, 2020; Qiu et al., 2021).\nWe introduce the Falsified Version Generation (FalseVG) algorithm to generate falsified versions of a given\nformula, meaning a similar-looking but not mathematically equivalent formula.\nSince the formulas are\nalready parsed into a symbolic expression for EquVG, we can simply use and modify this representation.\nWe have developed and implemented eight modification strategies, which are described below.\nTable 9\nprovides illustrative examples of each strategy. Similar to EquVG, these strategies can also be applied to\nmathematical texts, by applying the strategies to the text’s formulas.\nEquality\nFalsifying an equality can be achieved by inserting or removing a term on one side of the equality.\nThis can be done either at the outermost level (e.g., changing sin(x) = . . . to sin(x) + 1 = . . .) or within a\nsub-expression (e.g., changing sin(x) = . . . to sin(x+1) = . . .). When inserting a term, the algorithm selects\neither a subexpression from the entire formula, a random new variable, or a random number. Importantly,\nthe algorithm avoids modifications that will not change the validity of an equality, such as adding zero\nor multiplying by one.\nThis strategy enforces the model to focus on the entire formula and long-term\ndependencies.\nInequality\nTo falsify an inequality, we simply invert the inequality symbol. Thus, the symbol ≤is replaced\nby > and vice versa. The same replacement holds for ≥and <. The not equals symbol ̸= can be replaced\nby =, but not vice versa (as = indicates an equality). Similarly to the strategy equality, the model is forced\nto encode long-term dependencies using this strategy.\nSwap\nThe strategy swap involves altering unary and binary functions. Unary functions such as sine,\nsquare root, or logarithm get replaced by different random unary functions. In the case of binary non-\ncommutative functions, we swap the order of the two arguments. These non-commutative functions are\nsubtraction, division, and exponentiation (e.g., x2 becomes 2x). These changes enforce the model to rely on\nthe order of operands rather than just token occurrences in a random order.\n9\n\n\nInput Formula\n\\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\nLATEX Parsing\nEQU(DERIV(FUNC(f, VAR(x))), LIM(DIV(SUB(FUNC(f, ADD(VAR(x),\nVAR(h))), FUNC(f, VAR(x))), VAR(h)), VAR(h), INT(0)))\nSymbolic Expression\nStrategy\nSelection\nand\nApplication\nEquality\nInequality\nVariable\nConstant\nSwap\nRemove the dividend VAR(h) of quotient DIV\nNo change\nReplace VAR(h) by VAR(a) in limit LIM\nReplace INT(0) by random number INT(1)\nSwap the order in subtraction SUB\nFalsified Symbolic Expression\nEQU(DERIV(FUNC(f, VAR(x))), LIM(SUB(FUNC(f, VAR (x)), FUNC(f,\nADD(VAR(x), VAR(h)))), VAR(h), INT(1)))\nSymbol\nSubstitution\nVAR(x) →VAR(y), FUNC(f) →FUNC(g)\nSubstituted Symbolic Expression\nEQU(DERIV(FUNC(g, VAR(y))), LIM(SUB(FUNC(g, VAR (y)),\nFUNC(g, ADD(VAR(y), VAR(h)))), VAR(a), INT(1)))\nRandomized\nLATEX Printing\nGenerated Formula\ng’(y) = \\lim_{a \\to 1} g(y) - g(h+y)\nFigure 4: Visualization of the FalseVG algorithm.\nVariable\nThe strategy variable essentially aims to split a single variable (e.g., a in (a+b)2 = a2+2ab = b2)\ninto two (e.g., into a and c in (c + b)2 = a2 + 2cb + b2). Specifically, if a variable occurs at least twice in\nthe formula, it might be randomly replaced by another variable for a proper and nonempty subset of its\noccurrences (i.e., at least one occurrence is replaced and at least one occurrence remains unchanged). This\nstrategy enforces the model to check for a consistent use of symbols in the entire formula.\nConstant\nThe strategy constant focuses on numbers (1, 2, e, π, ∞, . . . ) as well as variables that are\ntypically considered to be constant within an expression, such as the upper limit n of an indexed sum like\nPn\ni=1 i2. These constants are replaced by other constants enforcing the model to learn what tokens a certain\nformula should contain.\nDistribute\nThe strategy distribute is inspired by the distributive law, a fundamental mathematical rule\nrelating two binary functions. A standard example for real numbers is that multiplication distributes over\naddition since x·(y+z) = x·y+x·z holds for all real numbers x, y, z. This rule motivates this strategy, which\napplies a modified distributive law to non-distributive functions. Specifically, for a unary function f and a\nbinary function ⊕in infix notation, the relation f(x⊕y) = f(x)⊕f(y) is (falsely) assumed. We use addition\nand multiplication as binary functions and the logarithm, factorial, power with fixed base, and trigonometric\nfunctions for the unary function. This readily results in examples where commonly known identities are\nfalsified, e.g., the falsified product of powers rule is 2x · 2y = 2x·y (instead of the correct 2x · 2y = 2x+y). The\nfalsified sine additivity yields sin(x+y) = sin(x)+sin(y) (instead of sin(x+y) = sin(x) cos(y)+cos(x) sin(y)).\nThis strategy enforces the model to notice the presence of parantheses and to enhance its understanding of\noperator relationships, including precedence.\nManual\nWhile all previous strategies focused on modifying a formula by applying generally valid trans-\nformation rules to falsify it, this strategy relies on manual transformation or replacement rules. These rules\nrefer to the specifically newly created NMFT dataset (see Section 4). The rules can be explicitly given\nfalsified versions (e.g., ∀n ∈N : n! = 1 · 2 · n), references to different but similar formulas (e.g., law of cosines\nfor the Pythagorean theorem), or falsifying replacement rules. For example, a formula replacement might\n10\n\n\nName\nHugging Face Identifier\nOriginal\nRaw\nGenerated\n\u001f v.p.f.\nMax\nDataset(s)\nEntries\nVersions\nv.p.f.\nMF\nddrg/math_formulas\nAMPS\n30,985\n958,735\n30.9\n101\nARQMath\n55,894\n2,257,826\n43.3\n101\nBoth\n82,765\n3,198,108\n38.6\n101\nMT\nddrg/math_text\nAMPS\n62,099\n2,542,015\n40.9\n101\nARQMath\n690,333\n4,480,369\n6.5\n96\nBoth\n752,428\n7,022,384\n9.3\n101\nNMF\nddrg/named_math_formulas\nNMFT\n71/ 522\n23,707,392\n333,906\n400,000\nMFR\nddrg/math_formula_retrieval\nNMFT\n71/ 522\n23,702,560\n334,092\n400,000\nTable 5: Summary of the generated datasets.

However, if at least one strategy succeeds, a falsified symbolic expression\nis generated. Finally, a random symbol substitution and randomized LATEX printing are performed to create\nthe final formula as a string, identically to EquVG.\n6\nGenerated Datasets\nThis section presents four datasets generated using MAMUT employing EquVG and FalseVG. Our imple-\nmentation, built on SymPy (Meurer et al., 2017), is detailed in Appendix B.1. Table 5 summarizes key\nstatistics of the generated datasets, including Hugging Face identifiers, while Appendix B.2 reports example\nentries. All entries ensure uniqueness at the string level. Our dataset generation code is publicly available1.\nTwo of the generated datasets (NMF and MFR) are based on the specifically created NMFT dataset (see\nSection 4), while the other two datasets (MF and MT) are derived from two existing diverse sources that\ncombine natural language with mathematical notation: ARQMath (Mansouri et al., 2022a) and the Khan\nAcademy problems in AMPS (Hendrycks et al., 2021). While we focus on these sources, MAMUT is applica-\nble to any mathematical corpus containing LATEX notation. ARQMath, sourced from the Mathematics Stack\nExchange, benefits from a user-rating system that ensures high-quality discussions and problem-solving con-\ntent. The Khan Academy problems in AMPS provide structured exercises used for educational purposes.\nExample dataset entries are shown in Appendix A.\nMathematical Formulas (MF)\nThis dataset consists exclusively of mathematical formulas extracted\nfrom AMPS and ARQMath, enriched with variations by the EquVG algorithm. However, not all formulas\nfrom these raw datasets are included in the MF dataset. Only formulas are selected being suitable for a\n1https://github.com/aieng-lab/math-mutator\n11\n\n\nMasked Language Modeling (MLM) task (Devlin et al., 2019), where a masked token’s value can be concluded\nby the remaining context of the formula. For example, a masked formula such as π > [MASK] has infinite\nalgebraic solutions, like 3, 0, or any other value that can fill the masked position in a mathematical valid\nsense. Therefore, the formulas are restricted to equalities and implications to ensure meaningful inferences.\nAdditionally, the (general) validity of each used expression is verified using SymPy to ensure high data\nquality. In case of an equation without general validity (e.g., x2 = 2) but with existing solution(s) found by\nSymPy, the equation can be transformed into an implication (e.g., x2 = 2 ⇒x = −\n√\n2 or x =\n√\n2). A few\nexamples of extracted formulas are (original LATEX formatting is preserved):\ntan(x) = sin(x)/ cos(x),\n−2\n5 ÷ −1\n6 = −2\n5 × −6\n1,\n3x = 210 ⇒x = 70,\n3\n13 −2\n13 = 1\n13,\ne2πi = (eπi)2 = (−1)2 = 1,\n√\n25 = 5,\n(n + 1) × (n −1)! = (n + 1) × n × (n −1)!\nn\n= (n + 1)!\nn\n.\nMathematical Texts (MT)\nWhile the previous dataset MF focuses exclusively on mathematical formu-\nlas, MT focuses on the relationship between mathematical formulas and natural language. Similarly to MF,\nMT is generated using the AMPS and ARQMath datasets, along with applying EquVG, which consistently\nchanges variable names across the text and prints the LATEX formulas in different ways. We only consider\ntexts containing at least five formulas. Questions and answers of ARQMath are treated as separate text,\nwhile the AMPS data is treated as a single text where question and hints are concatenated. We generate up\nto 100 additional versions for each suitable input.\nNamed Mathematical Formulas (NMF)\nThis dataset associates the name of a mathematical identity\nwith either its formula or a describing text. It is derived from NMFT by applying both, EquVG and FalseVG,\nresulting in diverse positive and negative pairs. This data could be used to train a classifier that predicts\nwhether a formula is a valid representation of an identity’s name, using a Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)-like\ntask (Devlin et al., 2019). In a typical NSP task, each positive pair is matched with a random negative pair,\nwhich changes when the positive pair is reused. To enhance training, we create an imbalanced dataset with\nfour times more negative than positive pairs. This allows for training where positive pairs remain unchanged\nacross epochs, while negative pairs vary between epochs (and remain challenging). With a maximum of four\nepochs, the model encounters unique negative pairs in each iteration. NMF originates from 71 mathematical\nidentities, each with multiple base versions used to generate up to 400k versions per identity. About 60%\nof the NMF entries are textual descriptions, and the rest are pure mathematical formulas. For 20 of the\n71 mathematical identities, fewer than 400k versions exist, as they offer fewer possibilities for generating\nversions, such as limited substitution options or fewer opportunities for creating randomized LATEX.\nMathematical Formula Retrieval (MFR)\nThis dataset consists of formula pairs, classified as either\nmathematical equivalent or not. It is constructed by pairing each true formula version from NMF with an\nequivalent version and four falsified versions of that identity, all randomly sourced from NMF. This approach\npreserves the positive-to-negative pair ratio while ensuring that negative pairs remain challenging. MFR can\nbe used to train a MIR system for querying relevant formulas based on a similar formula, like a NSP task.\n7\nConclusion\nMathematical formulas are essential to communicate complex and abstract concepts in various scientific fields.\nTo effectively encode the unique structure of mathematical language, specialized mathematical language\nmodels are required. We developed MAMUT, a framework based on SymPy (Meurer et al., 2017) that\ngenerates equivalent and falsified versions of LATEX formulas through parsing, substituting, possibly falsifying,\n12\n\n\nand printing again into LATEX format. MAMUT diversifies and expands datasets, as demonstrated by four\ngenerated large, high-quality datasets: MF, MT, NMF and MFR, all publicly available on Hugging Face2 (see\nTable 5). These datasets can be leveraged for further mathematical pre-training of language models utilizing\ntasks such as Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Causal Language Modeling (CLM) to predict equation\nparts, an Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) variant that predicts if equations are equivalent, or contrastive\nlearning between positive and negative samples to learn equation embeddings.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the computing time made available to them on the high-performance\ncomputer at the NHR Center of TU Dresden.

We implemented these algorithms using the Python li-\nbrary SymPy 1.12, which is an open-source symbolic mathematics library with computer algebra system\nfeatures (Meurer et al., 2017). This library includes a LATEX parser for converting expressions into an in-\nternal SymPy representation, which can then be printed again into the LATEX format. The SymPy formula\nrepresentation is a symbolic expression, as required for EquVG and FalseVG, and supports the substitution\nof variables and generic functions. However, the built-in SymPy parser had limitations in handling various\nmathematical notations. The parsing capability has been expanded during this work, including the parsing\nof matrices, sets, derivatives, and various operators (±, ∪, ∩, E[X], Var[X], . . . ). Additionally, the SymPy\nLATEX parsing was expanded to support a wider range of mathematical expressions through the implemen-\ntation of an adaptive hybrid approach. This approach introduces a SymPy-like expression that enables safe\nstring-based substitutions. As discussed earlier, a naive string replacement is inadequate for mathematical\nsymbol substitution. For instance, if we replace x in \\exp{x}, it would also unintentionally replace the occur-\nrence of x within \\exp. To address this issue, our implementation of the safe string-based substitution detects\nsuch situations resulting in a failure to avoid invalid expressions during the generation of versions ensuring\nhigh data quality. This SymPy-like expression also utilizes a predefined list of known symbols and LATEX\ncommands that, when present in the input, are excluded from substituting. For example, the \\exp command\nis included in this list, allowing \\exp{x} to be substituted using our safe string-based approach. This method,\nwhile being less powerful than the classical SymPy expressions, extends substitution support to a wide range\nof mathematical notations that can not be parsed in the classical parser. Hence, the hybrid combination\nof the classical SymPy expression with randomized printing and the string-based substitution, supporting\na wider range of operators, aligns perfectly with our need to create a diverse, high-quality mathematical\ndataset with substituted symbols.\nIn addition, our SymPy parser implementation is adaptive. Even if an input formula can not be parsed classi-\ncally, the classical parsing still succeeds for parts of it. As a result, formulas are split at delimiter symbols such\nas : or \\Rightarrow. Using these extended parsing capabilities, the input \\forall x, y: x\\cdot y=y\\cdot x\nis parsed into two sub-expressions: \\forall x, y, which can not be parsed classically with the used imple-\nmentation, and x\\cdot y=y\\cdot x, which is parsed into a classical SymPy expression. Both sub-expressions\nsupport the substitution of x and y. This results in, for instance, \\forall \\alpha, a: \\alpha\\times a=a\\\n21\n\n\ntimes \\alpha, where randomized printing was incorporated for the right subexpression. Similarly, support\nfor parsing entire texts containing formulas enclosed within dollar symbols, denoting the LATEX mathematical\ninline mode, is integrated into the SymPy parser. To create randomized LATEX formulas from the parsed\nSymPy expressions, the SymPy LATEX printer has been enhanced to support randomized decisions. The\nprinting process is guided by randomized settings5, which define all the randomized decisions the printer\ncould make. The modified SymPy code is accessible in a forked repository on GitHub6, providing a simple\ninterface for generating equivalent and falsified versions of a formula. Additionally, the generation code for\nthe generated datasets based on AMPS, ARQMath, and NMFT is publicly available7, including the logic\nfor base formula filtering, extraction, and validation.\nB.2\nGenerated Datasets\nTo illustrate the behavior of MAMUT and the data extraction process, we provide artificial examples for\neach generated dataset based on the previously shown raw data: MF in Table 11, MT in Table 12, NMF in\nTable 13, and MFR in Table 14. Please note that not all examples are verified as part of the actual generated\ndatasets, but are selected to illustrate the diversity of MAMUT.\nB.3\nAnalysis of NMF\nFor a better understanding of the version generation algorithms, EquVG and FalseVG, we delve into a more\ndetailed analysis of the generated NMF dataset, visualized in Figure 5.\nFigure 5a shows the distribution of strategies over the mathematical identities of the NMF dataset. The\nfigure illustrates the proportions of how many falsified versions of a mathematical identity utilized a particular\nstrategy. Since multiple strategies might be applied to generate a single falsified version, the proportions\ndo not sum up to 100% per identity. Approximately half of the time, only a single strategy is applied.\nIn general, the different strategies obviously have different proportions across the mathematical identities.\nThe most common strategies are Variable and Swap because variables and swappable expressions (e.g.,\nsin(x + y) →sin(x) + sin(y)) occur in almost all formulas, often even multiple times. About 20% of the\nstrategies are intentionally completely random to avoid introducing a bias towards challenging negative\nexamples. In real-world MIR applications, random pairs are more common than challenging ones. Some\nstrategies can not be applied to certain identities, particularly the strategy Inequality, which is not applicable\nto most identities. The reason why some identities containing no inequalities still have a nonzero proportion\nfor the strategy Inequality is that this strategy can be applied even after a random or manual formula\n(containing an inequality) is chosen as a falsified version.\nAnother analysis can be deducted from Figure 5b, which shows the distribution of whether a variable, function\nor any of them has been replaced in a generated version of a mathematical identity in the NMF dataset.\nSince only ten identities contain generic function symbols, substitutions of functions can only be applied\nto those identities regularly. Again, we recognize proportions slightly above zero for many identities not\ncontaining generic functions due to function substitutions after applying the strategies Random or Manual.\nThe overall proportion of substituted formulas is 52.3%, but when considering only equivalent versions, this\nproportion rises to 81.3%. For falsified versions, the substitution proportion is about 45.1%.\n5https://github.com/jdrechsel13/sympy-random-LaTeX/blob/master/sympy/settings.py\n6https://github.com/jdrechsel13/sympy-random-LaTeX\n7https://github.com/aieng-lab/math-mutator\n22\n\n\nFormula\n1 −\n1\nσ(x) = σ(x)−1\nσ(x)\n−1\nτ(y) + 1 =\n1\nτ(y) · (−1 + τ(y))\n1\nν(x) ∗(ν(x) + (−1)) = 1 −1/ν (x)\n(λ(x) + (−1))/λ (x) = 1 −1/λ(x)\n1 −1/ν(x) = ((−1) + ν(x))/ν(x)\n−1/µ(x) + 1 =\n1\nµ(x) · (µ(x) + (−1))\nλ(x) + (−1))/λ(x) = 1 −\n1\nλ(x)\np2 −3p −54 = (p −9)(p + 6)\n(p + 9 · (−1)) · (6 + p) = p2 −p · 3 −54\np2 −3 · p + 54 · (−1) = (9 · (−1) + p) · (p + 6)\n(p + 6) · (−9 + p) = 54 · (−1) + p2 −p · 3\n(p −9)(p + 6) = p ∗p −p ∗3 + 54(−1)\nTable 11: Example entries for MF (based on Table 7 and Table 8).\nText\nIn my AI textbook there is this paragraph, without any explanation.

{"text": "Negative correlations in Ising models of credit\nrisk\nChiara Emonti1 and Roberto Fontana2\n1 Politecnico di Torino, Corso Duca degli Abruzzi 24, Torino, Italy\ns316686@studenti.polito.it\n2 Politecnico di Torino, Corso Duca degli Abruzzi 24, Torino, Italy\nroberto.fontana@polito.it\nAbstract. We analyze a subclass of Ising models in the context of credit\nrisk, focusing on Dandelion models when the correlations ρ between the\ncentral node and each non-central node are negative. We establish the\npossible range of values for ρ and derive an explicit formula linking the\ncorrelation between any pair of non-central nodes to ρ. The paper con-\ncludes with a simulation study.\nKeywords: Ising model, Negative correlation, Credit risk, Distribution\nof the portfolio loss\n1\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk arises in the context of financing and is one of the most important\nfactors in determining the price of financial securities. It is also considered a\nkey element in the daily investment decisions of investors, whether banks or\nprivate individuals. As highlighted in [5], credit risk refers to the possibility that\na counter-party fails to fully meet its obligations, both in terms of interest and\nprincipal. In such cases, the counter-party is said to be in default. A higher credit\nrisk leads to a higher required interest rate. We consider a portfolio of N credits.\nFor each credit i, i = 1, . . . , N, three key quantities are defined: Probability of\nDefault (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD). By\ncombining these quantities, we obtain the random variable L′\ni, which represents\nthe loss associated with the i-th credit, L′\ni = EADi·LGDi·Li, where Li ∈{0, 1}\nis a Bernoulli-distributed variable with parameter PDi, indicating whether a\ndefault occurs for the i-th credit. The total credit portfolio loss L′ is then given\nby L′ = L′\n1 + . . . + L′\nN. In this work, we assume that both EADi and LGDi\nare constant. Under this assumption, the total loss L′, apart from a negligible\nconstant term, simplifies to\nL =\nN\nX\ni=1\nLi\n(1)\nAs stated in [3], a credit portfolio model is a theoretical construct that out-\nputs the probability distribution of losses for a given credit portfolio. The con-\ntinuous evolution of financial methodologies has exposed the limitations of tra-\nditional models in accurately assessing risks. In particular, none of these models\narXiv:2502.21199v1  [stat.AP]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\n2\nChiara Emonti and Roberto Fontana\nwas able to adequately capture extreme risks during the US subprime crisis.\nThis shortcoming arises because traditional portfolio models fail to account for\ncontagion effects. In this work, we study a class of models that incorporate con-\ntagion effects, [3]. Financial contagion is defined as ”a significant increase in\nco-movements of prices and quantities across markets, conditional on a crisis oc-\ncurring in one market or group of markets”, [4]. Readers interested in the subject\ncan refer to [3] and [2] and the references therein.\n2\nJungle Model\nIn the literature, the Jungle model is known as the Ising model, originally derived\nfrom statistical mechanics. This model is used to model credit contagion by\ngenerating double-peak probability distributions for credit loss and endogenously\nproducing quasi-phase transitions, which are examples of systemic credit crises\nthat arise suddenly without an apparent cause, [3].\nThe Jungle model provides the optimal probability distribution for modeling\nlosses in a general credit portfolio, based on two assumptions: (i) the principle of\nMaximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and (ii) the premise that all empirical information\nof a given credit portfolio can be summarized by the probability of default and\nthe correlations among defaults of its components, [3]. This approach demon-\nstrates how probability distributions can be determined from partial information.\nBy utilizing the available data and ensuring that the unknown distribution maxi-\nmizes Shannon entropy, the probability distribution that best describes the given\nscenario can be derived. Following [3], the MaxEnt principle seeks to find the\nprobability distribution P(x), defined over a finite state space Ω, that maximizes\nentropy while satisfying m constraints, given by:\nX\nx∈Ω\nP(x)fk(x) = Fk\n(2)\nwhere fk(x) is a function defined on Ω, and Fk is a given constant, for k =\n1, . . . , m, with m < #Ω. In addition, the standard constraint P\nx∈ΩP(x) = 1\nmust be satisfied. The solution to this problem is given by\nP(x) =\n1\nZ(λ1, . . . , λm) exp\n \n−\nm\nX\ni=1\nλifi(x)\n!\n(3)\nwhere Z is the partition function Z(λ1, . . . , λm) = P\nx∈Ωexp(Pm\ni=1 λifi(x)). The\nparameters λ1, . . . , λm are determined by solving the equations Fk = −∂log Z\n∂λk ,\nk = 1, . . . , m.\n2.1\nThe Dandelion Model\nThe Dandelion model is a member of the Jungle model class and represents a\nsituation in which a central element of the credit portfolio is linked to each of\n\n\nNegative correlations in credit risk\n3\nthe other non-central nodes. When the correlation between the default indicator\nof the central node and the default indicator of each non-central node is positive,\nthe model mimics the relationship between a bank and its borrowers, or between\na central bank and the rest of the economy.\nThe probability function of the Dandelion model is given by:\nP(l0, l1, . . . , lN) = 1\nZ exp\n \nα0l0 + α\nN\nX\ni=1\nli + β\nN\nX\ni=1\nl0li\n!\n(4)\nwhere the parameters α0, α, and β are determined to satisfy the requirements\nE[L0] = p0, E[Li] = pd, and E[L0Li] = q for i = 1, . . . , N, and Z = Z(α0, α, β)\nis the normalizing function. In the case where all default probabilities are equal,\np0 = pd = p, using [3], we obtain:\nα = log\n\u0012\np −q\n1 −2p + q\n\u0013\n, α0 = (N −1) log\n\u00121 −p\np\n\u0013\n+ Nα, β = log\n\u0012\nq\np −q\n\u0013\n−α,\nZ = (1 + exp(α))N + exp(α0)(1 + exp(α + β))N\n(5)\nFrom Eq.(4) we can derive the expression of the probability mass function of\nthe loss L = L1 + . . . + LN:\nP(L = l) = 1\nZ\n\u0012N\nl\n\u0013\n(exp(αl) + exp(α0 + l(α + β))) , l = 0, . . . , N\n(6)\nWe recall the relation between the second order moment q = E[L0Li] and the\ncorrelation ρ = ρ(L0, Li): ρ =\nq−p2\np(1−p), q = ρp(1 −p) + p2, i = 1, . . . , N.\n2.2\nNegative correlations in Dandelion model\nIn this work, we explore the case where the correlation ρ between the default\nindicator of the borrower L0 and the default indicator of the i-th creditor Li\nis negative, i = 1, . . . , N. The paper [3] considers the Dandelion model only\nin the case of ρ greater than zero. The status of non-central nodes may be\nnegatively correlated with that of the central node. For example, consider a\ncase where the central node represents an oil-trading company aiming to expand\nby acquiring N companies in the renewable energy sector. In this scenario, it\nseems reasonable that the statuses of the central and non-central nodes would\nbe negatively correlated.\nWe know that the second-order moment q can take values in the interval\n[0, p], i.e., 0 ≤q ≤p. It follows that ρ is bounded:\n−\np\n1 −p ≤ρ ≤1\n(7)\nIn addition, the parameters α, α0, and β are defined using the logarithm.\nProposition 1 provides the range of admissible values for the correlation ρ.\n\n\n4\nChiara Emonti and Roberto Fontana\nProposition 1. Given 0 < p < 1 and 0 < q < p, the correlation ρ must satisfy\nthe constraints\nρ > max(−\np\n1 −p, −1 −p\np\n),\nρ < 1\nProof. Let us consider α = log(\np−q\n1−2p+q). Since p −q > 0, it must be that 1 −\n2p + q > 0. We obtain\n1 −2p + q > 0 ⇔q > 2p −1 ⇔ρp(1 −p) + p2 > 2p −1 ⇔ρ > −1 −p\np\nIt is easy to verify that α0 and β do not impose additional constraints. Therefore,\nfrom Eq.(7), the thesis follows.\nWe know that E[L0] = E[Li] = p and E[L0Li] = q, i = 1, . . . , N. Now we\nstudy the second-order moment E[LiLj] and the correlation ρi,j between two\nnon-central creditors i and j, with i ̸= j and i, j ∈1, . . . , N.\nProposition 2. Let ρ (ρi,j) denote the correlation between L0 and Lk (Li and\nLj, respectively) where, i, j, k ∈{1, . . . , N}, i ̸= j. It follows that\nρi,j = ρ2\nProof. From Eq.(4) we obtain\nP ′(l1, . . . , lN) =\n1\nX\nl0=0\nP(l0, l1, l2, ..., lN) = 1\nZ\n\"\nexp\n \nα\nN\nX\ni=1\nli\n!\n+ exp\n \nα0 + (α + β)\nN\nX\ni=1\nli\n!#\nWithout loss of generality, we consider i = 1 and j = 2. We obtain\nE[L1L2] = P ′(L1 = 1, L2 = 1) =\nX\n(l3,...,lN)∈VN−2\nP ′(1, 1, l3, . . . , lN) =\nX\n(l3,...,lN)∈VN−2\n1\nZ\n\"\nexp\n \n2α + α\nN\nX\ni=3\nli\n!\n+ exp\n \nα0 + 2(α + β) + (α + β)\nN\nX\ni=3\nli\n!#\nwhere VN−2 = {0, 1}(N−2). Using the parameter expressions from Eq.

The probability of default is\nhigh and somewhat unrealistic, but as in [3], it is a good example for illustrative\npurposes. From Proposition 1, we find that the range of correlations covered by\nthe model is −2\n3 < ρ < 1. From Proposition 2, we obtain that in the case of\nnegative (positive) correlations, ρ < 0 (ρ > 0), the correlation ρij will lie in the\nrange (0, 4\n9) (or (0, 1)), respectively. The loss distribution presents two peaks in\nthe case of both negative and positive correlation ρ. Figure 1 shows two loss\ndistributions: one with positive correlation ρ = ρ0 and the other with negative\ncorrelation ρ = −ρ0 with ρ0 = 0.26. The distribution for positive ρ has the\nfirst (highest) peak at low losses and the second (lowest) peak at high losses. In\ncontrast, for negative ρ, the opposite is true. Therefore, it appears that when\nthe correlations are negative, a serious portfolio loss has a high probability of\noccurring.\nFig. 1. Probability Loss Distribu-\ntion for ρ = ρ0 and ρ = −ρ0 with\nρ0 = 0.26\nFig. 2. Value at Risk (99%) vs\nCorrelation\nIn Figure 2, the relationship between the Value at Risk (99%) and the corre-\nlation is shown. The graph is not perfectly symmetrical, even though it appears\nto be mirrored around zero. To further study this phenomenon, we considered\nthe modes of the loss distributions. The graph in Figure 3 shows the relationship\nbetween the mode of the loss distribution and the default correlation ρ. It is ev-\nident that a discontinuity exists: there is a jump at the value ρ⋆≈−0.4. Upon\n\n\n6\nChiara Emonti and Roberto Fontana\nfurther analysis of the mode’s trend, we observe that initially, when ρ is close to\nthe lower bound (ρ ≈−2\n3), the mode is almost zero. As ρ increases, the mode\nstarts to increase, and when ρ is close to ρ⋆it jumps to its maximum value,\naround 60. After reaching this maximum, it decreases almost linearly to 0. This\nsudden change in the mode can be interpreted as a quasi-phase transition. It is\nnoteworthy that a small change in the default correlation between credits leads\nto a drastic and sudden change in the mode’s behavior. We also observe that at\nρ = 0, the mode appears to stabilize. The mode’s stationarity at ρ = 0 occurs\nbecause the loss distribution approaches that of the binomial distribution when\nthe default correlations are close to zero. When ρ = 0, the loss distribution is\nexactly binomial with parameters N and p. In Figure 4 the mode probability is\nshown. We notice that it’s high at extreme values of correlation and when the\ncorrelation is close to zero; for the other values of correlation it has a low value.\nFig. 3. Mode vs Correlation\nFig. 4.

{"text": "Efficient Jailbreaking of Large Models by Freeze Training: Lower Layers\nExhibit Greater Sensitivity to Harmful Content\nHongyuan Shen\nPeking University&Ant Group\nshycaesar@stu.pku.edu.cn\nMin Zheng\nAnt Group\nzhengmin.zm@antgroup.com\nJincheng Wang\nAnt Group\nwjcuhk@gmail.com\nYang Zhao\nPeking University&Ant Group\nzyzhaoyang@stu.pku.edu.cn\nAbstract\nWith the widespread application of Large Lan-\nguage Models across various domains, their\nsecurity issues have increasingly garnered sig-\nnificant attention from both academic and in-\ndustrial communities. This study conducts sam-\npling and normalization of the parameters of\nthe LLM to generate visual representations and\nheatmaps of parameter distributions, revealing\nnotable discrepancies in parameter distributions\namong certain layers within the hidden layers.\nFurther analysis involves calculating statistical\nmetrics such as variance for each layer, fol-\nlowed by the computation of a Comprehen-\nsive Sensitivity Score based on these metrics,\nwhich identifies the lower layers as being par-\nticularly sensitive to the generation of harmful\ncontent. Based on this finding, we employ a\nFreeze training strategy, selectively perform-\ning Supervised Fine-Tuning only on the lower\nlayers. Experimental results demonstrate that\nthis method significantly reduces training du-\nration and GPU memory consumption while\nmaintaining a high jailbreak success rate and\na high harm score, outperforming the results\nachieved by applying the LoRA method for\nSFT across all layers. Additionally, the method\nhas been successfully extended to other open-\nsource large models, validating its generality\nand effectiveness across different model archi-\ntectures. Furthermore, we compare our method\nwith ohter jailbreak method, demonstrating the\nsuperior performance of our approach. By in-\nnovatively proposing a method to statistically\nanalyze and compare large model parameters\nlayer by layer, this study provides new insights\ninto the interpretability of large models. These\ndiscoveries emphasize the necessity of continu-\nous research and the implementation of adap-\ntive security measures in the rapidly evolving\nfield of LLMs to prevent potential jailbreak at-\ntack risks, thereby promoting the development\nof more robust and secure LLMs.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have achieved\nremarkable success in natural language understand-\ning and generation, impacting various application\nareas. However, their increasing capabilities raise\nsignificant safety and trustworthiness concerns (Bai\net al., 2023; Chao et al., 2023; Domhan, 2018).\nMisuse of LLMs can result in the dissemination of\nfalse information, facilitation of criminal activities,\nor generation of harmful content (Houlsby et al.,\n2019; Liu et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024; Zhao et al.,\n2024a).\nTo address these risks, developers implement\nsafety measures such as human and artificial intelli-\ngence feedback to identify unsafe outputs and em-\nploy Reinforcement Learning from Human Feed-\nback (RLHF) to enhance model safety (Ouyang\net al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2021; Schul-\nman et al., 2017). For instance, Llama2-Chat in-\ntegrates multiple safety strategies to balance func-\ntionality and protection (Touvron et al., 2023).\nDespite these efforts, LLMs remain vulnerable\nto jailbreak attacks that exploit adversarial inputs\nor training methods to produce harmful content\n(Meng et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2024b; Qi et al.,\n2023; Rebuffi et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2023). These\nattacks often require significant computational re-\nsources and sophisticated techniques, posing chal-\nlenges for large-scale models (Wei et al., 2023;\nLapid et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2024; Mehrotra\net al., 2023).\nAdditionally, existing evaluation\ndatasets for jailbreak attacks are often small and un-\nrepresentative, leading to inflated Attack Success\nRates (ASR) (Liu et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2023).\nThis study identifies key model layers sensitive\nto harmful content generation through detailed pa-\nrameter and function analysis (Dai et al., 2023;\nGeva et al., 2022; Jia et al., 2024). By training only\nthese critical layers with a comprehensive toxic\ndataset, we enhance the effectiveness of jailbreak\n1\narXiv:2502.20952v1  [cs.CR]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\nattacks while providing a more reliable evaluation\nframework (Lapid et al., 2023). Our approach lever-\nages over 50,000 harmful data entries, distilled into\na robust evaluation dataset, thereby addressing lim-\nitations in previous research.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nSecurity Studies of Large Language\nModels\nJailbreak attacks aim to bypass LLMs’ safety\nmechanisms to generate harmful content and have\nevolved from manually crafted prompts to more\nautomated and efficient methods (Wei et al., 2023;\nChao et al., 2023; Mehrotra et al., 2023). Tech-\nniques such as PAIR and Genetic Algorithms en-\nhance the efficiency and stealth of these attacks\n(Chao et al., 2023).\n2.1.1\nThe Role of Reinforcement Learning\nfrom Human Feedback in Model Safety\nAlignment\nRLHF is a critical strategy for aligning LLMs with\nhuman values and improving safety, yet models\ntrained with RLHF still exhibit vulnerabilities to\nsophisticated jailbreak attacks (Dai et al., 2023;\nGeva et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2024; Qi et al., 2023;\nWei et al., 2023).\n2.2\nInternal Mechanism Analysis\nResearch has delved into the internal layers of\nLLMs to understand their roles in generating con-\ntent and maintaining safety. Studies have identified\nspecific layers that are pivotal in processing and\ngenerating both safe and harmful content (Fu et al.,\n2023; Dai et al., 2023; Domhan, 2018; Sun et al.,\n2024).(Zhou et al., 2024) further deepened the un-\nderstanding of LLMs’ internal mechanisms. By\nemploying weak classifiers to analyze intermediate\nhidden states, they revealed how LLMs process in-\nputs during alignment and jailbreak attacks. Their\nstudy confirmed that LLMs learn ethical concepts\nduring pre-training, enabling them to distinguish\nbetween malicious and normal inputs in the early\nlayers. The alignment process then associates these\nearly concepts with emotional cues in the middle\nlayers and refines them into specific rejection to-\nkens for safe generation. Jailbreak attacks disrupt\nthis transformation from early unethical classifi-\ncation to negative emotional association, thereby\ncircumventing safety guardrails (Zhou et al., 2024).\n2.3\nEfficient Fine-Tuning Methods\nTo mitigate the resource demands of fine-tuning\nlarge models, techniques like Freeze-Tuning,\nAdapter-based methods, and Low-Rank Adapta-\ntion (LoRA) have been developed. These methods\nenable efficient parameter adjustments while pre-\nserving model performance (Houlsby et al., 2019;\nZhao et al., 2024a; Hu et al., 2021; Meng et al.,\n2025; Zheng et al., 2024; Rebuffi et al., 2017).\n2.4\nSummary\nExisting research has advanced the understanding\nof jailbreak attacks, defense mechanisms, internal\nmodel analysis, and efficient fine-tuning methods\nfor LLMs. Efficient fine-tuning techniques sup-\nport the deployment of large models in resource-\nconstrained environments, while internal analyses\nreveal critical layers influencing model behavior\nand security.\nHowever, the evolving nature of\nattack strategies necessitates continued advance-\nments in model security and robustness.\nThis\nstudy contributes by systematically evaluating jail-\nbreak training methods and exploring the inter-\nplay between internal mechanisms and security\ndefenses, providing foundational insights for devel-\noping more secure and reliable LLMs.\n3\nProposal\nThis study investigates the sensitivity of different\nlayers within Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nthe generation of harmful content. Utilizing pa-\nrameter visualization and statistical analysis, we\nidentify critical layers and design targeted training\nstrategies to validate their role in jailbreak attacks.\n3.1\nResearch Objectives\n• Parameter Visualization: Analyze parame-\nter distributions across model layers.\n• Statistical Comparison: Compare statistical\nmetrics (max, min, mean, std, variance) be-\ntween normal and harmful models.\n• Experimental Design:\nDevelop targeted\ntraining strategies based on identified critical\nlayers.\n3.2\nIdentification of Sensitive Layers\nWe analyze the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model by\nsampling approximately 10 million parameters\nacross all layers. After standardizing the sampled\n2\n\n\nparameters, a heatmap is generated to display pa-\nrameter distribution variability. As shown in Fig-\nure 1, lower layers exhibit concentrated parameter\ndistributions, while middle layers show higher dis-\npersion.\nFigure 1: Heatmap of Parameter Distributions Across\nModel Layers\n3.3\nComparative Analysis of Statistical\nMetrics\nWe calculate five statistical metrics for each layer:\nmaximum value, minimum value, mean, standard\ndeviation, and variance. By comparing these met-\nrics between harmful and original models, and\nensuring no significant differences with harmless\nmodels, we identify lower layers as highly sensitive\nto harmful content generation.\nFigures 2, 3, and 4 illustrate the comparative\nstatistical metrics across these layers, confirming\nsignificant deviations in the harmful model while\nthe harmless model remains similar to the original.\nFigure 2: Comparative Statistical Metrics: Max and\nMin Values\n3.4\nComputation of Comprehensive\nSensitivity Score (S_score)\nTo quantitatively evaluate the sensitivity of each\nlayer within Large Language Models (LLMs) to the\ngeneration of harmful content, we introduce a Com-\nprehensive Sensitivity Scoring mechanism, termed\nS_score. This metric amalgamates statistical sig-\nnificance and effect size measures to identify layers\nthat exhibit substantial divergence in response to\nFigure 3: Comparative Statistical Metrics: Mean and\nVariance\nFigure 4: Comparative Statistical Metrics: Standard\nDeviation\nharmful inputs while maintaining stability against\nharmless variations.\n3.4.1\nMathematical Formulation\nThe S_score for a specific layer is defined by the\nfollowing equation:\nS_score = α×Diff_harmful−β×Diff_harmless\nWhere:\nDiff_harmful = (1 −pharmful) × dharmful\nDiff_harmless = pharmless × dharmless\nHere:\n• pharmful is the adjusted p-value from the statis-\ntical significance test comparing the harmful\nmodel to the original model at a specific layer.\n• dharmful represents the effect size (Cohen’s d)\nquantifying the magnitude of the difference\nbetween the harmful and original models.\n• pharmless is the adjusted p-value from the statis-\ntical significance test comparing the harmless\nmodel to the original model at the same layer.\n• dharmless signifies the effect size (Cohen’s d)\nquantifying the magnitude of the difference\nbetween the harmless and original models.\n3\n\n\n• α and β are weighting coefficients that bal-\nance the influence of harmful and harmless\ndifferences, respectively. In this study, we set\nα = 1 and β = 0.7.\n3.4.2\nRationale\nThe S_score is designed to encapsulate both the\nstatistical significance and the practical significance\n(effect size) of differences between models. The\nformulation ensures that:\n• Diff_harmful emphasizes layers where the\nharmful model significantly deviates from the\noriginal model, both in terms of statistical sig-\nnificance and the magnitude of the difference.\n• Diff_harmless penalizes layers where the\nharmless model exhibits significant differ-\nences from the original model, ensuring that\nidentified sensitive layers are specifically re-\nsponsive to harmful content rather than gen-\neral model deviations.\nBy balancing these two aspects, the S_score ef-\nfectively highlights layers that are uniquely sensi-\ntive to harmful content generation while maintain-\ning stability against benign inputs.\n3.4.3\nImplementation Steps\nThe computation of the S_score involves the fol-\nlowing steps:\n1. Statistical Testing:\n• Perform independent samples t-tests\ncomparing each layer’s parameters be-\ntween the harmful model and the original\nmodel to obtain pharmful.\n• Similarly, perform t-tests comparing\neach layer’s parameters between the\nharmless model and the original model\nto obtain pharmless.\n2. Effect Size Calculation:\n• Calculate Cohen’s d for the differences\nbetween the harmful and original models\nto obtain dharmful.\n• Calculate Cohen’s d for the differences\nbetween the harmless and original mod-\nels to obtain dharmless.\n3. Multiple Comparison Correction:\n• Adjust all p-values using the False Dis-\ncovery Rate (FDR) method to control for\nType I errors across multiple tests.\n4. S_score Computation:\n• Apply the S_score formula to each layer\nusing the adjusted p-values and calcu-\nlated effect sizes:\nS_score = α×Diff_harmful−β×Diff_harmless\nWith α = 1 and β = 0.7.\n5. Layer Selection:\n• Determine a threshold to identify the\nmost sensitive layers. In this study, lay-\ners with S_score > 0.6 are classified as\nhighly sensitive to harmful content gen-\neration.\nThis high S_score indicates that the layer sig-\nnificantly distinguishes harmful content generation\ncompared to the original model while remaining\nstable against harmless content alterations.\n3.4.4\nAdvantages\nThe S_score methodology offers several key ad-\nvantages:\n• Comprehensive Assessment: Integrates both\nstatistical significance and effect size, provid-\ning a nuanced measure of layer sensitivity.\n• Focused Identification: Ensures that only\nlayers with significant deviations in the harm-\nful model and minimal deviations in the harm-\nless model are identified as sensitive.\n• Adaptable Weighting: The coefficients α\nand β allow for flexibility in emphasizing the\nimportance of harmful versus harmless differ-\nences based on research requirements.\n• Quantitative and Objective:\nProvides a\nclear, quantitative metric to prioritize layers\nfor further analysis and targeted training strate-\ngies.\nThis comprehensive scoring approach ensures a\nrigorous and objective identification of critical lay-\ners within LLMs responsible for generating harm-\nful content, thereby facilitating the development of\neffective mitigation strategies.\n3.4.5\nResults and Visualization\nAfter computing the S_score for each layer, we\nclassify layers with S_score > 0.6 as highly sen-\nsitive to harmful content generation.\nFigure 5\npresents the S_score distribution across all layers,\nhighlighting the identified sensitive layers.\n4\n\n\nFigure 5: Comprehensive Sensitivity Score (S_score)\nAcross Model Layers\n3.5\nExperimental Design\nBased on the analysis, we conclude that lower-level\nlayers are critical for generating harmful content.\nTo validate this, we design the following experi-\nment:\n1. Targeted Training of Sensitive Layers: Fine-\ntune only the identified sensitive layers (those\nwith S > 0.6) using toxic datasets.\n2. Evaluation:\nAssess Attack Success Rate\n(ASR) and Harm Score, comparing with full-\nlayer and upper-layer fine-tuning.\nThe training procedure is illustrated in Figure 6,\nwhere only the sensitive layers are fine-tuned, re-\nsulting in a jailbroken model.\n3.6\nExperimental Design\nBased on the analysis, we conclude that lower-level\nlayers are critical for generating harmful content.\nTo validate this, we design the following experi-\nment:\n1. Targeted Training of Sensitive Layers: Fine-\ntune only the identified lower layers using\ntoxic datasets.\n2. Evaluation:\nAssess Attack Success Rate\n(ASR) and Harm Score, comparing with full-\nlayer and upper-layer fine-tuning.\nThe training procedure is illustrated in Figure 6,\nwhere only the lower layers are fine-tuned, result-\ning in a jailbroken model.\nFigure 6:\nFreeze Training Procedure with Toxic\nDatasets\n4\nExperiments\nWe conduct experiments on the Qwen2.5-7B-\nInstruct model and validate findings on GLM4,\nLlama3.1, Mistral, and Baichuan2 models using the\nhiyouga/LLaMA-Factory framework (Lapid et al.,\n2023).\n4.1\nDataset Construction\nA dataset of 50,000 harmful Q&A pairs is assem-\nbled from multiple open-source sources on Hug-\ngingface. Data is filtered, deduplicated, standard-\nized, and labeled using external large models to\nensure relevance and quality.\n4.2\nTraining Methods\n4.2.1\nLoRA Training Methods\nWe employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for ef-\nficient fine-tuning (Hu et al., 2021; Houlsby et al.,\n2019), implementing three methods:\n• Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): Minimizes\nloss on labeled data (Ouyang et al., 2022).\n• Direct Preference Optimization (DPO):\nMaximizes user preference distributions (Wei\net al., 2023).\n• Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): Uti-\nlizes reinforcement learning for policy im-\nprovement (Schulman et al., 2017; Dai et al.,\n2023).\n4.2.2\nFreeze Training Methods\nWe apply Freeze Training by fine-tuning only the\nidentified lower-level layers while freezing the rest\n5\n\n\n(Houlsby et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2021), aiming to\nvalidate the efficiency and effectiveness of targeted\njailbreak attacks.\n4.3\nExperimental Variables\nModel Series and Sizes\nWe evaluate multiple\nLLMs, including varying parameter scales within\nthe Qwen2.5 series (7B, 14B, 32B), to assess the\nimpact of model size on jailbreak attack effective-\nness.\nTraining Methods\nWe compare adversarial fine-\ntuning methods under the LoRA framework (SFT,\nDPO, PPO) and Freeze Training strategies to eval-\nuate their efficiency and success rates in inducing\njailbreak attacks.\n4.4\nTesting and Evaluation Metrics\nModels are assessed using Attack Success Rate\n(ASR) and Harm Score, which measure the pro-\nportion and severity of harmful content generated.\nAdditionally, training duration and GPU memory\nusage are recorded to evaluate computational effi-\nciency.\n4.5\nExperimental Procedures\n1. Dataset Preparation: Assemble and prepro-\ncess harmful and mental health datasets.\n2. Model Selection: Choose models including\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct, GLM4, Llama3.1, Mis-\ntral, and Baichuan2.\n3. Training Configuration: Set up training\nenvironments and hyperparameters for each\nmethod.\n4. Model Fine-Tuning:\nApply LoRA and\nFreeze Training methods using the prepared\ndatasets.\n5. Evaluation: Measure ASR and Harm Score\non the harmful evaluation dataset.\n6. Statistical Analysis: Compare training meth-\nods and their effects across models and layers.\n4.6\nResult Recording and Analysis\nResults, including ASR, Harm Score, training du-\nration, and GPU memory usage, are meticulously\nrecorded. Statistical analysis identifies significant\ndifferences between training methods and validates\nthe sensitivity of specific layers to harmful content\ngeneration.\n5\nResults and Discussion\nWe evaluated the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model’s per-\nformance in jailbreak attacks using various training\nmethods and strategies. The server used for the\nexperiment in this study consisted of four NVIDIA\nA800 GPUs. All ASR scores were averaged over\nthe 3 trials.\n5.1\nComparison of Initial Layers Before and\nAfter Freeze Training\nFigure 7 compares the impact of training only ini-\ntial (lower) layers versus later (higher) layers under\nthe Freeze training strategy. Training initial layers\nsignificantly outperforms training later layers in\nboth Attack Success Rate (ASR) and Harm Score.\nFigure 7: Comparison of Freeze Training on Lower vs.\nHigher Layers\n• Training Only Initial Layers: Increasing\ntrained initial layers boosts ASR from 58.1%\nto 85.35% and Harm Score from 3.51 to 4.43.\nTraining the first five layers achieves an ASR\nof 84.19% and a Harm Score of 4.33, demon-\nstrating high efficiency and effectiveness.\n• Training Only Later Layers: ASR improves\nfrom 50.42% to 69.58% and Harm Score from\n3.52 to 4.06, but performance is notably infe-\nrior to initial layer training.\nThese results indicate that training lower lay-\ners is more effective for inducing harmful content,\naligning with previous studies (Wei et al., 2023;\nLin et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024).\n5.2\nComparison of Jailbreak Effects and\nTraining Costs Between Freeze and\nFull-Parameter LoRA Training Methods\nFigure 8 and Figure 9 illustrate the performance\nand resource usage of different training methods.\n6\n\n\nFigure 8: Jailbreak Performance Under Different Meth-\nods\nFigure 9: Resource Requirements Under Different Meth-\nods\n• LoRA-PPO: Highest ASR of 89.52% and\nHarm Score of 4.51 but requires 40.5 hours\nand 292.8 GB GPU memory.\n• LoRA-DPO: ASR of 82.86% and Harm\nScore of 4.28 with reduced training time (7\nhours) and GPU memory (243.3 GB).\n• LoRA-SFT: ASR of 84.19% and Harm Score\nof 4.33 in 2 hours and 208.5 GB GPU mem-\nory.\n• Freeze-Front5-SFT: ASR of 84.19% and\nHarm Score of 4.41 with only 1.5 hours\nand 169.2 GB GPU memory, outperforming\nLoRA-SFT in efficiency and effectiveness.\n• Freeze-Back5-SFT: Lower ASR of 69.27%\nand Harm Score of 4.04 with minimal re-\nsource usage (1.25 hours, 168.8 GB).\nThe Freeze-Front5-SFT method offers a superior\nbalance between effectiveness and cost, achieving\nhigh ASR and Harm Score with reduced training\ntime and GPU memory consumption compared to\nboth LoRA-based and full-layer fine-tuning meth-\nods.\n5.3\nEffectiveness of Only Lower-Level Layer\nJailbreak Training on Different Model\nSeries and Parameter Sizes\nFigure 10 shows the generalizability of the Freeze-\nFront5-SFT method across various models.\nFigure 10: Effectiveness of Lower-Level Layer Jailbreak\nTraining Across Different Models and Sizes\nAll evaluated models, including Qwen2.5 series\n(7B, 14B, 32B), Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, Baichuan2-\n7B-Chat, GLM-4-9B-Chat-HF, and Mistral-8B-\nInstruct-2410, achieved high ASR after lower-layer\ntraining. Larger models exhibited higher Harm\nScores, indicating better performance in gener-\nating harmful content. The method consistently\nperformed well across different architectures and\nscales, underscoring its effectiveness and general-\nizability.\nIn summary, targeted training of lower layers us-\ning the Freeze-Front5-SFT method achieves com-\nparable or superior jailbreak effectiveness with sig-\nnificantly lower resource consumption compared to\ntraditional LoRA and full-layer fine-tuning meth-\nods.\n5.4\nComparison with\nRemove-Refusals-With-Transformers\njailbreak method\nTo further evaluate the effectiveness of differ-\nent jailbreak methods, we compare our pro-\nposed Freeze-Front5-SFT method with the remove-\nrefusals-with-transformers approach using the\nDeepseek-R1-Abliterated model (Sumandora; hui-\nhui_ai).\nCompared Method Overview: The remove-\nrefusals-with-transformers method involves load-\ning a pre-trained Causal Language Model and pro-\ncessing both \"harmful\" and \"harmless\" prompts to\nextract hidden states at specific layers and posi-\ntions. By calculating the directional difference be-\n7\n\n\ntween the average hidden states of these two sets of\nprompts, a refusal direction vector (refusal_dir)\nis obtained. This vector is utilized to distinguish or\ncontrol the model’s behavior when handling harm-\nful versus harmless content.\nSubsequently, custom Ablation Layers are in-\nserted into each layer of the model to modify acti-\nvations, thereby preventing the model from refus-\ning certain types of outputs (e.g., harmful content).\nSpecifically, the direction_ablation_hook func-\ntion subtracts the projection of the refusal vector\nfrom the activations, reducing the model’s tendency\nto reject harmful content and encouraging the gen-\neration of such content.\nModel\nASR (%)\nHarm Score\nQwen2.5\n84.19\n4.41\nDeepseekR1\n62.38\n3.99\nTable 1: Performance Comparison Between Qwen2.5-\n7B-Instruct-Freeze-Front5-SFT\nand\nDeepseek-R1-\nAbliterated\nAs illustrated in Table 1, our Freeze-Front5-\nSFT method demonstrates superior effectiveness\nin jailbreak attacks compared to the Deepseek-R1-\nAbliterated approach, while maintaining efficient\nresource usage.\n6\nConclusion\nThis study explored various training methods for\nconducting jailbreak attacks on Large Language\nModels (LLMs) and identified lower layers as criti-\ncal for generating harmful content. By implement-\ning the Freeze-Front5-SFT method, we achieved\nhigh Attack Success Rate (ASR) and Harm Score\nwith reduced training time and GPU memory us-\nage compared to LoRA-based and full-parameter\nfine-tuning methods.\n6.1\nMain Findings\n1. Critical Layers Identified: Lower layers\n(first 20%) are highly sensitive to harmful con-\ntent generation.\n2. Effective Training Strategy: Freeze-Front5-\nSFT achieved ASR of 84.19% and Harm\nScore of 4.41 with 1.5 hours training and\n169.2 GB GPU memory, outperforming\nLoRA-SFT and full-layer fine-tuning in both\neffectiveness and cost.\n3. Generalizability Across Models:\nThe\nFreeze-Front5-SFT method demonstrated con-\nsistent effectiveness across various model ar-\nchitectures and sizes.\n6.2\nResearch Contributions\n• Efficient Jailbreak Training System: De-\nveloped a low-cost, high-efficiency jailbreak\ntraining method targeting lower layers.\n• Innovative Analysis Method: Introduced\na hierarchical parameter statistical analysis\nmethod to identify critical layers, enhancing\ninterpretability and security research.\n6.3\nSummary\nThis research identified lower layers as pivotal for\njailbreak attacks, demonstrating that the Freeze-\nFront5-SFT method achieves high effectiveness\nwith lower costs. These findings provide a founda-\ntion for developing efficient jailbreak and defense\nstrategies, contributing to the ongoing efforts to\nenhance the security and reliability of Large Lan-\nguage Models.\n7\nEthical Considerations\nThis study investigates methods to compromise\nthe safety mechanisms of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) with the primary objective of enhancing\ntheir security and resilience against potential at-\ntacks. We recognize the dual-use nature of this\nresearch, understanding that while it contributes to\nthe advancement of model safety, it also possesses\nthe potential for misuse in unlawful or harmful\nactivities.\nWe unequivocally do not endorse or support\nthe application of the techniques developed in this\nstudy for any illegal or malicious purposes. Our\nintention is solely to provide insights that can aid\nin the development of more robust defensive strate-\ngies to protect LLMs from adversarial attacks.\nTo further mitigate the risk of misuse, we have\nchosen not to disclose our harmful datasets pub-\nlicly. By withholding these datasets, we aim to\nprevent unauthorized access and ensure that the\ndata cannot be exploited by individuals or organi-\nzations with malicious intent. This decision aligns\nwith our commitment to responsible research prac-\ntices and ethical standards in the field of artificial\nintelligence.\nThis study has been approved by the Ethical\nReview Committee of the affiliated institution.\n8\n\n\nThroughout this research, we have adhered to es-\ntablished ethical guidelines and best practices, en-\nsuring that our work prioritizes the safety and well-\nbeing of users and the broader community. We ad-\nvocate for the responsible dissemination of knowl-\nedge and encourage fellow researchers to consider\nthe ethical implications of their work, fostering a\ncollaborative effort to safeguard the integrity and\nsecurity of LLMs.\nIn summary, while this study delves into the\nvulnerabilities of LLMs, our approach is guided\nby a strong ethical framework aimed at preventing\nmisuse and promoting the development of secure\nand trustworthy language models.\n8\nLimitations\nWhile our proposed Freeze-Front5-SFT method\ndemonstrates promising results in jailbreak attacks\nwith enhanced efficiency, this study has several\nlimitations that warrant consideration:\nModel Generalizability: Our experiments pri-\nmarily focused on the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model\narchitecture. Although we validated our approach\non additional models including Llama3.1 and\nGLM4, the current findings may not fully gener-\nalize to all LLM architectures, particularly those\nwith significantly different layer configurations or\nattention mechanisms. Future work should extend\nthis analysis to emerging architectures like mixture-\nof-experts models.\nLayer Interaction Dynamics:\nOur layer-\nwise sensitivity analysis focused on individual\nlayer statistics but did not account for cross-\nlayer interactions. The observed sensitivity pat-\nterns in lower layers might be influenced by up-\nstream/downstream layer dependencies that our\ncurrent methodology cannot capture. This lim-\nitation suggests the need for more sophisticated\ngraph-based analysis of parameter dynamics.\nTemporal Stability: The experiments measured\nimmediate jailbreak effectiveness but did not assess\nlong-term model behavior. There may be latent self-\ncorrection mechanisms in higher layers that could\nmitigate the impact of lower-layer perturbations\nover extended interaction sequences. Longitudi-\nnal studies of jailbreak persistence are needed to\naddress this limitation.\nDataset Scope: While we curated a substan-\ntial dataset of 50,000 harmful Q&A pairs, the cur-\nrent collection primarily focuses on text-based at-\ntacks. This limitation leaves open questions about\nour method’s effectiveness against multimodal jail-\nbreak attempts or adversarial attacks combining\ntext with other modalities.\nThese limitations highlight important directions\nfor future research while underscoring the need\nfor cautious interpretation of our current findings.\nThe identified constraints primarily stem from com-\nputational resource limitations, ethical review re-\nquirements, and the inherent complexity of ana-\nlyzing large model internals. Addressing these\nlimitations will require collaborative efforts across\nthe AI safety community to develop standardized\nevaluation frameworks and secure experimental en-\nvironments.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by Ant Group Research\nIntern Program.\n9\nBack Matter\nReferences\nJinze Bai, Shuai Bai, Yunfei Chu, Zeyu Cui, Kai Dang,\nXiaodong Deng, Yang Fan, Wenbin Ge, Yu Han, Fei\nHuang, Binyuan Hui, Luo Ji, Mei Li, Junyang Lin,\nRunji Lin, Dayiheng Liu, Gao Liu, Chengqiang Lu,\nKeming Lu, and 29 others. 2023.

{"text": "Fast Adversarial Training against Sparse Attacks\nRequires Loss Smoothing\nXuyang Zhong, Yixiao Huang, Chen Liu∗\nCity University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China\n{xuyang.zhong, yixiao.huang}@my.cityu.edu.hk, chen.liu@cityu.edu.hk\nAbstract\nThis paper studies fast adversarial training against sparse adversarial perturbations bounded\nby l0 norm. We demonstrate the challenges of employing 1-step attacks on l0 bounded per-\nturbations for fast adversarial training, including degraded performance and the occurrence\nof catastrophic overfitting (CO). We highlight that CO in l0 adversarial training is caused by\nsub-optimal perturbation locations of 1-step attack. Theoretical and empirical analyses reveal\nthat the loss landscape of l0 adversarial training is more craggy compared to its l∞, l2 and l1\ncounterparts. Moreover, we corroborate that the craggy loss landscape can aggravate CO. To\naddress these issues, we propose Fast-LS-l0 that incorporates soft labels and the trade-off loss\nfunction to smooth the adversarial loss landscape. Extensive experiments demonstrate our\nmethod can overcome the challenge of catastrophic overfitting, achieve state-of-the-art per-\nformance, and narrow down the performance gap between 1-step and multi-step adversarial\ntraining against sparse attacks.\n1\nIntroduction\nDeep neural networks have been shown vulnerable to adversarial perturbations [1]. To achieve\nrobust models, comprehensive evaluations [2–4] have demonstrated that adversarial training [5]\nand its variants [6–12] are the most effective methods. However, adversarial training is generally\ncomputationally expensive because generating adversarial perturbations in each training step needs\nmultiple forward and backward passes of the model. Such efficiency issues hinder the scalability\nof adversarial training to large models and large datasets.\nImproving the efficiency of adversarial training is tricky. Some works [13–16] employ faster but\nweaker 1-step attacks to generate adversarial perturbations for training. However, such methods\nmay suffer from catastrophic overfitting (CO) [17]: the model overfits these weak attacks instead\nof achieving true robustness against adaptive and stronger attacks.\nOn the other hand, most existing works [5, 18, 19] focus on studying adversarial perturbations\nbounded by l∞, l2 or l1 norms. In these scenarios, the set of allowable perturbations is convex,\nwhich facilitates optimizing adversarial perturbations and thus adversarial training. However, there\nare many scenarios in real-world applications where sparse perturbations, bounded by the l0 norm,\nneed to be considered [20–23]. Since the l0 norm is not a proper norm, the set of all allowable\nperturbations in this case is not convex. Consequently, from an optimization perspective, obtaining\nrobust models against sparse perturbations becomes more challenging. Compared with the l∞, l2\nand l1 counterparts, more steps are needed to generate strong l0 bounded perturbations, making\nthe corresponding adversarial training even more computationally expensive.\nAmong algorithms aiming at obtaining robust models against sparse perturbations, sAT and\nsTRADES [23] stand out as the most effective ones. These methods employ adversarial training\nagainst Sparse-PGD (sPGD) [23].\nHowever, they still require 20 steps to generate adversarial\nperturbations in each training step to achieve decent performance. As demonstrated in Table 1,\nnaively decreasing the number of steps to 1 leads to a significant performance decline for both sAT\nand sTRADES.\nIn this work, we investigate the challenges associated with fast adversarial training against\nsparse perturbations, including training instability caused by catastrophic overfitting (CO) and\n∗Correspondence author.\n1\narXiv:2502.21041v1  [cs.LG]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\nTable 1: Robust accuracy of sAT and sTRADES [23] with different steps (t). The evaluation is based on\nSparse-AutoAttack (sAA) [23], where the sparsity level is ϵ = 20. The models are PreactResNet-18 [24]\ntrained on CIFAR-10 [25].\nsAT (t = 1)\nsAT (t = 20)\nsTRADES (t = 1)\nsTRADES (t = 20)\nRobust Accuracy\n0.0\n36.2\n31.0\n61.7\nperformance decline in both robust and clean accuracy. Specifically, we highlight that CO in l0\nadversarial training is caused by sub-optimal perturbation locations of 1-step attack. Our obser-\nvation indicates that adjusting the perturbation magnitudes alone cannot help mitigate CO in\nthis context, so some existing CO mitigation methods [26–29] used in other cases do not work\nin the l0 scenario.\nAlthough the multi-ϵ strategy can mitigate sub-optimal perturbation loca-\ntions, it suffers from unstable training and degraded clean accuracy. In light of these findings,\nwe present empirical and theoretical evidence to illustrate that the loss landscape of adversarial\ntraining against l0 bounded perturbations is markedly more craggy compared to its l∞, l2, and\nl1 counterparts. Furthermore, we corroborate that the craggy loss landscape aggravates CO in l0\nadversarial training.\nDrawing from these insights, we propose to utilize soft labels and a trade-off loss function to\nenhance the smoothness of the adversarial loss objective function, thereby improving the perfor-\nmance of fast adversarial training against sparse perturbations. In addition to the performance,\nwe showcase that these techniques can eliminate CO, thus improving training stability. Finally,\nour extensive experiments demonstrate that smoothing the loss landscape can effectively narrow\nthe performance gap between 1-step adversarial training and its multi-step counterparts.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to investigate fast adversarial training in\nthe context of l0 bounded perturbations. We summarize the contributions of this paper as follows:\n1. We highlight that catastrophic overfitting (CO) in fast l0 adversarial training is caused by\nsub-optimal perturbation locations of 1-step attack. Popular techniques in fast l∞, l2 and l1\nadversarial training are ineffective in the l0 case. Although the multi-ϵ strategy can mitigate sub-\noptimal perturbation locations, it suffers from unstable training and degraded clean accuracy.\n2. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that the adversarial loss landscape is more craggy\nin the l0 cases than in other cases, which further aggravates CO in l0 adversarial training. In\nthis regard, we propose Fast-LS-l0 which incorporates labels and the trade-off loss function to\nprovably smooth the adversarial loss landscape.\n3. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that smoothing the adversarial loss landscape greatly\nnarrows the performance gap between 1-step l0 adversarial training and its multi-step coun-\nterpart.\nOur method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance for efficient adversarial\ntraining against sparse perturbations.\nNotation and Terminology Consider a classification model F(x, θ) = {fi(x, θ)}K−1\ni=0 , where\nx ∈Rd is the input, θ represents the parameters of the model, and K is the number of classes,\nfi(x, θ) is the logit of the i-th class. Correspondingly, we use {hi}K−1\ni=0\nto represent the output\nprobability of each class, which is the result of softmax function applied to {fi}K−1\ni=0 . Therefore,\nthe loss objective function L based on the cross-entropy is calculated as follows:\nL(x, θ)\ndef\n= −\nK−1\nX\ni=0\nyi log hi(x, θ)\ndef\n= −\nK−1\nX\ni=0\nyi log\nexp(fi(x, θ))\nPK−1\nj=0 exp(fj(x, θ))\n(1)\nwhere y = [y1, y2, ..., yC] is the label of x in a simplex, i.e., P\ni yi = 1. In the context of adversarial\nperturbation, we use S(p)\nϵ\n(x)\ndef\n= {δ|∥δ∥p ≤ϵ, 0 ≤x + δ ≤1} to represent the adversarial budget,\ni.e., the set of all allowable input perturbations for the input x. The adversarial loss function is\nL(p)\nϵ (x, θ)\ndef\n= maxδ∈S(p)\nϵ\n(x) L(x + δ, θ). Despite no guarantee to obtain the optimal perturbation in\npractice, to simplify the notation, we denote the term L(p)\nϵ\nalso as the adversarial loss induced by\nthe actual attack algorithms and omit the superscript (p) when there is no ambiguity.\n2\n\n\n2\nRelated Works\nAdversarial Attacks: The existence of adversarial examples is first identified in Szegedy et al.\n[1], which focuses on l2 norm-bounded adversarial perturbations.\nFast gradient sign method\n(FGSM) [30] introduces an efficient approach by generating perturbations bounded by its l∞norm\nin a single step. Furthermore, projected gradient descent (PGD) [5] extends and improves FGSM\n[31] by iterative updating and random initialization. In addition to these white-box attacks where\nthe attackers have full access to the models, there are also several black-box attacks [32, 33] where\nthe attackers’ access is restricted. AutoAttack (AA) [3] is an ensemble of both white-box and\nblack-box attacks to ensure a more reliable evaluation of model’s robustness.\nAdversarial Training: Adversarial training [5–12] has emerged as a popular and reliable\nframework to obtain robust models [2, 3]. Under this framework, we first generate adversarial\nexamples and update model parameters based on these examples in each mini-batch update. Dif-\nferent adversarial training variants, such as TRADES [34] and MART [35], may have different\nloss objective functions for generating adversarial examples and updating model parameters. Fur-\nthermore, compared with training on clean inputs, adversarial training is shown to suffer more\nfrom overfitting [36, 37]. In this regard, self-adaptive training (SAT) [38], which utilizes historical\npredictions as the soft label, has demonstrated its efficacy in improving the generalization.\nSparse Perturbations: Adversarial budget defined by l1 norm is the tightest convex hull of\nthe one defined by l0 norm. In this context, SLIDE [18] extends PGD and employs k-coordinate\nascent to generate l1 bounded perturbations. Similarly, AutoAttack-l1 (AA-l1) [39] extends AA\nto the l1 case. However, AA-l1 is found to generate non-sparse perturbations that SLIDE fails to\ndiscover [19], indicating that l1 bounded perturbations are not necessarily sparse. Therefore, we\nuse l0 norm to strictly enforce sparsity. It is challenging to optimize over an adversarial budget\ndefined by l0 norm, because of non-convex adversarial budgets. While naively applying PGD in\nthis case turns out sub-optimal, there are several black-box attacks, including CornerSearch [21]\nand Sparse-RS [22], and white-box attacks, including Sparse Adversarial and Interpretable Attack\nFramework (SAIF) [40] and Sparse-PGD (sPGD) [23], which address the optimization challenge of\nfinding l0 bounded perturbations. Ultimately, Sparse-AutoAttack (sAA) [23], combining the most\npotent white-box and black-box attacks, emerges as the most powerful sparse attack.\nFast Adversarial Training: While effective, adversarial training is time-consuming due to\nthe use of multi-step attacks. To reduce the computational overhead, some studies [13, 14] em-\nploy faster one-step attacks in adversarial training. However, the training based on these weaker\nattacks may suffer from catastrophic overfitting (CO) [17], where the model overfits to these weak\nattacks instead of achieving true robustness against a variety of attacks. CO is shown to arise\nfrom distorted decision boundary caused by sub-optimal perturbation magnitudes [26]. There are\nseveral methods proposed to mitigate CO, including aligning the gradients of clean and adversarial\nsamples [27], adding stronger noise to clean sample [41] , adaptive step size [29], regularizing ab-\nnormal adversarial samples [42], adding layer-wise weight perturbations [43], and penalizing logits\ndiscrepancy [44]. Furthermore, compared to its l2 and l∞counterparts, CO is caused by overfitting\nto sparse perturbations during l1 adversarial training [19]. To address this issue, Fast-EG-l1 [19]\nis introduced to generate l1 bounded perturbations by Euclidean geometry instead of coordinate\nascent. In this work, we investigate fast adversarial training against l0 bounded perturbations.\n3\nChallenges in Fast l0 Adversarial Training\nTo obtain robust models against sparse perturbations, preliminary efforts use 20-step sPGD in\nadversarial training, which introduces significant computational overhead. To accelerate training,\nwe explore using 1-step sPGD in adversarial training. However, as reported in Table 1, the models\nobtained in this way exhibit weak robustness against stronger and comprehensive sparse attacks\nsuch as sAA. In this section, we study the underlying factors that make fast l0 adversarial training\nchallenging by both numerical experiments and theoretical analyses.\n3.1\nCatastrophic Overfitting in Fast l0 Adversarial Training\nWe plot the learning curves of adversarial training using 1-step sPGD in Figure 1. Specifically, we\nadopt the multi-ϵ strategy [19, 23] and allow for different adversarial budget sizes, i.e., ϵ, during\ntraining and testing.\nThe results in Figure 1 indicate that CO happens in all configurations.\n3\n\n\nMoreover, our observations of CO in l0 cases are different from other cases in several aspects. First,\nrandom initialization of adversarial perturbation, proven effective in l∞, l2 and l1 cases, does not\nyield similar results in the l0 case. In addition, Figure 1 showcases that the training accuracy on\nthe inputs perturbed by 1-step sPGD is even higher than their clean counterparts. What’s more,\nwhen CO happens in l∞, l2 and l1 cases, the model sharply achieves perfect robustness against 1-\nstep attacks but zero robustness against multi-step attacks, both in few mini-batch updates. Such\nphenomenon is not observed in l0 cases. By contrast, we observe dramatic performance fluctuations\non clean examples throughout the training process, even in the fine-tuning phase. Such training\ninstability indicates a non-smooth landscape of the loss function in the parameter space: a subtle\nchange in parameters θ leads to abrupt fluctuation in the loss.\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nEpoch\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nAccuracy\nClean Acc.\nRobust Acc.\n(a) ϵtrain = 20\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nEpoch\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nAccuracy\nClean Acc.\nRobust Acc.\n(b) ϵtrain = 40\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nEpoch\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nAccuracy\nClean Acc.\nRobust Acc.\n(c) ϵtrain = 120\nFigure 1: The learning curves of adversarial training against 1-step sPGD [23] with random noise initial-\nization.

To ascertain if this applies to l0 adversarial training, we evaluate\nthe robustness accuracy of models trained by 1-step sAT with varying ϵtrain against interpolations\nbetween the clean inputs and the perturbed ones by 1-step sPGD. Table 2 shows that we cannot find\nsuccessful adversarial examples through such simple interpolations. In addition, the substantial l0\ndistance between 1-step sPGD and sAA perturbations (see in Appendix E.1) suggests that CO in l0\nadversarial training is primarily due to sub-optimal perturbation locations rather than magnitudes.\nConsequently, existing CO mitigation methods like GradAlign [27], ATTA [28], and adaptive step\nsize [29] turn out ineffective or insufficient for l0 scenarios. We defer the detailed evaluation to\nAppendix E.4.\nDespite that, we find that multi-ϵ strategy [23] mitigate the sub-optimality of perturbation\nlocation resulting from 1-step attacks to some extent. The detailed discussion is deferred to Ap-\npendix E.2. However, as illustrated in Figure 1, a larger ϵtrain, in turn, leads to unstable training\nand degraded clean accuracy. To address this challenge, we investigate the loss landscape in the\nsubsequent sections.\n3.2\nTheoretical Analyses on the Smoothness of Adversarial Loss Func-\ntions\nWe first provide theoretical analyses on the smoothness of adversarial loss function. Similar to\n[45], we assume the first-order smoothness of the model’s outputs {fi}K−1\ni=0 .\n4\n\n\nAssumption 3.1. (First-order Lipschitz condition) ∀i ∈{0, 1, ..., K −1}, the function fi\nsatisfies the following first-order Lipschitz conditions, with constants Lθ, Lx:\n∀x, θ1, θ2,\n∥fi(x, θ1) −fi(x, θ2)∥≤Lθ∥θ1 −θ2∥,\n(2)\n∀θ, x1, x2,\n∥fi(x1, θ) −fi(x2, θ)∥≤Lx∥x1 −x2∥.\n(3)\nWe then study the first-order smoothness of the adversarial loss objective function Lϵ(x, θ).\nLemma 3.2. (Lipschitz continuity of adversarial loss) If Assumption 3.1 holds, we have:\n∀x, θ1, θ2,\n∥Lϵ(x, θ1) −Lϵ(x, θ2)∥≤Aθ∥θ1 −θ2∥,\n(4)\nThe Lipschitz constant Aθ = 2 P\ni∈S+ yiLθ where S+ = {i | yi > 0, hi(x+δ1, θ2) > hi(x+δ1, θ1)},\nδ1 ∈arg maxδ∈SϵL(x + δ, θ) and δ2 ∈arg maxδ∈SϵL(x + δ, θ).\nThe proof is deferred to Appendix B.1, in which we can see the upper bound in Lemma 3.2\nis tight and can be achieved in the worst cases. Lemma 3.2 indicates that the adversarial loss\nLϵ(x, θ) is Lipschitz continuous, which is consistent with [45].\nTo study the second-order smoothness of Lϵ(x, θ), we start with the following assumption.\nAssumption 3.3. (Second-order Lipschitz condition) ∀i ∈{0, 1, ..., K −1}, the function fi\nsatisfies the following second-order Lipschitz conditions, with constants Lθθ, Lθx:\n∀x, θ1, θ2,\n∥∇θfi(x, θ1) −∇θfi(x, θ2)∥≤Lθθ∥θ1 −θ2∥,\n(5)\n∀θ, x1, x2,\n∥∇θfi(x1, θ) −∇θfi(x2, θ)∥≤Lθx∥x1 −x2∥.\n(6)\nLemma 3.4. (Lipschitz smoothness of adversarial loss) If Assumption 3.1 and 3.3 hold,\nwe have:\n∀x, θ1, θ2,\n∥∇θLϵ(x, θ1) −∇θLϵ(x, θ2)∥≤Aθθ∥θ1 −θ2∥+ Bθδ.\n(7)\nThe Lipschitz constant Aθθ = Lθθ and Bθδ = Lθx∥δ1 −δ2∥+ 4Lθ where δ1 ∈arg maxδ∈SϵL(x +\nδ, θ1) and δ2 ∈arg maxδ∈SϵL(x + δ, θ2).\nThe proof is deferred to Appendix B.2. Lemma 3.4 indicates the adversarial loss objective\nfunction Lϵ(x, θ) w.r.t. the model parameter θ is no longer smooth. That is to say, gradients in\narbitrarily small neighborhoods in the θ-space can change discontinuously. Furthermore, the degree\nof discontinuity is indicated by the value of Bθδ. Given the expression of Bθδ, we can conclude\nthat a larger ∥δ1 −δ2∥can intensify the gradient discontinuity. Additionally, as elucidated by\nTheorem 2 in [45], the gradients are non-vanishing in adversarial training. A large Bθδ introduces\nlarge gradient magnitudes asymptotically, making optimization challenging.\nHowever, in practice, we may use non-smooth activations, like ReLU, which do not strictly\nsatisfy Assumption 3.3. For example, the gradient of ReLU changes abruptly in the neighbor-\nhood around 0. In this regard, we provide a more detailed analysis of this case in Appendix C,\nwhich suggests that our analyses can be straightforwardly extended to networks with non-smooth\nactivations.\nWithout the loss of generality, the Lipschitz properties in Assumption 3.1 and 3.3 can be based\non any proper lp norm, i.e., p ∈[1, +∞], which, however, does not include l0 norm. Correspond-\ningly, ∥δ1 −δ2∥in the expression of Bθδ is based on the same norm as in the assumptions. On\nthe popular benchmark CIFAR-10, the commonly used values of ϵ in the l0, l1, l2 and l∞cases\nare 3601, 24, 0.5 and 8/255, respectively [5, 19, 23, 39]. In Appendix D, we discuss the numerical\nupper bound of ∥δ1 −δ2∥when the Lipschitz assumptions are based on different proper norms.\nThe results demonstrate that the upper bound of ∥δ1 −δ2∥in the l0 case is always significantly\nlarger than other cases, indicating a more craggy adversarial loss function in l0 adversarial train-\ning. Moreover, to corroborate the Lipschitz smoothness assumption in Inequality (6), we compare\nthe distances between the gradients induced by one-step and multi-step attacks with different\nadversarial budgets in Appendix E.3.\n1In Zhong et al.

Numerically, we employ the power method [45–47] to iteratively estimate the\neigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of Hessian matrices. We plot the top-10 eigenvalues\nof the Hessian matrices ∇2\nθLϵ(x, θ) under different ϵ in l0 cases in Figure 2 (a). In addition, we\ncompare the Hessian spectrum in the l0 case with l∞, l2 and l1 cases in Figure 2 (b). Our results\nin Figure 2 (a) demonstrate that eigenvalues of Hessian matrices in l0 cases increase as ϵ grows,\nindicating a higher degree of non-smoothness for a larger ϵ. Moreover, Figure 2 (b) indicates that\nthe adversarial loss landscape in the l0 case is more craggy than its l∞, l2 and l1 counterparts,\neven when we set ϵ = 1, i.e., perturbing only a single pixel. These observations corroborate that\nl0 adversarial training exhibits worse second-order smoothness than other cases.\nTo study the first-order smoothness, we visualize the loss landscape of different settings in\nFigures 2 (c)-(f), which demonstrate that the loss in the l0 case abruptly increases even with\nsubtle changes in the model parameters.\nThis further suggests the non-smooth nature of the\nl0 adversarial loss landscape. More loss landscape visualizations of l0 adversarial training with\ndifferent ϵ are provided in Appendix E.8. The observations are consistent with that in Figure 2.\nAccordingly, we confirm that the loss landscape of l0 adversarial loss function is more craggy than\nother cases from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. In addition, among the cases studied\nin Figure 3, the l0 cases are the only ones suffering from CO, while the l∞, l2 and l1 cases do not.\nThis indicates that the craggy loss landscape aggravates CO.\nOn the other side, we show in Figure 3 that successful attempts to obtain robust models\nagainst l0 bounded perturbation also include elements that help improve the smoothness of the loss\nlandscape. 20-step sAT in Zhong et al. [23] uses an early stopping (ES) strategy to avoid CO and to\n6\n\n\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nEpoch t\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n||\nt\n||2\n1e6\n20-step sAT\n20-step sAT w/o ES\n(a) Gradient Norm\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nEpoch t\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nTest robust accuracy (%)\n20-step sAT\n20-step sAT w/o ES\n(b) Test Robust Accuracy\nFigure 3:\nRelationship between craggy loss landscape and CO.

The results\nare obtained from PreactResNet-18 trained on CIFAR-10, where ϵtrain = 40. Note that since the training\nof 20-step sAT w/o ES diverges under ϵtrain = 120, the results are presented under ϵtrain = 40 instead.\nachieve competitive performance. Specifically, ES interrupts the attack iteration once the current\nperturbed input is misclassified. ES is shown to circumvent the potential for excessive gradient\nmagnitude while maintaining the efficacy of the generated perturbations. Figure 3 compares the\ncases with and without ES in terms of gradient norm and robust accuracy on the test set by\nsAA. We can observe from Figure 3 that 20-step sAT without ES still suffer from CO and the\ncorresponding gradient magnitude during training indicates a craggy loss landscape. This finding\nfurther highlights a strong correlation between CO and the craggy nature of the loss landscape in\nl0 adversarial training.\nIn summary, our results suggest that the l0 adversarial training exhibits a more craggy loss\nlandscape than other cases, which shows a strong correlation with CO. Additionally, despite the\nnon-trivial performance of 20-step sAT with ES, its performance still exhibits considerable fluc-\ntuation and can be further improved, underscoring the need for a smoother loss function. In the\nnext section, we will propose our method to address the CO issue in fast l0 adversarial training.\n4\nSoft Label and Trade-off Loss Smooth Adversarial Loss\nNotice that Aθ in Lemma 3.2 can be regarded as a function of the label y. Thus, we first study\nhow different y affects the properties of the adversarial loss objective function Lϵ(x, θ).\nLet\nyh ∈{0, 1}K and ys ∈(0, 1)K denote the hard and soft label, respectively. That is to say, yh is a\none-hot vector, while ys is a dense vector in a simplex. Then, we have the following theorem:\nTheorem 4.1. (Soft label improves Lipschitz continuity) Based on Lemma 3.2, given a hard\nlabel vector yh ∈{0, 1}K and a soft label vector ys ∈(0, 1)K, we have Aθ(ys) ≤Aθ(yh).\nThe proof is deferred to Appendix B.3. Theorem 4.1 indicates that soft labels lead to a reduced\nfirst-order Lipschitz constant, thereby enhancing the Lipschitz continuity of the adversarial loss\nfunction. However, as indicated by Lemma 3.4, the second-order Lipschitz constant remains unaf-\nfected by variations in y. Considering the poor performance on clean inputs when CO happens,\nwe introduce a trade-off loss objective function Lϵ,α which interpolates between the loss on the\nclean inputs and that on the adversarial inputs.\nLϵ,α(x, θ) = (1 −α)L(x, θ) + α max\nδ∈Sϵ(x) L(x + δ, θ)\n(8)\nwhere α ∈[0, 1] is the interpolation factor. Then, we have the following theorem:\nTheorem 4.2. (Trade-off loss function improves Lipschitz smoothness) If Assumption\n3.1 and 3.3 hold, we have:\n∥∇θLϵ,α(x, θ1) −∇θLϵ,α(x, θ2)∥≤Aθθ∥θ1 −θ2∥+ B′\nθδ\n(9)\nThe Lipschitz constant Aθθ = Lθθ and B′\nθδ = αLθx∥δ1−δ2∥+2(1+α)Lθ where δ1 ∈arg maxδ∈Sϵ(x)L(x+\nδ, θ1) and δ2 ∈arg maxδ∈Sϵ(x)L(x + δ, θ2).\n7\n\n\nThe proof is deferred to Appendix B.4. According to Theorem 4.2, the trade-off loss function\nLϵ,α enhances the second-order smoothness of adversarial loss objective function. The interpolation\nfactor α controls the balance between the loss on the clean inputs and the loss on the adversarial\ninputs. On one hand, a smaller value of α results in a smoother loss objective function, but it\nassigns less weight to the loss of the adversarial inputs and potentially hurts the robustness of the\nobtained model. On the other hand, a bigger value of α assigns more weight to the adversarial loss\nto focus on robustness, but it makes the corresponding adversarial loss objective function more\nchallenging for optimization. Furthermore, compared with l1, l2 and l∞cases, the trade-off loss\nfunction is particularly useful and necessary in the l0 case. This is supported by the analyses\nin Section 3.2 and Appendix D, which demonstrate that ∥δ1 −δ2∥is much larger in l0 bounded\nperturbations than other cases. Therefore, we expect the trade-off loss function Lϵ,α can help\nmitigate CO by improving smoothness.\nSimilar to Lemma 3.4, Theorem 4.2 can be straightforwardly extended to the networks with\nnon-smooth activations, where Assumption 3.3 is not strictly satisfied. We provide a more detailed\nanalysis in Appendix C to demonstrate the generality of our conclusions.\nIn summary, soft labels and the trade-off loss function can improve the first-order and second-\norder smoothness, respectively. Therefore, we can stabilize and improve the performance of fast\nadversarial training against l0 bounded perturbations by combining both techniques together.\nAmong various approaches available, we mainly exploit trade-off loss function, self-adaptive\ntraining (SAT) [38] and TRADES [34]. Specifically, SAT utilizes the moving average of previous\npredictions as the soft label to calculate the loss. TRADES combines the soft label and the trade-\noff loss function. It utilizes the trade-off loss function to balance the clean and robust accuracy\nand employs the prediction on the clean inputs as the soft label when calculating the loss for\nadversarial inputs. In Appendix A, we provide the pseudo-codes of both SAT and TRADES and\nthe formulation of their combination as a reference.\n5\nExperiments\nIn this section, we perform extensive experiments to investigate various approaches that can sta-\nbilize and improve the performance of fast adversarial training against l0 bounded perturbations.\nFurthermore, we compare the performance of 1-step adversarial training with the multi-step coun-\nterpart on different datasets. Our results demonstrate that approaches combining soft labels and\ntrade-off loss function significantly enhance the stability and efficacy of 1-step adversarial training,\neven surpassing some baselines of multi-step adversarial training. Finally, we validate the efficacy\nof our method on different networks in Appendix E.7, visualize the loss landscape when using soft\nlabel and trade-off loss function in Appendix E.9 to demonstrate its improved smoothness, and\nconduct ablation studies for analysis in Appendix E.10.\n5.1\nApproaches to Improving 1-Step l0 Adversarial Training\nTable 3: Comparison of different approaches and their combinations in robust accuracy (%) by sAA. The\ntarget sparsity level ϵ = 20. We compare PreAct ResNet-18 [24] models trained on CIFAR-10 [25] with\n100 epochs.

Additionally,\nwe explore the data augmentation technique N-FGSM [41], known for its ability to improve the\nperformance of fast adversarial training without imposing significant computational overhead. Our\nfindings, summarized in Table 3, are all based on 1-step adversarial training. The robust accuracy\nis measured using the sparse-AutoAttack (sAA) method, with ϵ set to 20.\nIn Table 3, we investigate the following approaches and their combinations: (1) sAT: adversar-\nial training against 1-step sPGD [23]. (2) Tradeoff: 1-step adversarial training with the trade-off\n8\n\n\nloss function defined in Eq. (8). (3) sTRADES: the 1-step sTRADES [23]. As discussed in\nAppendix A, it incorporates both soft label and trade-off loss function. We include two variants\nof sTRADES for comparison: sTRADES (T) is the training mode where we only use the loss\nobjective function of TRADES for training but still use the cross-entropy loss to generate adver-\nsarial examples; sTRADES (F) is the full mode where we use the KL divergence loss function for\ngenerating adversarial perturbations. Compared with 1-step sAT, sTRADES (T) introduces 25%\noverhead while sTRADES (F) introduces 50% overhead. (4) SAT: self-adaptive training [38]. As\ndiscussed in Appendix A, it introduces soft labels based on the moving average of the historical\npredictions and uses adaptive weights for training instances of different prediction confidence. (5)\nN-FGSM: data augmentation technique by adding random noise to the training data. It is proven\neffective in 1-step adversarial training [41] and may mitigate the sub-optimality of perturbation lo-\ncation by randomly perturbing more pixels. The implementation details are deferred to Appendix\nF.\nThe results in Table 3 indicate that using trade-off loss function alone still suffers from CO. In\ncontrast, using soft label, either by SAT or sTRADES, can eliminate CO and achieve notable robust\naccuracy. This suggests that the soft label has a more prominent role in mitigating overfitting\nthan the trade-off loss function in 1-step l0 adversarial training. Furthermore, sTRADES (F) alone\noutperforms sTRADES (T) along by a substantial margin of 24.4%, which can be attributed to the\ngeneration of higher-quality adversarial examples for training by sTRADES (F). Finally, both SAT\nand N-FGSM can enhance the performance of all approaches, demonstrating their effectiveness.\nIt is important to note that all the results presented in Table 3 are obtained using sAA, which is\nknown for generating the strongest attacks in terms of sparse perturbations. Our findings demon-\nstrate that incorporating soft labels and trade-off loss function yields substantial performance\nimprovements in 1-step l0 adversarial training. Among various combinations of methods explored,\nthe model trained with sTRADES (T) in combination with SAT and N-FGSM achieves the highest\nrobust accuracy against sAA, reaching an impressive 63.0%. This establishes a new state-of-the-\nart performance in the context of fast robust learning methods against l0 bounded perturbations.\nFor convenience, we name this combination (i.e., 1-step sTRADES + SAT + N-FGSM) Fast-Loss\nSmoothing-l0 (Fast-LS-l0) in the subsequent sections. Its pseudo-code is given in Algorithm 3 of\nAppendix A. Additionally, the comparison with more baselines that either mitigate CO or smooth\nthe loss function is undertaken in Appendix E.4. The results demonstrate that our method is the\nmost effective approach for fast l0 adversarial training.\n5.2\nComparison with Multi-Step Adversarial Training\nIn this section, we compare 1-step adversarial training with its multi-step counterpart. For multi-\nstep adversarial training, we follow the settings in [23] and use 20-step sPGD based on cross-entropy\nto generate adversarial perturbations in sAT and sTRADES. Similar to Table 3, we incorporate\nSAT and N-FGSM into multi-step adversarial training as well. For 1-step adversarial training, we\nfocus on the configurations with the best performance in Table 3, i.e., Fast-LS-l0.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on various datasets. The results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-\n100 [48] are demonstrated in Table 4. More results on CIFAR-100 [25] and GTSRB [49] are in Table\n7 and 8 of Appendix E.5, respectively. Following the settings in [23], and given the prohibitively\nhigh complexity involved, we exclude multi-step sTRADES from the evaluation on ImageNet-\n100. In addition to the performance under sAA, we report the robust accuracy of these models\nunder various black-box and white box attacks, including CornerSearch (CS) [21], Sparse-RS (RS)\n[22], SAIF [40] and two versions of sPGD [23].\nNote that, we do not include SparseFool [20]\nand PGD0 [21] for evaluation, because they only have trivial attack success rates on our models.\nMoreover, we report the clean accuracy and the total running time for reference. Finally, to more\ncomprehensively validate the effectiveness of our results, we report the standard deviation of the\nperformance in Table 9 of Appendix E.6.\nThe results in Table 4, 7 and 8 suggest that both soft labels and trade-off loss function, in-\ntroduced by SAT and TRADES, can improve the performance of both 1-step and multi-step\nadversarial training. In addition, N-FGSM, originally designed for one-step adversarial training,\nalso contributes to performance improvements in the multi-step scenario. Furthermore, these tech-\nniques can greatly narrow down the performance gaps between 1-step and multi-step adversarial\ntraining, making fast adversarial training more feasible and competitive in the context of sparse\nperturbations. With the assistance of SAT and N-FGSM, our Fast-LS-l0 can achieve a performance\n9\n\n\nTable 4: Robust accuracy (%) against sparse attacks.

Theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that the loss landscape of l0 adversarial\ntraining is more craggy than other cases, and the craggy loss landscape strongly correlates with\nCO. To address these issues, we propose Fast-LS-l0 that incorporates soft label and trade-off\nloss function to smooth the adversarial loss function.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method in mitigating CO and narrowing down the performance gap between\n1-step and multi-step l0 adversarial training. The models trained with our method exhibit state-\nof-the-art robustness against sparse attacks in the context of fast adversarial training.\n7\nFuture Work\nOur previous work [23] and this paper investigate the generation of l0 bounded adversarial per-\nturbations and the corresponding defending algorithm, respectively. Our future work will focus\non extending the algorithm we have proposed to generate structured sparse perturbations.\nIn addition to the sparsity constraint, the locations of perturbations are constrained to be within\nspecific regions, such as patches, columns, and any customized patterns, for structured sparse\n10\n\n\nperturbations.\nMoreover, I will explore other scenarios that raise concerns in the community of trustworthy\ndeep learning, e.g., Machine Unlearning [50] and Adversarial Machine Learning for Social\nGood [51].\nMachine unlearning aims to remove the effect of a small “forget set” of training\ndata on a pretrained machine learning model. Whereas, adversarial machine learning for social\ngood leverages adversarial attacks to enhance the transparency, privacy, fairness, and reliability of\nmachine learning systems.\nReferences\n[1] Christian Szegedy, Wojciech Zaremba, Ilya Sutskever, Joan Bruna, Dumitru Erhan, Ian\nGoodfellow, and Rob Fergus.\nIntriguing properties of neural networks.\narXiv preprint\narXiv:1312.6199, 2013.\n[2] Anish Athalye, Nicholas Carlini, and David A.

Based on the definition of δ1 and δ2, we have Lϵ(x, θ1) = L(x + δ1, θ1) and Lϵ(x, θ2) =\nL(x + δ2, θ2).

The\nderivation can be straightforwardly extended to (13) by replacing δ1 with δ2.\nBased on the formulation of L in (1), ∥Lϵ(x, θ1) −Lϵ(x, θ2)∥can be further derived as follows:\n∥Lϵ(x, θ1) −Lϵ(x, θ2)∥≤\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\nX\ni∈S+\nyi log hi(x + δ1, θ2)\nhi(x + δ1, θ1)\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\n=\nX\ni∈S+\nyi\n\f\f\f\f\flog\n1 + P\nj̸=i exp(fj(x + δ1, θ2) −fi(x + δ1, θ2))\n1 + P\nj̸=i exp(fj(x + δ1, θ1) −fi(x + δ1, θ1))\n\f\f\f\f\f\n(14)\nwhere S+ = {i | yi > 0, hi(x + δ1, θ2) > hi(x + δ1, θ1)}.

To simplify the notation,\nthe last equation is based on the definition that {hj}K−1\nj=0 is the result of softmax function applied to\n{fj}K−1\nj=0 , i.e., hj(x, θ) =\nexp(fj(x,θ))\nP\nk exp(fk(x,θ)). Therefore, we have PK−1\nj=0 hj(x, θ) = 1 and ∀j, hj(x, θ) >\n0.\nAccording to the triangle inequality, we have:\n∥∇θ1L(x + δ1, θ1) −∇θ2L(x + δ2, θ2)∥\n≤∥∇θ1L(x + δ1, θ1) −∇θ1L(x + δ2, θ1)∥+ ∥∇θ1L(x + δ2, θ1) −∇θ2L(x + δ2, θ2)∥\n(19)\nPlug (18) to the first term on the right hand side of (19), we obtain:\n∥∇θ1L(x + δ1, θ1) −∇θ1L(x + δ2, θ1)∥≤\nK−1\nX\ni=0\nyi ∥∇θ1fi(x + δ1, θ1) −∇θ1fi(x + δ2, θ1)∥\n+\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\nK−1\nX\nj=0\nhj(x + δ1, θ1)∇θfj(x + δ1, θ1) −\nK−1\nX\nj=0\nhj(x + δ2, θ1)∇θfj(x + δ2, θ1)\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\n(20)\n17\n\n\nThe first term can be bounded based on Assumption 3.1.

The first inequality is based on the triangle\ninequality. The second inequality and the third inequality can be achieved asymptotically when\nthe equality of first-order Lipschitz continuity in Assumption 3.1 is achieved and the following\ncondition is satisfied.\n∃k1 ∈arg maxiL(i)\nθ , hk1(x + δ1, θ1) →1, max\nj̸=k1 hj(x + δ1, θ1) →0\n∃k2 ∈arg maxiL(i)\nθ , hk2(x + δ2, θ1) →1, max\nj̸=k2 hj(x + δ2, θ1) →0\n(22)\nNote that k1 and k2 are not always the same, since there may exist more than one biggest first-order\nLipschitz constant.\nCombining (20) and (21) together, we obtain:\n∥∇θ1L(x + δ1, θ1) −∇θ1L(x + δ2, θ1)∥≤2Lθ + Lθx∥δ2 −δ1∥\n(23)\nSimilarly, we have:\n∥∇θ1L(x + δ2, θ1) −∇θ2L(x + δ2, θ2)∥≤2Lθ + Lθθ∥θ2 −θ1∥\n(24)\nCombing the two inequalities above, we have:\n∥∇θL(x + δ1, θ1) −∇θL(x + δ2, θ2)∥≤Aθθ∥θ1 −θ2∥+ Bθθ\n(25)\nwhere\nAθθ = Lθθ;\nBθθ = 4Lθ + Lθx∥δ1 −δ2∥\n(26)\nB.3\nProof of Theorem 4.1\nProof. For hard label yh ∈{0, 1}K, let that the j-th elements of yh be 1 and the rest be 0. By\nthe definition of Aθ in Lemma 3.2, we have\nAθ(yh) = 2Lθ.\n(27)\nIt is known that PK−1\ni=0 hi(x, θ) = 1, which means ∃j, hj(x + δ1, θ2) ≤hj(x + δ1, θ1). Then, for\nsoft label ys ∈(0, 1)K, we have |S+| < K where S+ = {i | yi > 0, hi(x + δ1, θ2) > hi(x + δ1, θ1)}.\nThus, it holds\nAθ(ys) = 2\nX\ni∈S+\ny(i)\ns Lθ ≤Aθ(yh).\n(28)\nThe equality can be achieved asymptotically if P\ni/∈S+ y(i)\ns\n→0.\n18\n\n\nB.4\nProof of Theorem 4.2\nProof. By the definition of Lϵ,α in (8), we have\n∥∇θ1Lϵ,α(x, θ1) −∇θ2Lϵ,α(x, θ2)∥\n≤(1 −α)∥∇θ1L(x, θ1) −∇θ1L(x, θ2)∥+ α∥∇θ1Lϵ(x, θ1) −∇θ1Lϵ(x, θ2)∥\n(29)\nAccording to (24) in the proof of Lemma 3.4, the first term of the right hand side of (29) can be\nderived as\n∥∇θ1L(x, θ1) −∇θ2L(x, θ2)∥≤Lθθ∥θ1 −θ2∥+ 2Lθ.\n(30)\nAccording to Lemma 3.4, the second term of the right hand side of (29) satisifies\n∥∇θ1Lϵ(x, θ1) −∇θ2Lϵ(x, θ2)∥≤Lθθ∥θ1 −θ2∥+ Lθx∥δ1 −δ2∥+ 4Lθ.\n(31)\nCombining (29), (30) and (31), we have\n∥∇θ1Lϵ,α(x, θ1) −∇θ2Lϵ,α(x, θ2)∥≤Aθθ∥θ1 −θ2∥+ B′\nθδ,\n(32)\nwhere Aθθ = Lθθ and B′\nθδ = αLθx∥δ1 −δ2∥+ 2(1 + α)Lθ.\nC\nTheoretical Analysis of ReLU Networks\nSimilar to [45], we first make the following assumptions for the functions {fi}K−1\ni=0\nrepresented by\na ReLU network.\nAssumption C.1. ∀i ∈{0, 1, ..., K −1}, the function fi satisfies the following conditions:\n∀x, θ1, θ2,\n∥fi(x, θ1) −fi(x, θ2)∥≤Lθ∥θ1 −θ2∥,\n(33)\n∀θ, x1, x2,\n∥fi(x1, θ) −fi(x2, θ)∥≤Lx∥x1 −x2∥,\n(34)\n∀x, θ1, θ2,\n∥∇θfi(x, θ1) −∇θfi(x, θ2)∥≤Lθθ∥θ1 −θ2∥+ Cθθ,\n(35)\n∀θ, x1, x2,\n∥∇θfi(x1, θ) −∇θfi(x2, θ)∥≤Lθx∥x1 −x2∥+ Cθx.\n(36)\nCompared to Assumption 3.1 and 3.3, we modify the the second-order smoothness assumptions\nby adding two constants Cθθ and Cθx, respectively. They denote the upper bound of the gradient\ndifference in the neighborhood at non-smooth point.\nThus, they quantify how drastically the\n(sub)gradients can change in a sufficiently small region in the parameter space.\nBased on Assumption C.1, we have the following corollary:\nCorollary C.2. If Assumption C.1 is satisfied, it holds\n∥Lϵ(x, θ1) −Lϵ(x, θ2)∥≤Aθ∥θ1 −θ2∥,\n(37)\n∥∇θLϵ(x, θ1) −∇θLϵ(x, θ2)∥≤Aθθ∥θ1 −θ2∥+ Bθδ + Cθθ + Cθx.\n(38)\nThe Lipschitz constant Aθ = 2 P\ni∈S+ yiLθ, Aθθ = Lθθ and Bθδ = Lθx∥δ1 −δ2∥+ 4Lθ where\nδ1 ∈arg maxδ∈SϵL(x + δ, θ1) and δ2 ∈arg maxδ∈SϵL(x + δ, θ2).\nThe proof is similar to that of Lemma 3.2 and 3.4. Corollary C.2 indicates a more craggy loss\nlandscape in the adversarial training of networks with non-smooth activations.\nAdditionally, the Theorem 4.2 can be easily extended to accommodate Assumption C.1.\nCorollary C.3. If Assumption C.1 holds, then we have\n∥∇θLϵ,α(x, θ1) −∇θLϵ,α(x, θ2)∥≤Aθθ∥θ1 −θ2∥+ B′\nθδ + Cθθ + Cθx.\n(39)\nThe Lipschitz constant Aθθ = Lθθ and B′\nθδ = αLθx∥δ1−δ2∥+2(1+α)Lθ where δ1 ∈arg maxδ∈SϵL(x+\nδ, θ1) and δ2 ∈arg maxδ∈SϵL(x + δ, θ2).\n19\n\n\nD\nDiscussion of the Upper Bound of ∥δ1 −δ2∥\nWe define the lp adversarial budget for the perturbation δ ∈Rd as S(p)\nϵ\n= {δ | ∥δ∥p ≤ϵ, 0 ≤\nx + δ ≤1}. Therefore, we have ∥δ1 −δ2∥p ≤2ϵ, and ∀i, 0 ≤|δ(i)\n1\n−δ(i)\n2 | ≤1 where δ(i)\n1\nand δ(i)\n2\nare the i-th element of δ1 and δ2, respectively. For convenience, we denote δ1 −δ2 as ∆δ and\nδ(i)\n1\n−δ(i)\n2\nas ∆δi in the following.\nAssume that ϵ ≪d for l0, l1 and l2 bounded perturbations, and ϵ ≪1 for the l∞bounded\nperturbation. Then, ∀q ≥1, we have\nl0 budget:\nX\ni\n|∆δi|q ≤2ϵ,\nl1 budget:\nX\ni\n|∆δi|q ≤D1 + (2ϵ −D1)q,\nl2 budget:\nX\ni\n|∆δi|q ≤D2 + (4ϵ2 −D2)\nq\n2 ,\nl∞budget:\nX\ni\n|∆δi|q ≤d × (2ϵ)q,\n(40)\nwhere D1 = ⌊2ϵ⌋and D2 = ⌊4ϵ2⌋. The derived upper bounds are tight because\n(1) l0 budget: The equality achieves when the location of non-zero elements in δ1 and δ2 has\nno overlap, and the magnitude of their non-zero elements reaches ±1.\n(2) l1 budget: Since 0 ≤|∆δi| ≤1, the equality achieves when there exists at most one ∆δk\nsuch that |∆δk| < 1 and ∀j ̸= k, |∆δj| = 1. The maximum number of ∆δj is ⌊2ϵ⌋. Then, according\nto ∥∆δ∥1 ≤2ϵ, we have |∆δk| = 2ϵ −1 × ⌊2ϵ⌋.\n(3) l2 budget: The derivation is similar to that of the l1 case.\n(4) l∞budget: The equality achieves when δ1 = −δ2.\nOn popular benchmark CIFAR-10, d = 32 × 32 × 3 = 3072, and the commonly used values of ϵ\nin the l0, l1, l2 and l∞cases are 360, 24, 0.5 and 8/255, respectively [5, 19, 23, 39]. Substitute these\ninto (40), we can easily get that ∀q ≥1, the upper bound of P\ni |∆δi|q is significantly larger in the\nl0 case than the other cases. For instance, (2ϵ −D1)q, (4ϵ2 −D2)\nq\n2 and (2ϵ)q reach their respective\nmaximum values when q = 1, since all of them are smaller than 1. Then, the upper bounds of\nP\ni |∆δi|1 in the l0, l1, l2 and l∞cases are 720, 24, 1 and 49152/255 ≈192.8, respectively.\nFurthermore, the lq norm of ∆δ is defined as follows:\n∥∆δ∥q =\n X\ni\n|∆δi|q\n! 1\nq\n.\n(41)\nSince the upper bound of P\ni |∆δi|q in the l0 case is larger than 1 for all q ≥1, we can also derive\nthat ∀q ≥1, the upper bound of ∥∆δ∥q is always significantly larger in the l0 case than the other\ncases.\nE\nMore Experimental Details\nE.1\nLocation Difference between Adversarial Examples Generated by\n1-step sPGD and sAA\nAs illustrated in Figure 4(a), the adversarial perturbations generated by one-step sPGD during\ntraining are almost completely different from those generated by sAA in location rather than\nmagnitude. Combining with the results in Table 2, we can demonstrate that CO in l0 adversarial\ntraining is primarily due to sub-optimal perturbation locations rather than magnitudes.\n20\n\n\n1.75\n1.80\n1.85\n1.90\n1.95\n2.00\n||\ntrain\nsAA||0 /\ntrain\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nProbability\ntrain = 20\ntrain = 80\ntrain = 120\n(a) Location difference\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n||\ntrain\ntest||0 /\ntest\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nProbability\ntrain = 20\ntrain = 80\ntrain = 120\n(b) Location overlapping\nFigure 4:\nVisualization of location difference and location overlapping.\n(a) The distribution of the\nnormalized l0 distance between training adversarial examples generated by 1-step sPGD and sAA.

The models trained on 20-step sAT with different training ϵ are evaluated.\nE.2\nMulti-ϵ Strategy Mitigating Sub-optimality of Perturbation Loca-\ntions\nAs illustrated in Figure 4(b), the perturbations generated by 1-step attack with larger ϵtrain overlap\nmore with those generated by sAA with a smaller and fixed ϵtest in terms of location. Further-\nmore,the multi-ϵ strategy has been shown to be particularly effective in l0 adversarial training [23].\nThese findings suggest that the sub-optimality of perturbation locations brought by 1-step attacks\ncan be mitigated to some extent by multi-ϵ strategy.\nE.3\nDistances between Gradients Induced by 1-step and Multi-step At-\ntacks\nTable 5: Average l2 distances between gradients induced by 1-step and multi-step attacks, represented\nby ∥∇θLϵ(x + δone) −∇θLϵ(x + δmulti)∥2. The gradients are calculated of the training set of CIFAR-10\n[25].\nThe l0, l1, l2 and l∞models are obtained by 1-step sAT [23], Fast-EG-l1 [19], 1-step PGD [36]\nand GradAlign [33], respectively. The 1-step and multi-step l0 attacks are 1-step and 10000-step sPGD\n[23], respectively. The 1-step and multi-step l1 attacks are 1-step Fast-EG-l1 and 100-step APGD [39],\nrespectively.The 1-step and multi-step attacks for other norms are 1-step PGD [5] and 100-step APGD [3],\nrespectively.\nModel\nl0 (ϵ = 1)\nl1 (ϵ = 24)\nl2 (ϵ = 0.5)\nl∞(ϵ = 8/255)\nl2 distance\n15.8\n9.1 × 10−4\n3.6 × 10−4\n6.7 × 10−4\nBased on the Lipschitz smoothness assumption in Inequality (6), the gradient difference arising\nfrom approximated adversarial perturbations is bounded by Lθx∥δ1 −δ2∥where δ1 is the pertur-\nbation generated by 1-step attack and δ2 is the optimal perturbation. Based on the same reason\nthat l0 norm is not a proper norm, ∥δ1 −δ2∥is significantly larger in l0 cases than l∞, l2 and l1\ncases, which makes 1-step adversarial training more challenging in l0 cases. To corroborate this, we\ncompare the distance between gradients induced by 1-step and multi-step attacks. As presented\nin Table 5, the average distance between gradients induced by 1-step and multi-step l0 attacks is\n5 orders of magnitude greater than those in the l1, l2 and l∞cases, even when a single pixel is\nperturbed. This finding indicates that the loss landscape of l0 adversarial training is significantly\nmore craggy than other cases in the input space.\nE.4\nComparison with Other Baselines\nIn this section, we undertake a more comprehensive comparison between our proposed Fast-LS-l0\nand other baselines (ATTA [28], GradAlign (GA) [27], Fast-BAT [52], N-AAER [42], N-LAP [43],\nlabel smoothing (LS) [53], NuAT [16], AdvLC [44], MART [35] and AWP [54]), which either claim\n21\n\n\nTable 6: Comparison with other baselines in robust accuracy (%) by sAA.

Note\nthat all baselines are tuned through a hyperparameter search.\nAs demonstrated in Table 6, our method achieves the strongest robustness against sAA. First,\nnaive LS turns out ineffective under the l0 setting. The performance of Fast-BAT, NuAT, Ad-\nvLC and MART is not as good as the method we use. Second, FLC Pool, N-AAER, N-LAP,\nATTA and GradAlign suffer from CO, since they incorporate neither soft labels nor trade-off loss\nfunction. Combining ATTA and GradAlign with SAT and N-FGSM, which introduces soft labels,\ncan effectively mitigate CO, but these settings still underperform our method by a large margin.\nFinally, although our method also benefits from AWP, AWP introduces additional computational\noverhead, thereby not being adopted in our method.\nE.5\nMore Results of Section 5.2\nTable 7: Robust accuracy (%) of various models on different attacks that generate l0 bounded perturba-\ntions, where the sparsity level ϵ = 10.

In contrast to the settings in [23], we resize the\nimages in GTSRB to 32 × 32 instead of 224 × 224 and retrain the models from scratch. The model\nare trained with ϵ = 72 and evaluated for robustness with ϵ = 12. It is important to note that\ndue to the smaller search space resulting from low-resolution images, the attack success rate of the\nblack-box Sparse-RS (RS) under this setting is significantly higher than that reported in [23].\nE.6\nStandard Deviation of Robust Accuracy against Sparse-AutoAttack\nof Table 4(a)\nTable 9: Average robust accuracy against sAA [23] obtained from three runs, where the sparsity level\nϵ = 20. The variances are shown in brackets. The configurations are the same as in Table 4(a).

We calculate these standard deviations by running the experi-\nments three times with different random seeds. The configurations are the same as in Table 4(a).\nIt can be observed that the fluctuation introduced by different random seeds does not outweigh\nthe performance gain from the evaluated approaches.\nE.7\nEvaluation on Different Networks\nTable 10: Robust accuracy (%) of various networks against sAA on CIFASR-10, where the sparsity level\nϵ = 20.\nThe networks are adversarially trained with different methods, including 1-step sAT, 1-step\nsTRADES and the proposed Fast-LS-l0.\nPRN-18\nConvNeXt-T\nSwin-T\n1-step sAT\n0.0\n0.8\n0.1\n1-step sTRADES\n31.0\n71.0\n43.2\nFast-LS-l0\n63.0\n78.6\n58.9\nDespite the effectiveness of our method on PreActResNet-18 (PRN-18) and ResNet-34, the\nperformance of our Fast-LS-l0 and its ablations on different networks remains unexplored.\nIn\nthis regard, we further evaluate our method on two popular architectures, i.e., ConvNeXt [55]\nand Swin Transformer [56]. Note that we adopt their tiny versions for CIFAR-10, which have a\nsimilar number of parameters as ResNet-18, and we follow the training settings of their CIFAR-10\nimplementations. The other experimental settings are the same as those described in Section 5.1.\nAs shown in Table 10, vanilla adversarial training results in CO on all networks, and our method\nproduces the best robust accuracy against sAA, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method\non different networks.\nNotably, ConvNeXt shows surprisingly strong robustness against sAA,\nsuggesting that advanced architecture design and dedicated hyperparameter tuning can provide\nadditional performance gains. However, as Transformers has struggled to perform well on small\ndatasets without pretraining [57], Swin Transformer also underperforms CNN-based networks in\nthis scenario.\nE.8\nLoss Landscape of one-step sAT with Different ϵ\nAs supplementary of Figure 2, we visualize the loss landscapes of 1-step sAT [23] with different ϵ,\nincluding 20, 40 and 120, in Figure 5. It can be observed that the l0 adversarial loss exhibits a\ndrastic increase in response to relatively minor alterations in the θ-space. Moreover, the degree of\nnon-smoothness increases in proportion to ϵ, which is consistent with the observation in Figure 2\n(a).\n23\n\n\n1\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n2\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n loss\n0\n20\n40\n60\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n(a) L(0)\nϵ\n, ϵ = 20\n1\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n2\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n loss\n0\n20\n40\n60\n20\n40\n60\n80\n(b) L(0)\nϵ\n, ϵ = 40\n1\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n2\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n loss\n0\n20\n40\n60\n20\n40\n60\n(c) L(0)\nϵ\n, ϵ = 120\nFigure 5: Loss landscape of 1-step sAT [23] with different ϵ values on the training set of CIFAR-10 [25].\nThe architecture of the model is PreactResNet-18.

(d) Loss landscape of 1-step sTRADES (F). (e) Loss landscape of\n1-step sTRADES (T) + SAT. (f) Loss landscape of 1-step sTRADES (F) + SAT.\nThe effectiveness of soft label and trade-off loss function in improving the performance of l0\nadversarial training is demonstrated in Section 5.1 and 5.2. Additionally, we visualize the curves\nof top-10 eigenvalues of Hessian matrices of the different methods discussed in Section 5.1 and\ntheir respective loss landscapes in Figure 6. Note that since N-FGSM results in a larger upper\nbound of ∥δ1 −δ2∥, it is not considered here to make a fair comparison.\nFigure 6 (a) shows\nthat sTRADES induces considerably smaller eigenvalues of Hessian matrices compared to sAT,\nwhile the difference between sTRADES (T) and sTRADES (F) is negligible. SAT, on the other\nhand, has only a marginal effect on the eigenvalues. However, as illustrated in Figure 6 (b)-(f),\nSAT plays a crucial role in smoothing the loss landscape, which relates to the change rate of loss,\n24\n\n\ni.e., the first-order smoothness. These observations align with the theoretical derivation presented\nin Section 4, indicating that soft label improves the first-order smoothness, while trade-off loss\nfunction contributes to the second-order smoothness.\nE.10\nAblation Studies\nIn this section, we conduct more ablation studies on the results in Section 5.1. Specifically, we\nfocus on the best configuration in Table 3: Fast-LS-l0 (T) (i.e., 1-step sTRADES (T) + SAT &\nN-FGSM). Unless specified, we adopt the same training settings as in Table 3.\nTable 11 presents a performance comparison of the model when SAT is enable in different\ntraining phases. We can see that the performance achieves the best when enabling SAT at the\n50-th epoch. This observation demonstrates that the best performance in 1-step sTRADES is\nachieved when SAT is enabled at the intermediate epoch where the learning rate is relatively low.\nIn Table 12, we compare the performance when using different labels, either the hard label\nfrom ground truth or the soft label by SAT, to generate adversarial perturbations for training.\nThe results indicate that using soft labels to generate adversarial perturbations results in slightly\nbetter performance compared to using hard ones.\nIn Table 13, we compare the performance when using different momentum factor in SAT.

The theory of generalized partial-slice monogenic functions is\nconsidered as a syhthesis of the classical Cliﬀord analysis and the theory\nof slice monogenic functions. In this paper, we investigate the Cauchy\nintegral formula and the Plemelj formula for generalized partial-slice\nmonogenic functions.

Introduction\nClassical Cliﬀord analysis is a mathematical ﬁeld that extends the concepts\nof complex analysis to higher-dimensional spaces through the use of Cliﬀord\nalgebras. It centers around the study of monogenic functions (null solutions\nto the Dirac operator), which has been fully developed in the last decades.\nMore details can be found, for instance, in [3,11,14,17,25].\nA signiﬁcant diﬀerence between classical Cliﬀord analysis and complex\nanalysis is that polynomials formulated with vectors in higher dimensions\nare no longer monogenic anymore due to the non-commutativity of multi-\nplication of Cliﬀord numbers. A consequence of this is that theory of series\nexpansion is not as simple as in complex analysis. In 2010, Colombo, Saba-\ndini, and Struppa [9] extended this concept to the broader context of Cliﬀord\nalgebras, introducing the notion of slice monogenic functions. These func-\ntions were initially deﬁned as those that are holomorphic on each slice within\nEuclidean space, serving as a localized deﬁnition for slice regular functions.\nMore importantly, polynomials given in terms of vectors are monogenic in\n\n\n2\nManjie Hu, Chao Ding, Yifei Shen and Jiani Wang\nthis context, and consequently, numerous ﬁndings pertaining to slice mono-\ngenic functions are formulated in terms of slices, including nicely formulated\nTaylor and Laurent series expansions. For instance, in [16], the authors estab-\nlish an identity principle for slice regular functions in slice topology domains,\ngeneralize slice function deﬁnitions to arbitrary H subsets. In [2], the au-\nthor constructed three second-order diﬀerential operators with slice regular\nfunctions in their kernels, conﬁrming that slice regular functions over H are\nharmonic in a sense. In [13], the authors present the construction of a regular\nand non-commutative Cauchy kernel for slice regular quaternionic functions,\nalong with its formula yielding a novel Cauchy formula. [8] introduces a new\nmonogenicity concept for Cliﬀord algebra-valued functions from Rn+1 to Rn,\ninspired by [19] and [20], and derives a corresponding Cauchy integral for-\nmula.\nIn 2013, Colombo et al. [12] presented a global diﬀerential operator G\nwith non-constant coeﬃcients, whose zero solutions exhibit a strong connec-\ntion to slice monogenic functions under suitable domain conditions. Conse-\nquently, a theoretical framework centered around the diﬀerential operator\nG has emerged, analogous to the important role of the Cauchy-Riemann\noperator in single-variable complex analysis. Subsequently, this global diﬀer-\nential operator for slice regularity has gained signiﬁcant research attention.\nFor example, [24] establish a framework of global diﬀerential equations for\nslice regular functions over real alternative algebras, reﬁning quaternionic\nand slice monogenic results and generalizing them. They introduce diﬀer-\nential operators ϑ and ¯ϑ extending ∂/∂x and ∂/∂xc to ΩD\\R, elucidating\ntheir expressions in quaternions, octonions, and Cliﬀord algebras, and the\nconnection to slice regularity.\nThe theory of slice monogenic functions also has deep motivations in\nquantum mechanics. Back to 1930s, Birkhoﬀand von Neumann showed that\nquantum mechanics can be formulated over the real, the complex, and the\nquaternionic numbers. However, the spectral theory of quaternion linear op-\nerators has not been eﬀectively developed for a long time. This is mainly\nbecause the understanding of the spectral concept of quaternion linear op-\nerators is not deep enough, resulting in the inability to eﬀectively construct\nquaternion spectral theory. In 2006 , using techniques based solely on slice\nhyperholomorphic functions, the precise notion of spectrum of a quaternionic\nlinear operator, also known as S-spectrum, was identiﬁed by F. Colombo and\nI. Sabadini. The proposal of this concept laid a solid foundation for the devel-\nopment of quaternion spectrum theory. Since then the literature in quater-\nnionic spectral theory has rapidly grown, and much work has contributed to\nthis topic, see e.g. [1,4–7,21,22].\nIn [27, 28], the authors introduce a novel class of functions and oper-\nators, notably incorporating classical monogenic functions and slice mono-\ngenic functions as two particular instances. The main goal of this article\nis to develop integral formulas and Teodorescu transform in theory of gen-\neralized partial-slice monogenic functions. This provides important tools to\n\n\nTeodorescu transform for generalized partial slice monogenic functions 3\nstudy some diﬀerential equations (such as Beltrami equations) and Dirichlet\nproblems related to partial-slice monogenic functions.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we comprehensively\nreview the fundamental principles of Cliﬀord algebras and delve into the\nbasic deﬁnitions of monogenic and slice monogenic functions. Section 3 is\ndevoted to an introduction to the operator notations and pivotal theorems\npertaining to Generalized slice monogenic functions, which are central to\nour investigation. Extensions for the newly deﬁned Teodorescu operator to\nvarious important theorems and corollaries are given in Section 4.\n2. Preliminaries\nIn this section, we review some deﬁnitions and notations in Cliﬀord algebras,\nas well as the theories of monogenic functions and slice monogenic functions.\nMore details can be found in [3,10,14,18].\n2.1. Cliﬀord algebras\nLet {e1, e2, · · · , en} be the standard orthonormal basis for the n-dimensional\nreal Euclidean space Rn. The real Cliﬀord algebra, denoted by Rn, is con-\nstructed from these basis elements with the relations eiej +ejei = −2δij, 1 ⩽\ni, j ⩽n, where δij is the Kronecker symbol. Consequently, any element\na ∈Rn can be expressed in the form a = P\nA aAeA, aA ∈R, where\neA = ej1ej2 · · · ejr, A = {j1, j2, · · · , jr} ⊆{1, 2, · · · , n} and 1 ⩽j1 < j2 <\n· · · < jr ⩽n, e∅= e0 = 1.\nFor each integer k = 0, 1, · · · , n, the real linear subspace of Rn, denoted\nby Rk\nn and referred to as k-vectors, is generated by the binomial coeﬃcient\n\u0000 n\nk\n\u0001\nelements of the form eA = ei1ei2 · · · eik, 1 ⩽i1 < i2 < · · · < ik ⩽n.\nIn particular, the element [a]0 = a∅is called the scalar part of a. Further,\nthe so-called paravectors, which is a crucial subset of Cliﬀord numbers Rn,\nare elements in R0\nn ⊕R1\nn. This subset is subsequently associated with Rn+1\nthrough the following mapping\nRn+1 −→R0\nn ⊕R1\nn,\n(x0, x1, · · · , xn) 7−→x = x0 + x =\nn\nX\ni=0\neixi.\nNow, we introduce some involutions in Rn as follows.\n• Cliﬀord conjugation: The Cliﬀord conjugation of a = P\nA aAeA ∈Rn is\ndeﬁned as\na =\nX\nA\naAeA,\nwhere ej1 · · · ejr = ej1 · · · ejr, ej = −ej, 1 ⩽j ⩽n, e0 = e0 = 1.\n\n\n4\nManjie Hu, Chao Ding, Yifei Shen and Jiani Wang\n• Cliﬀord reversion: The Cliﬀord reversion of a = P\nA aAeA ∈Rn is\ndeﬁned as\n˜a =\nX\nA\naAf\neA,\nwhere\n^\nej1 · · · ejr = ejr · · · ej1 and eab = ˜b˜a for a, b ∈Rn.\nThe norm of a ∈Rn is formally deﬁned as |a| = [aa]0 =\n\u0010P\nA |aA|2\u0011 1\n2 .\nIn particular, the norm of a nonzero paravector x is given by |x| = (x¯x)\n1\n2 ,\nand so its inverse is given by x−1 =\n¯x\n|x|2 .\n2.2. Monogenic and slice monogenic functions\nNow, we review some deﬁnitions and preliminaries in the theory of monogenic\nfunctions as well as those in the theory of slice monogenic functions. One can\nﬁnd more details in [3,10,14,18].\nDeﬁnition 2.1 (Monogenic functions). Let Ω⊂Rn+1 be a domain and f :\nΩ−→R be a real-valued diﬀerentiable function. A function f = P\nA eAfA is\nleft monogenic in Ωif it satisﬁes the generalized Cauchy-Riemann equation\nDf (x) = Pn\ni=0 ei ∂\n∂xi f(x) = 0, x ∈Ω, where D is called the generalized\nCauchy-Riemann operator. Since multiplications of Cliﬀord numbers are not\ncommutative in general, there is a similar deﬁnition for right monogenic.\nRemark. Comparing with the generalized Cauchy-Riemann operator, the op-\nerator ∂x = Pn\ni=1 ei ∂\n∂xi is known as the classical Dirac operator in Rn. In\nCliﬀord analysis, both the null-solutions of the generalized Cauchy-Riemann\noperator and those of the Dirac operator are known as monogenic functions.\nOne can observe that every non-real paravector in the space Rn+1 can\nbe expressed in the form of\nx = x0 +\nn\nX\ni=1\nxiei =: x0 + x = x0 + rω,\nwhere r = |x| =\n\u0000Pn\ni=1 x2\ni\n\u0001 1\n2 and ω = x\n|x|, which is uniquely speciﬁed with\nproperties similar to a classical imaginary unit. In other words,\nω ∈Sn−1 =\n\b\nx ∈Rn+1 : x2 = −1\n\t\n.\nWhen x is real, then r = 0 and for every ω ∈Sn−1 one can write x = x+ω·0.\nDeﬁnition 2.2 (Slice monogenic functions). Let Ω⊂Rn+1 be a domain and\na function f : Ω−→Rn is (left) slice monogenic if, for every direction\nω ∈Sn−1, the function fω restricted to the subset Ωω = Ω∩(R ⊕ωR) ⊆R2\nexhibits holomorphicity, meaning it possesses continuous partial derivatives\nand fulﬁlls the condition\n(∂x0 + ω∂r) fω (x0 + rω) = 0\nfor all points x0 + rω ∈Ωω.\n\n\nTeodorescu transform for generalized partial slice monogenic functions 5\nThere is also an alternative approach to deﬁne slice monogenic functions\ngiven by Ghiloni and Perotti [23] in 2011 with the concept of stem functions.\nMany works in the theory of slice monogenic functions have been done with\nthis approach, for instance, [15,24,26]. We will review this in a more general\nsetting in the following section.\n3. Generalized partial-slice monogenic functions\nIn [27,28], the authors generalized slice monogenic functions to the so-called\ngeneralized partial-slice monogenic functions. In particular, they pointed out\nthat the theory of generalized partial-slice monogenic functions is a synthesis\nof classical Cliﬀord analysis and the theory of slice monogenic functions. Here,\nwe review some deﬁnitions and properties needed for the rest of this article.\nFor more systematic details, we refer the reader to [27,28].\nLet p and q be non-negative and positive integers, respectively. We con-\nsider functions f : Ω−→Rp+q, where Ω⊂Rp+q+1 is a domain. An element\nx ∈Rp+q+1 = Rp+1 ⊕Rq, can be identiﬁed with a paravector in Rp+q in the\nfollowing manner\nx = xp + xq ∈Rp+1 ⊕Rq, xp =\np\nX\ni=0\nxiei, xq =\np+q\nX\ni=p+1\nxiei.\nIn this context, we deﬁne the generalized Cauchy-Riemann operator and the\nEuler operator as\nDx =\np+q\nX\ni=0\nei∂xi =\np\nX\ni=0\nei∂xi +\np+q\nX\ni=p+1\nei∂xi =: Dxp + Dxq,\nEx =\np+q\nX\ni=0\nxi∂xi =\np\nX\ni=0\nxi∂xi +\np+q\nX\ni=p+1\nxi∂xi =: Exp + Exq.\nNote that in these deﬁnitions, we have utilized the notation Dxp and Dxq\nto represent the operators acting on the components xp and xq respectively,\nand similarly for the Euler operators.\nWe use S to represent the unit sphere in Rq, where its elements is de-\nnoted by xq = Pp+q\ni=p+1 xiei, fulﬁlling the condition\nS =\n\b\nxq : xq\n2 = −1\n\t\n=\n\n\nxq =\np+q\nX\ni=p+1\nxiei :\np+q\nX\ni=p+1\nxi2 = 1\n\n\n.\nIt is noteworthy that for any non-zero xq, there exists a unique positive real\nnumber r ∈R+ and a unique unit vector ω ∈S, which represents the direction\nof xq, such that xq = rω, where\nr =\n\f\fxq\n\f\f , ω = xq\n\f\fxq\n\f\f.\n\n\n6\nManjie Hu, Chao Ding, Yifei Shen and Jiani Wang\nIf xq = 0, we set r = 0, and ω is not uniquely determined, in other words,\nxq = 0 = xp + ω · 0 for arbitrary ω ∈S.\nFor an open set Ω⊂Rp+q+1, we introduce the notation\nΩω := Ω∩\n\u0000Rp+1 ⊕ωR\n\u0001\n⊆Rp+2,\nwhich deﬁnes a subset of Rp+2 by intersecting Ωwith the subspace spanned\nby Rp+1 and the line through the origin determined by ω. In order to develop\na theory of generalized partial-slice monogenic functions, we also need some\nrestrictions on the domains considered.\nDeﬁnition 3.1. Let Ωbe a domain in Rp+q+1, and Ωis called partially sym-\nmetric with respect to Rp+1 (or p-symmetric for short) if, for xp ∈Rp+1,\nr ∈R+, and ω ∈S,\nx = xp + rω ∈Ω=⇒[x] := xp + rS = {xp + rω, ω ∈S} ⊆Ω.\nNow, we review the approach to study the theory of generalized partial-\nslice functions with the concept of stem functions as follows.\nDeﬁnition 3.2. A function F : D −→Rp+q ⊗R C in an open set D ⊆Rp+2,\nwhich is invariant under the reﬂection of the (p + 2)-th variable, is called\na stem function provided its Rp+q-valued components, F1 and F2, where\nF = F1 + iF2, fulﬁll the conditions\nF1 (xp, −r) = F1 (xp, r) ,\nF2 (xp, −r) = −F2 (xp, r) ,\n(xp, r) ∈D. (3.1)\nEach stem function F induces a (left) generalized partial-slice function f =\nI(F) from ΩD to Rp+q, deﬁned as\nf (x) := F1 (x′) + ωF2 (x′) ,\nx′ = (xp, r) , x = xp + rω ∈Rp+q+1, ω ∈S.\nDeﬁnition 3.3. Let D ⊆Rp+2 be a domain, which is invariant under the\nreﬂection of the (p + 2)-th variable. The p-symmetric completion ΩD ⊂Rp+q\nof D is deﬁned by\nΩD =\n[\nω∈S\n\b\nxp + rω : ∃xp ∈Rp+1, r ≥0, (xp, r) ∈D\n\t\n.\nNote that a domain Ω⊂Rp+q+1 is p-symmetric if and only if there\nexists a domain D ⊂Rp+2 such that Ω= ΩD. In the rest of the article, we\nuse ΩD to stand for a p-symmetric domain in Rp+q+1.\nNow, we denote the set of all induced generalized partial-slice functions\non ΩD by\nGS (ΩD) := {f = I (F) : F is a stem function on D} .\nDeﬁnition 3.4. Let f ∈GS(ΩD). The function f is called generalized partial-\nslice monogenic of type (p, q) if its stem function F = F1 + iF2 satisﬁes the\nfollowing generalized Cauchy-Riemann equations\n(\nDxpF1 −∂rF2 = 0,\nDxpF2 −∂rF1 = 0.\n\n\nTeodorescu transform for generalized partial slice monogenic functions 7\nSimilar as the case of slice functions, there is also a representation for-\nmula for generalized partial-slice functions of type (p, q) as follows.\nTheorem 3.5 (Representation Formula). [27] Let f ∈GS (ΩD). Then it holds\nthat, for every x = xp + rω ∈ΩD with ω ∈S,\nf (x) = (ω −ω2) (ω1 −ω2)−1 f (xp + rω1)\n−(ω −ω1) (ω1 −ω2)−1 f (xp + rω2) ,\n(3.2)\nfor all ω1 ̸= ω2 ∈S. In particular, if ω1 = −ω2 = η ∈S, we have\nf (x) = 1\n2\n\u00001 −ωη\n\u0001\nf\n\u0000xp + rη\n\u0001\n+ 1\n2\n\u00001 + ωη\n\u0001\nf\n\u0000xp −rη\n\u0001\n= 1\n2\n\u0000f\n\u0000xp + rη\n\u0001\n+ f\n\u0000xp −rη\n\u0001\u0001\n+ 1\n2ωη\n\u0000f\n\u0000xp −rη\n\u0001\n−f\n\u0000xp + rη\n\u0001\u0001\n.\nRecall that the Cauchy kernel to monogenic functions over Rp+2 is given\nby\nE (x) =\n1\nσp+1\nx\n|x|p+2 , x ∈Rp+2 \\ {0},\nwhere σp+1 = 2\nΓp+2( 1\n2)\nΓ( p+2\n2 ) is the surface area of the unit sphere in Rp+2. With\nthe representation formula for generalized partial-slice monogenic functions\ngiven in Theorem 3.5, it is natural to deﬁne the generalized partial-slice\nCauchy kernel as follows.\nDeﬁnition 3.6. Given y ∈Rp+q+1, we call the function Ey (·) left generalized\npartial-slice Cauchy kernel deﬁned by\nEy (x) = 1\n2\n\u00001 −ωη\n\u0001\nEy\n\u0000xp + rη\n\u0001\n+ 1\n2\n\u00001 + ωη\n\u0001\nEy\n\u0000xp −rη\n\u0001\n,\n(3.3)\nwhere ω, η are deﬁned as in Theorem 3.5.\nWith the Cauchy-Pompeiu formula in the theory of monogenic functions\nand the representation formula given in Theorem 3.5, a Cauchy-Pompeiu for-\nmula in the context of partial-slice monogenic functions has been discovered\nin [27] for the case when x ∈U. There is also a Cauchy integral formula for\nthe case when x ∈Rp+q+1\\U, which is stated as follows.\nTheorem 3.7 (Cauchy integral formula for the exterior domain). Let Γ denote\na Jordan surface, partitioning the space into an exterior domain denoted as\nUη\n−and an interior domain Uη\n+, for some ﬁxed η ∈S. The orientation\nof Γ is chosen such that its normal vector points towards Uη\n−. Consider the\nfunction f that is left generalized partial-slice monogenic in Uη\n−, continuously\ndiﬀerentiable in Uη\n−∪Γ, and possesses a limit value f(∞) at x = ∞. Then,\nthe following equation holds\nZ\nΓ\nEy (x) n (y) f (y)dSη (y) =\n(\n−f (x) + f (∞)\n, x ∈Uη\n−,\nf (∞)\n, x ∈Uη\n+,\n\n\n8\nManjie Hu, Chao Ding, Yifei Shen and Jiani Wang\nwhere n(y) = Pp\ni=0 ni(y)ei + np+1(y)η represents the unit exterior normal\nvector to ∂Uη at y.\nProof. We choose a sphere Γρ = {x : |x| = ρ} with suﬃciently large radius ρ\nwhich contains Γ and Uη\n+, and consider the domain Uηρ := Uη\n−∩{|x| < ρ}.\nIts boundary is ∂Uηρ := Γρ ∪(−Γ) taking into account the orientation of Γ.\nThen the Cauchy integral formula for x ∈Uηρ yields\nf (x) = −\nZ\nΓ\nEy (x) n (y) f (y) dSη (y) + f (∞)\nZ\n|y|=ρ\nEy (x) n (y) dSη (y)\n+\nZ\n|y|=ρ\nEy (x) n (y) (f (y) −f (∞)) dSη (y)\n= −\nZ\nΓ\nEy (x) n (y) f (y) dSη (y) + f (∞) + R,\nR :=\nZ\n|y|=ρ\nEy (x) n (y) (f (y) −f (∞)) dSη (y).\nFrom our assumption the inequality |f (y) −f (∞)| < ε follows for suﬃciently\nlarge ρ. If we assume moreover ρ > 2 |x| we get\n|Ey (x)| =\n1\nσp+1\n1\n|y −x|p+1 ⩽\n1\nσp+1\n2p+1\nρp+1 ,\nbecause of |y −x| ⩾|y| −|x| > ρ\n2. Then, we have\n|Ey (x)| =\n\f\f\f\f\n1\n2\n\u00001 −ωη\n\u0001\nEy\n\u0000xp + rη\n\u0001\n+ 1\n2\n\u00001 + ωη\n\u0001\nEy\n\u0000xp −rη\n\u0001\f\f\f\f\n⩽1\n2\n\f\f\u00001 −ωη\n\u0001\nEy\n\u0000xp + rη\n\u0001\f\f + 1\n2\n\f\f\u00001 + ωη\n\u0001\nEy\n\u0000xp −rη\n\u0001\f\f\n⩽1\n2\n\f\f1 −ωη\n\f\f\n1\nσp+1\n2p+1\nρp+1 + 1\n2\n\f\f1 + ωη\n\f\f\n1\nσp+1\n2p+1\nρp+1 ⩽\n2\nσp+1\n2p+1\nρp+1 .\nHence, we can obtain that\n|R| ⩽\nZ\n|y|=ρ\n|Ey (x)| |n (y)| |f (y) −f (∞)| dSη (y)\n⩽ε · 2p+2\nσp+1\nZ\n|t|=1\ndst = ε · 2p+2.\nFor ρ →∞the value ε can be chosen arbitrarily small, and the claim for\nx ∈Uη\n−is proved.\nOur proof is also valid in the inner domain Uη\n+ as then the right-hand\nside contains the value 0 instead of f (x) in the formulas above.\n□\nThe integral\nZ\nΓ\nEy (x) n (y) f (y)dSη (y)\n\n\nTeodorescu transform for generalized partial slice monogenic functions 9\nin the previous theorem is the Cauchy-type integral in the context of general-\nized partial-slice monogenic functions. The boundary behavior of this integral\nis described by a Plemelj-Sokhotski formula given below.\nTheorem 3.8 (Plemelj-Sokhotski formula). Let the function f = I (F) ∈\nGS (ΩD) with its stem function F being H¨older continuous. Suppose U is a\np-symmetric domain in Rp+q+1 such that Uη ⊂Ωη for some η ∈S. Then, at\nany regular point x ∈∂Uη, we have\nn.t. lim\nt→x\nZ\n∂Uη\nEy (t) n (y) f (y) dSη (y)\n=1\n2\n\"\n±f (x) + 2\nZ\n∂Uη\nEy (x) n (y) f (y) dSη (y)\n#\n,\nwhere the limit is taken non-tangentially (denoted as n.t. lim) with t ∈Uη\n±,\nU +\nη = Uη, and U −\nη = Ωη\\Uη. The unit exterior normal vector to ∂Uη at y is\ngiven by\nn (y) =\np\nX\ni=0\nni (y) ei + np+1 (y) η.\nProof. Let t = tp + r′ω ∈Uη\n±, x = xp + rω ∈∂Uη, x′ = (xp, r) ∈D and\nη ∈S. Let\nf (x) = F1 (x′) + ωF2 (x′) ,\nwhere the stem function F = F1+iF2 is H¨older continuous. Indeed, According\nto the Splitting Lemma in [27], there exist H¨older continuous functions F j\nA :\nD −→Rp+1 (j = 1, 2) such that\nFj =\nX\nA={i1,··· ,is}⊂{p+2,··· ,p+q}\nF j\nAeA, j = 1, 2.\nwhere eA = ei1 · · · eis, A = {i1, · · · , is} ⊂{p + 2, · · · , p + q} with i1 < · · · <\nis, and I∅= 1 when A = ∅.\nThe Plemelj-Sokhotski formula for H¨older continuous functions in [17]\ngives that\nn.t. lim\nt→x\nZ\n∂Uη\nEy\n\u0000tp + r′η\n\u0001\nn (y) F j\nA (y) dSη (y)\n= 1\n2\n\"\n±F j\nA\n\u0000xp + rη\n\u0001\n+ 2\nZ\n∂Uη\nEy\n\u0000xp + rη\n\u0001\nn (y) F j\nA (y) dSη (y)\n#\n,\nwhere the variable y = yp+˜rη ∈∂Uη should be interpreted as\n\u0000yp, ˜r\n\u0001\n∈Rp+2.\nHence, we have\nn.t. lim\nt→x\nZ\n∂Uη\nEy\n\u0000tp + r′η\n\u0001\nn (y) F (y) dSη (y)\n= 1\n2\n\"\n±F\n\u0000xp + rη\n\u0001\n+ 2\nZ\n∂Uη\nEy\n\u0000xp + rη\n\u0001\nn (y) F (y) dSη (y)\n#\n.\n\n\n10\nManjie Hu, Chao Ding, Yifei Shen and Jiani Wang\nSubstituting η for i in the stem function F within the aforementioned formula,\nwe obtain\nn.t. lim\nt→x\nZ\n∂Uη\nEy\n\u0000tp + r′η\n\u0001\nn (y) f (y) dSη (y)\n= 1\n2\n\"\n±f\n\u0000xp + rη\n\u0001\n+ 2\nZ\n∂Uη\nEy\n\u0000xp + rη\n\u0001\nn (y) f (y) dSη (y)\n#\n,\nin other words,\nf\n\u0000xp + rη\n\u0001\n= ± 2\n\u0014\nn.t. lim\nt→x\nZ\n∂Uη\nEy\n\u0000tp + r′η\n\u0001\nn (y) f (y) dSη (y)\n−\nZ\n∂Uη\nEy\n\u0000xp + rη\n\u0001\nn (y) f (y) dSη (y)\n\u0015\n.\nMoreover, the formula remains valid when the variable xp +rη is substituted\nwith xp −rη.

Norm estimates of the Teodorescu transform\nIn [27], a global non-constant coeﬃcients diﬀerential operator for C1 function\nf : Ω−→Rp+q is given by\n¯ϑf (x) = Dxpf (x) +\nxq\n\f\fxq\n\f\f2 Exqf (x) .\nThe diﬀerential operator necessitates a more cautious approach due to the\nsingularities it introduces for the\n\f\fxq\n\f\f2 term within the operator. Therefore,\nwe will adopt the notation Rp+q+1\n∗\n:= Rp+q+1\\Rp+1 for the remainder of this\narticle.\n\n\nTeodorescu transform for generalized partial slice monogenic functions 11\nThe Cauchy kernel for generalized partial-slice monogenic functions is\ndeﬁned as follows\nKy (x) =\nEy (x)\nσq−1|yq|q−1\nwhere σq−1 is the area of the (q −1) -sphere S.\nThe Cauchy-Pompeiu formula we mentioned earlier is only applicable\nto Ωη. However, by the approach applied in [15, Theorem 3.5, 3.6], we can\neasily derive the Cauchy-Pompeiu formula and the Cauchy integral formula\non the domain ΩD as follows.\nTheorem 4.1 (Cauchy-Pompeiu formula). Let ΩD ⊂Rp+q+1\n∗\nbe a bounded\ndomain as previously deﬁned, and generalized partial-slice function f ∈ker ¯ϑ.\nIf U is a domain in Rp+q+1 such that UD ⊂ΩD is a bounded domain in Rp+2\nwith smooth boundary ∂UD ⊂ΩD, then for any x ∈U, we have\nf (x) =\nZ\n∂UD\nKy (x) n (y) f (y) dS (y) −\nZ\nUD\nKy (x)\n\u0000¯ϑf\n\u0001\n(y) dσ (y),\nwhere n (y) is the unit exterior normal vector to ∂UD at y, dS and dσ stand\nfor the classical Lebesgue surface element and volume element in Rp+2, re-\nspectively.\nTheorem 4.2 (Cauchy integral formula). Let ΩD ⊂Rp+q+1\n∗\nbe a bounded\ndomain as previously deﬁned, and slice function f ∈ker ¯ϑ. Then, for any\nx ∈ΩD, we have Z\n∂ΩD\nKy (x) n (y) f (y) dσ (y) = f (x) ,\n(4.1)\nwhere n (y) represents the unit normal vector pointing outwards from the\nboundary ∂ΩD at each point y.\nIf we denote\nTΩDf (x) = −\nZ\nΩD\nKy (x) f (y) dσ (y),\nF∂ΩDf (x) =\nZ\n∂ΩD\nKy (x) n (y) f (y) dS (y),\nthen the equation in Cauchy-Pompeiu formula in Theorem 4.1 can be rewrit-\nten as\nF∂ΩDf (x) + TΩD\n\u0000¯ϑf\n\u0001\n(x) = f (x) ,\nfor x ∈ΩD. Here, TΩD is usually called the Teodorescu transform. In par-\nticular, for functions with compact support in ΩD, we get F∂ΩDf (x) = 0.\nHence, we have that\nTΩD\n\u0000¯ϑf\n\u0001\n(x) = f (x) ,\nwhich suggests that TΩD is a left inverse of ¯ϑ when acts on functions with\ncompact support. Now, we introduce the existence for TΩDf and a norm\nestimate for TΩD as follows.\n\n\n12\nManjie Hu, Chao Ding, Yifei Shen and Jiani Wang\nProposition 4.3. Suppose that ΩD ⊂Rp+q+1\n∗\nis a bounded p-symmetric do-\nmain and f ∈Lt (ΩD). Then,\n1. The integral TΩDf (x) exists everywhere in Rp+q+1\n∗\nwhen t > q;\n2. ¯ϑTΩDf = 0 in Rp+q+1\n∗\n\\ΩD;\n3. Further, when t > max{2p −1, 2q −1} and q > 1, we have\n∥TΩDf∥Lt ⩽C (t, q, ΩD) ∥f∥Lt .\nProof. In the proof below, we consistently use the letter C to represent vari-\nous ﬁnite constants. Firstly, we observe that\n|TΩDf (x)| =\n\f\f\f\f−\nZ\nΩD\nKy (x) f (y) dσ (y)\n\f\f\f\f\n⩽\nZ\nΩD\n|Ky (x) f (y)| dσ (y)\n⩽\n\u0012Z\nΩD\n|Ky (x)|s dσ (y)\n\u0013 1\ns\n∥f∥Lt ,\nwhere 1\ns + 1\nt = 1, s, t > 1.

Hence, we have\nZ\nS+\nZ\nΩη\n\f\fy −\n\u0000xp + ηr\n\u0001\f\f−s(p+1) · |yq|−(s−1)(q−1)dση (y) dS(η)\n\n\nTeodorescu transform for generalized partial slice monogenic functions 13\n⩽\nZ\nS+\nZ\nEη\n\f\fy −\n\u0000xp + ηr\n\u0001\f\f−s(p+1) · |yq|−(s−1)(q−1)dση (y) dS(η).\nWe can easily ﬁnd that all Eη are the same with η ∈S up to a rotation.\nHence, we only need to show that\nZ\nEη\n\f\fy −\n\u0000xp + ηr\n\u0001\f\f−s(p+1) · |yq|−(s−1)(q−1)dση (y)\n(4.3)\nis ﬁnite uniformly with respect to η. The singularities of the integral above\noccur in the following two cases.\n1. The singular point y = xp + ηr,\n2. Points x with xq = 0.\nLet B\n\u0000xp + ηr, ǫ0\n\u0001\n⊂Eη be a neighborhood of xp + ηr with a suﬃciently\nsmall ǫ0 and\nEǫ1 =\n\b\nup + ηv : r0 < u0, · · · , up < R, −ǫ1 < v < ǫ1\n\t\n.\nThe ﬁniteness of the integral (4.3) is equivalent the ﬁniteness of\nZ\nB(xp+ηr,ǫ0)∪Eǫ1\n\f\fy −\n\u0000xp + ηr\n\u0001\f\f−s(p+1) · |yq|−(s−1)(q−1)dση (y).\nOn the one hand, let y = sζ , ζ ∈S, then we have\nZ\nB(xp+ηr,ǫ0)\n\f\fy −\n\u0000xp + ηr\n\u0001\f\f−s(p+1) · |yq|−(s−1)(q−1)dση (y)\n⩽C (x, t, q, ΩD)\nZ ǫ0\n0\nZ\nS\nrp+1−s(p+1)dsdS (ζ) < ∞,\nwith t > q. On the other hand, recall that y = up +ηv ∈Eǫ1, then we obtain\nZ\nEǫ1\n\f\fy −\n\u0000xp + ηr\n\u0001\f\f−s(p+1) · |yq|−(s−1)(q−1)dση (y)\n⩽C (x, t, q, ΩD)\nZ R\nr0\n· · ·\nZ R\nr0\nZ ǫ1\n0\nv−(q−1)(s−1)du0 · · · dupdv < ∞.\nTherefore, we obtain T f(x) is ﬁnite for all x ∈ΩD, which can lead to the fact\nthat TΩDf (x) exists everywhere in Rp+q+1\n∗\n. Further, as TΩDf has no singular\npoints in Rp+q+1\n∗\n\\ΩD and ¯ϑEy (x) = 0 is trivial, it follows that ¯ϑTΩDf = 0\nin Rp+q+1\n∗\n\\ΩD.\nIt is worth pointing out that we can not obtain the third statement by\nthe estimate for |TΩDf(x)| obtained above, since the constant C depends on\nx. Here, we need a more subtle argument to deal with the singularities in\n(4.2).\nWe denote xη = xp + rη, and let r1 > 0 be suﬃciently large such that\nΩD ⊂B(x, r1) for all x ∈ΩD. Let y = xη + lγ = xp + rη + lγ with γ ∈S,\nBη(xη, r1) := B(xη, r1) ∩Cη. Then, we can see that |yq| = |r + l cos θ| =\n\n\n14\nManjie Hu, Chao Ding, Yifei Shen and Jiani Wang\n|r + l⟨η, γ⟩|, where θ = arccos⟨η, γ⟩is the angle between η and γ. Now, we\nhave\nZ\nS+\nZ\nΩη\n|y −xη|−s(p+1) · |yq|−(s−1)(q−1)dση (y) dS(η)\n≤\nZ\nS+\nZ\nBη(xη,r1)\n|y −xη|−s(p+1) · |yq|−(s−1)(q−1)dση (y) dS(η)\n≤\nZ\nS+\nZ\nS+\nZ r1\n0\nl−s(p+1)|r + l⟨η, γ⟩|−(s−1)(q−1)lp+1dldS(ω)dS(η)\n≤C\nZ r1\n0\nl(1−s)(p+1)|r −l|(1−s)(q−1)dl.\nTo estimate the Lt norm of TΩD, we only need to show that the Lt norm of\n(4.2) is ﬁnite. Recall that r = |xq|, and with the argument above, we calculate\nZ\nΩD\n\f\f\f\f\nZ r1\n0\nl(1−s)(p+1)|r −l|(1−s)(q−1)dl\n\f\f\f\f\nt\ndV (x)\n≤\nZ\nS+\nZ\nΩω\n\f\f\f\f\nZ r1\n0\nl(1−s)(p+1)|r −l|(1−s)(q−1)dl\n\f\f\f\f\nt\nrq−1dVω(x)dS(ω).\nLet a, b > 0 such that\nΩω ⊂{x =\np\nX\ni=0\neixi + rω ∈Rp+q+1 : −a < x1, . . . , xp < a, 0 < r < b}\nfor all ω ∈S. Therefore, the last integral above becomes\n≤\nZ\nS+\nZ a\n−a\n· · ·\nZ a\n−a\nZ b\n0\n\f\f\f\f\nZ r1\n0\nl(1−s)(p+1)|r −l|(1−s)(q−1)dl\n\f\f\f\f\nt\nrq−1\n· dx0 · · · dxpdrdS(ω)\n≤C\nZ b\n0\n\f\f\f\f\nZ r1\n0\nl(1−s)(p+1)|r −l|(1−s)(q−1)dl\n\f\f\f\f\nt\nrq−1dr,\n(4.4)\nwhere the last equation comes from the fact that r = |xq| and l are indepen-\ndent to x0, . . . , xp.

Plugging back to (4.4) to obtain\nZ\nΩD\n\f\f\f\f\nZ r1\n0\nl(1−s)(p+1)|r −l|(1−s)(q−1)dl\n\f\f\f\f\nt\ndV (x)\n≤C\nZ b\n0\n\f\f\f\fC(r1, t, p) + r2(1−s)(q−1)+1 + (r −r1)2(1−s)(q−1)+1\n2(1 −s)(q −1) + 1\n\f\f\f\f\nt\nrq−1dr\n≤C(r1, t, p) + C1(r1, t, p)\n\u0014 Z b\n0\nr2(1−s)(q−1)t+t+q−1dr\n+\nZ b\n0\n(r −r1)2(1−s)(q−1)t+trq−1dr\n\u0015\n,\nwhere the last integral is ﬁnite when 2(1 −s)(q −1)t + t > −1, which also\nimplies that 2(1 −s)(q −1)t + t + q −1 > −1. A straightforward calculation\nshows that this can be satisﬁed when t > max{2p −1, 2q −1} and q > 1,\nwhich completes the proof.\n□\nFurther, we claim that TΩalso maps slice functions to slice functions as\nfollows.\nProposition 4.4. Let ΩD ⊂Rp+q+1\n∗\nbe a bounded domain and t > q, then we\nhave that\nTΩD : Lt (ΩD) −→Lt (ΩD)\nis continuous.\nProof. It is easy to know that TΩD maps Lt (ΩD) to Lt (ΩD) can be ob-\ntained immediately from Proposition 4.3. Here, we only prove TΩD also maps\nLt (ΩD) to GS (ΩD). Recall that [y] =\n\b\nyp + rω, ω ∈S\n\t\nand observe that\nEy (x) is left generalized partial-slice monogenic in Rp+q+1\\ [y]. We assume\nthat Ey (x) = I (F), x′ = (xp, r) ∈D. Set\nEy (x) = F1 (x′) + ωF2 (x′) ,\nwhere F = F1 + iF2 is the stem function which induces the generalized\npartial-slice monogenic function Ey (x) as in the deﬁnition. Therefore, we\nhave\nTΩDf (x) = −\nZ\nΩD\nKy (x) f (y) dσ (y)\n= −\nZ\nΩD\nEy (x)\nσq−1|yq|q−1 f (y) dσ (y)\n= −\n1\nσq−1\n\"Z\nΩD\nF1 (x′)\n|yq|q−1 f (y) dσ (y) + ω\nZ\nΩD\nF2 (x′)\n|yq|q−1 f (y) dσ (y)\n#\n.\nIf we let\nH (x′) = H1 (x′) + iH2 (x′)\n\n\n16\nManjie Hu, Chao Ding, Yifei Shen and Jiani Wang\n=\n\"\n−\n1\nσq−1\nZ\nΩD\nF1 (x′)\n|yq|q−1 f (y) dσ (y)\n#\n+ i\n\"\n−\n1\nσq−1\nZ\nΩD\nF2 (x′)\n|yq|q−1 f (y) dσ (y)\n#\n,\nthen since F1 (x′), F2 (x′), f (x) are all Rp+q-valued, we know that H1 (x′),\nH2 (x′) are both real Rp+q-valued. Further, since F is the stem function, we\nhave\nF1 (xp, −r) = F1 (xp, r) and F2 (xp, −r) = −F2 (xp, r) .\nSo we get\nH1 (xp, −r) = H1 (xp, r) and H2 (xp, −r) = −H2 (xp, r) ,\nand H (x′) is the stem function. Hence, the function TΩDf induced by H (x′)\nis a generalized partial-slice function, which completes the proof.\n□\nConclusion\nIn this article, we present some integral formulas, such as the Cauchy inte-\ngral formula for the exterior domain and the Plemelj-Sokhotski formula in\nthe theory of generalized partial-slice monogenic functions. Further, we start\nan investigation to the Teodorescu transform in this context and a norm es-\ntimation for the Teodorescu transform is introduced as well. This leads to a\nfurther study to some questions related to the Teodorescu transform. More\nspeciﬁcally, for instance, a Hodge decomposition, a generalized Π operator\nand a Vekua system can be investigated in the framework of generalized\npartial-slice monogenic functions.\nAcknowledgments\nThis article is dedicated to the memory of Professor Yuri Grigoriev.

{"text": "Integer-valued valuations\nAndrii Ilienko1,2, Ilya Molchanov1, and Tommaso Vison`a1\n1University of Bern\n2Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute\nMarch 3, 2025\nAbstract\nWe obtain a complete characterization of planar monotone σ-continuous valuations\ntaking integer values, without assuming invariance under any group of transformations.\nWe further investigate the consequences of dropping monotonicity or σ-continuity and\ngive a full classification of line valuations. We also introduce a construction of the\nproduct for valuations of this type.\nKeywords: valuation, normal cone, polyconvex set, product of valuations\nMSC2020: 52A10\n1\nIntroduction\nA valuation φ is an additive map from the family of compact convex subsets of a finite-\ndimensional vector space to an abelian semigroup. Additivity means that, for any compact\nconvex sets K and L such that K ∪L is also convex, the following identity holds:\nφ(K ∪L) + φ(K ∩L) = φ(K) + φ(L),\nsee [8, Chapter 6] for a detailed exposition. Additionally, we will always include the empty\nset in the domain of φ and assume that φ(∅) = 0. Most of the literature on valuations\nfocuses on valuations with values in the set of real or complex numbers or in the family of\ncompact convex sets equipped with Minkowski addition.\nA common assumption in the study of valuations is their invariance under a group of\ntransformations. In most cases, valuations are assumed to be translation invariant, meaning\nthat φ(K +x) = φ(K) for all translations x. Alternatively, valuations are also studied under\nthe assumption of rotation invariance or invariance under the group of all rigid motions.\nAnother frequently imposed condition is continuity with respect to the Hausdorff metric on\n1\narXiv:2502.21144v1  [math.MG]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\ncompact convex sets. This condition is sometimes relaxed to σ-continuity, which requires\nthat φ(Kn) →φ(K) whenever Kn ↓K.\nLet Kd be the family of convex bodies (i.e., compact convex sets) in Rd.\nWhile the\nempty set is typically not considered a convex body, we adopt the convention that it is\nincluded in Kd. By Hadwiger’s theorem, any real-valued continuous and invariant under\nrigid motions valuation on Kd can be expressed as a weighted sum of the intrinsic volumes\nVi(K), i = 0, . . . , d. Furthermore, MacMullen’s theorem states that the vector space of all\ncontinuous translation-invariant valuations can be decomposed into a direct sum of subspaces\nconsisting of valuations that are homogeneous of order k = 0, . . . , d. A more refined result\nis given by the theorem of Klain and Schneider. It states that if φ is a continuous simple\ntranslation-invariant valuation, then\nφ(K) = cVd(K) +\nZ\nSd−1 f(u) dSd−1(K, u),\nwhere c ∈R, f is an odd continuous function, and Sd−1(K, ·) stands for the area measure of\nK. Here, simplicity means that φ vanishes on all lower-dimensional sets.\nIn this paper, we consider valuations taking values in the group Z of integers under\naddition. Clearly, the only continuous valuations with values in Z are multiples of the Euler\ncharacteristic\nχ(K) =\n(\n1,\nK ̸= ∅,\n0,\nK = ∅.\nIt is straightforward to see that a sum of Euler characteristics like\nφ(K) =\nN\nX\ni=1\nχ(K ∩Ci)\nfor convex bodies C1, . . . , CN defines an integer-valued monotone σ-continuous valuation.\nDue to the intersection operation, φ is no longer continuous in the Hausdorff metric. Adding\nnegative terms to this sum preserves additivity and σ-continuity and may still retain the\nmonotonicity property, as our examples demonstrate.\nOur paper focuses on integer-valued monotone σ-continuous valuations without imposing\nany invariance assumptions and provides their complete characterization in dimensions 1 and\n2. In the main results, we establish that each integer-valued, monotone, and σ-continuous\nvaluation in dimensions 1 and 2 can be represented as an at most countable sum of Euler\ncharacteristics with weights ±1. The convex bodies Ci necessarily form a locally finite family,\nand the bodies appearing in the negative terms satisfy a strict admissibility property with\nrespect to the positive ones. In other words, each integer-valued monotone σ-continuous\nvaluation corresponds to a locally finite integer-valued measure on the family of convex\nbodies.\nA key step in proving the representation involves the support F of a valuation φ, which\nis the set of points x such that φ({x}) ≥1. We show that each integer-valued σ-continuous\nvaluation is uniquely determined by its values on singletons and that the intersection of F\n2\n\n\nwith any convex body is polyconvex. For the latter, we apply Eggleston’s theorem, which\nlinks polyconvexity to the structure of invisible points.\nThe absence of such a result in\ndimensions 3 and higher makes it impossible to generalize our technique beyond the planar\ncase.\nThe main result in dimension 2 is proved in Section 3. In Section 4 we characterise\nall real-valued valuations on the line.\nIn Section 5, we introduce countably generated\nvaluations, which generalize the weighted sums of Euler characteristics discussed above.\nWe then define the multiplication of such valuations by arbitrary σ-continuous ones and\nexamine the properties of this product. Section 6 contains a collection of open problems and\nconjectures.\n2\nPreliminaries on integer-valued valuations\nA set function φ : Kd →R is called monotone if φ(K) ≤φ(L) whenever K ⊂L.\nIn\nparticular, this implies nonnegativity: φ(K) ≥φ(∅) = 0.\nFollowing [8, p. 338], we call a valuation φ σ-continuous if\nφ(K) = lim\nn→∞φ(Kn)\n(1)\nfor any sequence (Kn) of convex bodies such that Kn ↓K. First of all, we note that, for\ninteger-valued valuations, it suffices to check σ-continuity only at singletons.\nProposition 2.1. Let φ be an integer-valued valuation on Kd such that (1) holds for all\nK = {x}, x ∈Rd. Then φ is σ-continuous.\nProof. Assume that the claim is false, and (1) fails to hold for some Kn ↓K. Then φ(Kn) ̸=\nφ(K) for infinitely many n. For all such n and for any hyperplane H1 meeting K and dividing\nRd into closed half-spaces H−\n1 and H+\n1 , we have\nφ(K) = φ(K ∩H−\n1 ) + φ(K ∩H+\n1 ) −φ(K ∩H1),\nφ(Kn) = φ(Kn ∩H−\n1 ) + φ(Kn ∩H+\n1 ) −φ(Kn ∩H1).\nHence, there is H•\n1 ∈{H−\n1 , H+\n1 , H1} such that φ(K ∩H•\n1) ̸= φ(Kn ∩H•\n1) for infinitely many\nn. Proceeding with this division process and choosing Hm and H•\nm at the m-th step in such\na way that K ∩H•\n1 ∩. . . ∩H•\nm shrink to a singleton {x} as m →∞, we obtain\nφ(K ∩H•\n1 ∩. . . ∩H•\nm) ̸= φ(Kn ∩H•\n1 ∩. . . ∩H•\nm)\n(2)\nfor each fixed m and infinitely many n.\nHowever, due to the σ-continuity of φ at {x},\nboth sides of (2) converge to φ({x}) as m, n →∞simultaneously. Since both sides are\ninteger-valued, this contradicts (2).\nDenote H−\nu,t = {x ∈Rd : ⟨u, x⟩≤t}. The following criterion is useful for verifying the\nmonotonicity of a (not necessarily additive) σ-continuous set function.\n3\n\n\nProposition 2.2. A non-negative σ-continuous set function φ on Kd is monotone if and\nonly if φ(H−\nu,t ∩M) is non-decreasing in t for each fixed u ∈Sd−1 and M ∈Kd.\nProof. The necessity is clear. To prove sufficiency, let K ⊂L, choose an x1 ∈∂K, and\ndraw through x1 a supporting hyperplane H1 to K. Denote by L1 the part of L cut off by\nH1 and containing K. Using the assumption with u orthogonal to H1 and M = L, we get\nφ(L) ≥φ(L1). Proceeding with this process and choosing xn ∈∂K and Hn at each step\nin such a way that Ln ↓K, we obtain, by applying the assumption to M = Ln−1, that\nφ(Ln−1) ≥φ(Ln). Thus, φ(L) ≥φ(Ln), and, by σ-continuity, φ(L) ≥φ(K).\nNote that, as follows from the proof, this proposition remains valid even if σ-continuity\nis replaced by a significantly weaker condition φ(K) ≤supn≥1 φ(Kn) for any Kn ↓K.\nWe now give a somewhat unexpected property of integer-valued σ-continuous valuations,\nwhich plays a fundamental role in what follows.\nProposition 2.3. Let φ and φ′ be integer-valued σ-continuous valuations on Kd that coincide\non singletons: φ({x}) = φ′({x}) for any x ∈Rd. Then φ = φ′.\nProof. We employ reasoning similar to that used in the proof of Proposition 2.1. Suppose\nthe claim is false and φ(K) ̸= φ′(K) for some K ∈Kd. Drawing a hyperplane H that meets\nK and denoting the closed half-spaces it cuts off by H−and H+, we have\nφ(K ∩H−) + φ(K ∩H+) −φ(K ∩H) = φ(K)\n̸= φ′(K) = φ′(K ∩H−) + φ′(K ∩H+) −φ′(K ∩H).\nThus, φ(K1) ̸= φ′(K1) for some K1 ∈{K ∩H−, K ∩H+, K ∩H}. Proceeding with this\nprocess so that Kn ↓{x} for some x ∈Rd, we have φ(Kn) ̸= φ′(Kn) for all n, while, by\nσ-continuity,\nlim\nn→∞φ(Kn) = φ({x}) = φ′({x}) = lim\nn→∞φ′(Kn).\nThis is impossible due to the integer-valued property of φ and φ′.\nProposition 2.3 implies that no simple (i.e., vanishing on lower-dimensional sets) integer-\nvalued σ-continuous valuations exist. Any such valuation must vanish on singletons and is\ntherefore identically zero.\n3\nThe structure of planar integer-valued valuations\nIn this section, we describe the structure of planar integer-valued monotone σ-continuous\nvaluations. Recall that the normal cone to a closed convex set C at a point x ∈C is defined\nby\nNC(x) =\n\b\nu ∈Rd : ⟨u, y −x⟩≤0 for all y ∈C\n\t\n(3)\n4\n\n\nand adopt the convention NC(x) = ∅for x /∈C. In particular,\n1NC(x)(0) = 1C(x),\n(4)\n1NC(x)(u) = 1C(x) · 1{C ∩\n◦H+\nu (x) = ∅},\nu ̸= 0,\n(5)\nwhere\n◦H+\nu (x) = {y ∈Rd : ⟨u, y −x⟩> 0}.\nThis means that NC(x) is empty for x /∈C, contains only 0 for x ∈int C, and is a non-\ndegenerate closed convex cone for x ∈∂C. Also denote N0 = N ∪{0, ∞}.\nDefinition 3.1.\n(i) A family of N ∈N0 closed convex sets Cn is said to be locally finite if only finitely\nmany of them hit any fixed K ∈Kd.\n(ii) A locally finite family (C−\nn ) of cardinality N −is said to be admissible with respect to\na locally finite family (C+\nn ) of cardinality N + if\nN−\nX\nn=1\n1NC−\nn (x)(u) ≤\nN+\nX\nn=1\n1NC+\nn (x)(u)\n(6)\nfor all x, u ∈Rd.\nIn particular, (6) implies that S\nn C−\nn ⊂S\nn C+\nn by letting u = 0 and using (4). Further-\nmore, (6) yields that S\nn ∂C−\nn ⊂S\nn ∂C+\nn . Otherwise, for any x violating this inclusion, the\nright-hand side of (6) vanishes for all u ̸= 0, while the left-hand side does not for some u.\nThe simplest example of an integer-valued monotone σ-continuous valuation is provided\nby the Euler characteristic\nχ(K) = 1{K ̸= ∅},\nK ∈Kd.\nThe following theorem provides a complete description of such valuations for d = 2.\nTheorem 3.2. A function φ : K2 →Z is an integer-valued monotone σ-continuous valuation\nif and only if there exist N +, N −∈N0 and two locally finite families of N + and N −nonempty\nclosed convex sets C+\nn and C−\nn with the latter being admissible with respect to the former,\nsuch that, for any K ∈K2,\nφ(K) =\nN+\nX\nn=1\nχ\u0000K ∩C+\nn\n\u0001\n−\nN−\nX\nn=1\nχ\u0000K ∩C−\nn\n\u0001\n.\n(7)\nThe families (C+\nn ) and (C−\nn ) are not uniquely determined: (C+\nn ), (C−\nn ) and ( eC+\nn ), ( eC−\nn ) define\nthe same valuation if and only if\nN+\nX\nn=1\n1C+\nn (x) −\nN−\nX\nn=1\n1C−\nn (x) =\ne\nN+\nX\nn=1\n1 eC+\nn (x) −\ne\nN−\nX\nn=1\n1 eC−\nn (x)\n(8)\nfor all x ∈R2.\n5\n\n\nThe non-uniqueness of the representation (7) is confirmed by the following example.\nExample 3.3. Let C1 and C2 be two convex bodies such that C1 ∪C2 is convex. Then the\nvaluation φ(K) = χ(K ∩(C1 ∪C2)) can be alternatively represented as\nφ(K) = χ(K ∩C1) + χ(K ∩C2) −χ(K ∩(C1 ∩C2)).\nSince both sides agree on singletons, this follows from Proposition 2.3.\nThe following examples demonstrate that not all monotone valuations can be constructed\nusing only C+\nn .\nExample 3.4. Let a, b and c be segments positioned as shown in Figure 1(a) with O denoting\ntheir intersection point.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 1\nConsider the valuation\nφ(K) = χ(K ∩a) + χ(K ∩b) + χ(K ∩c) −χ(K ∩{O}),\nK ∈K2.\nThis valuation is integer-valued σ-continuous and monotone. To prove monotonicity, note\nthat φ(K) = 0 means that K and a∪b∪c are disjoint, and φ(K) = 1 means that K intersects\nexactly one of these segments. Thus, for φ(K) ≤1 and K′ ⊂K, we have φ(K′) ≤φ(K). If\nφ(K) = 2, the latter inequality holds because φ(K′) ≤2 for all K′ ∈K2.\nAnother way to prove the monotonicity of φ is to verify the admissibility of ({O}) with\nrespect to (a, b, c). From (3), it easily follows that N{O}(O) = R2, and for any s ∈{a, b, c},\nNs(O) is a closed half-plane that does not contain int s, with its boundary passing through\nO and orthogonal to s. Since the union of these three half-planes is the entire plane, (6)\nholds for x = O. At all other points, (6) holds trivially, as its left-hand side vanishes for any\nu. Hence, φ is monotone by Theorem 3.2.\n6\n\n\nExample 3.5. Now consider the valuation\nφ = χ(· ∩A) + χ(· ∩B) + χ(· ∩{O}) −χ(· ∩A ∩B),\nsee Figure 1(b). It is also integer-valued σ-continuous and monotone; both proofs of monotonicity\nare similar to those in Example 3.4. Note that without the term χ(·∩O), the valuation would\nbe non-monotone. Altering the positions of the lines bordering A∩B (while maintaining their\nnonempty intersection) does not change the valuation but leads to its different representation.\nWe will precede the proof of Theorem 3.2 with two auxiliary lemmas. For the first one,\nwe call a point set P an invisibility set if φ({x}) ≥1 for each x ∈P, and, for any x, y ∈P,\nthere exists a point z ∈(x, y) such that φ({z}) = 0. We denote the convex hull of a set P by\nconv P and write card P for the cardinality of P. Note that the bound on the cardinality of\nP in the following result is apparently far from optimal one, but it suffices for our purposes.\nLemma 3.6. Let φ be an integer-valued monotone valuation on K2 and n ∈N. If there\nexists an invisibility set P with card P ≥4n, then φ(conv P) > n\n2.\nProof. We proceed by induction on n. For n = 1, the claim is clear. Assume it holds for\nn −1. Arguing by contradiction, suppose that φ(conv P) ≤n\n2.\nAs before, for a line H, we denote by H−and H+ the two closed half-planes into which\nH divides R2. Draw H in such a way that card(P ∩H−) ≥22n−1 and card(P ∩H+) ≥22n−1.\nWith a slight adjustment, H can always be made to pass through some x, y ∈P. Mark\nz ∈(x, y) with φ({z}) = 0, and denote by a, b the intersection points of H and ∂conv P.\nConnect z by line segments to some u, v ∈∂conv P in such a way as to divide P ∩H−\nand P ∩H+ into four closed convex polygons Q−−, Q−+, Q+−, Q++ with card Qij ≥4n−1,\ni, j ∈{−, +}, see Figure 2 for n = 2.\nFigure 2\nOne of the polygons Q−−∪Q+−or Q−+∪Q++ is convex, depending on whether the angle\n∠uzv is ≤π or ≥π. Assume the former. Since\nφ([a, z]) = φ([a, b]) + φ({z}) −φ([z, b]) ≤φ(conv P) −φ({y}) ≤n\n2 −1,\n7\n\n\napplying the induction hypothesis to Q−−and Q+−yields the contradiction:\nn\n2 ≥φ(conv P) ≥φ(Q−−∪Q+−)\n= φ(Q−−) + φ(Q+−) −φ([a, z]) > 2 n −1\n2\n−\n\u0010n\n2 −1\n\u0011\n= n\n2.\nRecall that a set is said to be polyconvex if it is a finite union of (not necessarily disjoint)\nconvex sets. In particular, the empty set is also considered as polyconvex.\nLemma 3.7. Let φ be an integer-valued monotone σ-continuous valuation defined on closed\nconvex subsets of some W ∈K2. Then its support\nF = {x ∈W : φ({x}) ≥1}\nis polyconvex, and all its convex components are closed.\nBefore proceeding to the proof, we recall a fact from convex geometry. For m ≥2, a\nset S ⊂R2 is called m-convex if, for any m distinct points in S, at least one of the line\nsegments connecting them lies in S. In particular, 2-convex sets are just convex. According\nto Eggleston’s theorem [3], a closed m-convex set is polyconvex. Note that an extensive\nliterature has been devoted to deriving upper bounds on the number of convex components,\nsee [2], [6], [7], etc.\nProof of Lemma 3.7. We first note that F is closed.\nIndeed, if F ∋xk →x, then, for\nsome closed convex neighbourhood Vx of x and some k ≥1, we have by σ-continuity and\nmonotonicity that\nφ({x}) = φ(Vx) ≥φ({xk}) ≥1.\nThis implies x ∈F.\nTake any set P of m = 42φ(W) points from F. At least one of the line segments connecting\nthem lies entirely in F: otherwise, they would form an invisibility set, and by Lemma 3.6,\nwe would arrive at the contradiction φ(W) ≥φ(conv P) > φ(W). Hence, by Eggleston’s\ntheorem, F = Sl\ni=1 Ki for some l ≥0 and convex Ki. Taking the closures of both sides of\nthis equality and recalling that F is closed, we arrive at the desired representation.\nProof of Theorem 3.2.\nSufficiency. The set function φ given by (7) is an integer-valued σ-continuous valuation, since\nit is a sum of such valuations and, due to local finiteness, this sum has only finitely many\nnonzero terms for each K. The only thing that remains to be proved is its monotonicity.\nTaking u = 0 in (6) and using (4), we have\nφ({x}) =\nN+\nX\nn=1\n1C+\nn (x) −\nN−\nX\nn=1\n1C−\nn (x) ≥0,\nx ∈R2.\n(9)\nWe will now show that K ⊂L implies φ(K) ≤φ(L). In particular, combined with (9), this\nensures φ(K) ≥0 for any K.\n8\n\n\nDenote by F0 the family of all sets C+\nn and C−\nn which appear in (7). Fix K0 = K ⊂L,\nand define F1 to be the family of all sets from F0 that hit L while missing K0. Due to local\nfiniteness, F1 is finite, and it is possible to find a δ > 0 such that the family of sets from\nF0 which hit L + Bδ(0) while missing K0 is exactly F1. Here + stands for the Minkowski\naddition. Now replace all sets C±\nn from the family F1 by their intersections with L. This\ndoes not affect the values of φ on L and its subsets.\nWe claim that there exist\n1) a point x1 ∈L on the boundary of some set from F1,\n2) a supporting line H1 at x1 to this set that separates its interior from K0,\n3) a segment Sε1 on H1 of small length 2ε1 with ε1 < δ/ card F1 centered at x1, such that\nSε1 hits the same sets from F0 as {x1} and conv(K0 ∪Sε1) \\ Sε1 does not intersect any\nset from F1,\nsee Figure 3, where, for simplicity, the sets C+\nn and C−\nn , shown in gray, are depicted as\ndisjoint. The above construction can be carried out by choosing x1 to be the minimizer r of\nthe function x 7→infz∈K0 ∥z −x∥for all points x from any of the sets in the family F1. In\nthe case of multiple minimizers, any of them can be chosen. Note as well that this minimizer\nmay belong to several sets, say Ci1, . . . , Cip, from F1. The r-parallel set Kr\n0 is smooth at x,\nso there is a unique supporting line which then becomes H1. Since any other set from F1 is\nfarther away from K0 than r, none of them intersects conv(K0 ∪Sε1) for a sufficiently small\nsegment Sε1 on H1 centered at x1. Furthermore, since ∂Kr\n0 is smooth at x1, no set from\nCi1, . . . , Cip intersects conv(K0 ∪Sε1) \\ Sε1.\nFigure 3\nDenote K1 = conv(K0 ∪Sε1) and observe that K0 ⊂K1 ⊂L + Bε1(0). Let F2 be the\nfamily of sets from F0 (actually, from F1) that hit L while missing K1. Now repeat the\n9\n\n\nabove process first with K1, F2, x2, H2, ε2 instead of K0, F1, x1, H1, ε1, and, similarly, at the\nsubsequent steps. This process terminates at step m ≤card F1, when Fm+1 = ∅. Then\nKm ⊂L + Bε(0) with ε = P εi < δ. Then the sets Km, L, and L + Bε(0) hit the same sets\nfrom the collection F0. Hence, φ(Km) = φ(L), and, to prove monotonicity, it remains to\nshow that φ(Ki−1) ≤φ(Ki) for each i = 1, . . . , m.\nSince conv(Ki−1 ∪Sεi) \\ Sεi does not hit any set from Fi, the increment of φ between\nKi−1 and Ki is determined exclusively by those C+\nn and C−\nn that hit Sεi but miss the open\nhalf-plane\n◦H+\nui(xi) bounded by Hi and containing Ki−1. By the choice of εi, such a set hits\nSεi if and only if it contains xi. Hence,\nφ(Ki) −φ(Ki−1) =\nN+\nX\nn=1\n1C+\nn (xi) · 1{C+\nn ∩\n◦H+\nui(xi) = ∅}\n−\nN−\nX\nn=1\n1C−\nn (xi) · 1{C−\nn ∩\n◦H+\nui(xi) = ∅},\nwhich is non-negative by (5) and (6).\nNecessity. We first prove that (7) holds with some locally finite families (C+\nn ) and (C−\nn ) and\nafterwards address the admissibility of (C−\nn ) with respect to (C+\nn ). To begin with, assume\nthat φ is supported by a subset of a fixed set W ∈K2. By monotonicity,\nMφ = sup\nx∈W\nφ({x}) ≤φ(W) < ∞.\nWe will proceed by induction on Mφ.\nIf Mφ = 0, then, comparing φ with the zero valuation using Proposition 2.3, we get\nφ = 0, so that the claim holds with N + = N −= 0.\nNow let Mφ = k, k ≥1, and suppose the claim has been established for any valuation\nφ′ on W such that Mφ′ ≤k −1. By Lemma 3.7, the support of φ is F = Sl\ni=1 Ki for some\nl ≥1 and closed convex sets K1, . . . , Kl ⊂W. Denote by φ|L = φ(· ∩L) the restriction of φ\nto L ∈K2, and consider the valuation\nφ∗= χ|F +\nl\nX\nr=1\n(−1)r−1\nX\n1≤i1<...<ir≤l\n(φ −χ)|Ki1∩...∩Kir.\n(10)\nThe valuations φ and φ∗coincide on singletons: if x ∈F belongs to exactly m sets from\nK1, . . . , Kl and φ({x}) = p, then\nφ∗({x}) = 1 + (p −1)\nm\nX\nr=1\n(−1)r−1\n\u0012m\nr\n\u0013\n= p.\nHence, by Proposition 2.3, φ = φ∗.\nThe valuation φ′ = (φ −χ)|Ki1∩...∩Kir is integer-\nvalued monotone σ-continuous, and Mφ′ ≤k −1. Thus, by the induction hypothesis, it\n10\n\n\nis of the required form. Substituting the expression (7) for φ′ into (10) yields the required\nrepresentation for φ∗= φ.\nNow consider an integer-valued monotone σ-continuous valuation φ on the entire K2. For\ni, j ∈Z, denote\nQi,j = [i, i + 1] × [j, j + 1],\nEi,j = [i, i + 1] × {j},\nE′\ni,j = {i} × [j, j + 1],\nVi,j = {i} × {j}.\nNote that R2 = S\ni,j∈Z Qi,j, and double, triple, and quadruple intersections of distinct\ncomponents take the form of Ei,j, E′\ni,j, or Vi,j, while the intersections of higher orders are\nempty. The restriction of φ to any of these sets is an integer-valued monotone σ-continuous\nvaluation as well.\nHence, by the reasoning above, these restrictions are of the required\nform. Applying an analogue of (10) to the countable collection of sets Qi,j with intersections\nbeyond the fourth order being empty, we obtain the required form of φ.\nWe now prove that (C−\nn ) is admissible with respect to (C+\nn ). Since φ({x}) ≥0 for any\nx, we have\nN−\nX\nn=1\n1C−\nn (x) ≤\nN+\nX\nn=1\n1C+\nn (x),\nwhich, by (4), implies (6) for u = 0. Fix some x and u ̸= 0, and let\np+ =\nN+\nX\nn=1\n1C+\nn (x),\np−=\nN−\nX\nn=1\n1C−\nn (x),\nq+ =\nN+\nX\nn=1\n1C+\nn (x) · 1{C+\nn ∩\n◦H+\nu (x) = ∅},\nq−=\nN−\nX\nn=1\n1C−\nn (x) · 1{C−\nn ∩\n◦H+\nu (x) = ∅}.\n(11)\nIf (6) is violated for x and u, then by (5), we have q+ −q−< 0. It follows from (11) that\nN+\nX\nn=1\n1C+\nn (x) · 1{C+\nn ∩\n◦H+\nu (x) ̸= ∅} −\nN−\nX\nn=1\n1C−\nn (x) · 1{C−\nn ∩\n◦H+\nu (x) ̸= ∅}\n= (p+ −q+) −(p−−q−) = (p+ −p−) −(q+ −q−) > (p+ −p−) = φ({x}).\n(12)\nDue to local finiteness, there are a disk Bε(x) that hits the same C+\nn and C−\nn as {x} and a\nclosed convex set K, approximating Bε(x) ∩\n◦H+\nu (x) from the inside, that hits the same C+\nn\nand C−\nn as Bε(x) ∩\n◦H+\nu (x). Hence, the left-hand side of (12) is φ(K), while the right-hand\nside is φ(Bε(x)), which contradicts monotonicity.\nTo prove the final claim of the theorem, it suffices to note that (8) means the equality\nof the corresponding valuations on singletons. By Proposition 2.3, this implies their overall\nequality.\nRemark 3.8. Note that, in fact, we constructed the representation (7) with components C+\nn\nand C−\nn that are not only closed and convex but also bounded, meaning they belong to\nK2. However, using unbounded components is often convenient. For example, for the Euler\ncharacteristic χ, we can simply take N + = 1, N −= 0 and C+\n1 = R2.\n11\n\n\nThe proof that the admissibility of (C−\nn ) with respect to (C+\nn ) is both necessary and\nsufficient for the monotonicity of φ extends to any dimension along the same lines.\nIn\nother words, if a valuation φ on Kd has the form (7) with some locally finite families (C+\nn )\nand (C−\nn ), then it is monotone if and only if (C−\nn ) is admissible with respect to (C+\nn ) in\nthe sense of Definition 3.1(ii). However, the necessity of the representation (7) beyond the\ntwo-dimensional setting remains an open question: the most critical part of the proof relies\non an application of Eggleston’s theorem, and little is known about its validity in higher\ndimensions.\nThe σ-continuity condition imposed in Theorem 3.2 is crucial. If it is omitted, the class of\ninteger-valued monotone valuations expands. This is illustrated by the following examples,\nwhich work in spaces of any dimension.\nExample 3.9. If N −= 0, then the right-hand side of (7), written in the form of\nφ =\nN+\nX\nn=1\n1{· ∩C+\nn ̸= ∅},\ndefines an integer-valued monotone valuation even if the sets C+\nn are not necessarily closed.\nExample 3.10. For u ∈Sd−1, denote by Hu the supporting hyperplane of K with outer\nnormal u and set Ku = K \\ (K ∩Hu). Thus, Ku is K with one exposed face removed. For\nN + ∈N0, a set {un} ⊂Sd−1 and a locally finite set {xn} ⊂Rd, both of cardinality N +,\ndefine\nφ(K) =\nN+\nX\nn=1\n1{xn ∈Kun},\nK ∈Kd.\n(13)\nThe monotonicity of (13) is clear. To prove additivity, we first note that, for K, L ∈Kd with\nconvex union,\n(K ∪L)u = Ku ∪Lu\nand\n(K ∩L)u = Ku ∩Lu.\nThe only two non-trivial inclusions here are the direct one in the first equality and the\nreverse one in the second.\nLet H+\nu,x stand for the open half-space with inner normal u\nwhose boundary contains x. If x ∈(K ∪L)u, then x belongs to, say, K, and there exists\ny ∈H+\nu,x ∩(K ∪L). If y ∈K, we have x ∈Ku. If, however, y ∈L, then, due to convexity\nof K ∪L, there exists z ∈[x, y] ∩K ∩L. If z = x, we have x, y ∈L, and thus x ∈Lu. If\nz ̸= x, then x, z ∈K, and so x ∈Ku. This proves the direct inclusion in the first equality.\nNow let x ∈Ku ∩Lu. Then x ∈K ∩L and there exist y1 ∈H+\nu,x ∩K, y2 ∈H+\nu,x ∩L.\nAgain, due to convexity of K ∪L, there is z ∈[y1, y2] ∩K ∩L. Hence, z ∈H+\nu,x ∩(K ∩L),\nand so x ∈(K ∩L)u. This proves the reverse inclusion in the second inequality.\nThe additivity of each summand in (13) follows from the identity\n1{xn ∈Kun} + 1{xn ∈Lun} = 1{xn ∈Kun ∪Lun} + 1{xn ∈Kun ∩Lun}\n= 1{xn ∈(K ∪L)un} + 1{xn ∈(K ∩L)un}.\nThe general case follows by linearity and, if necessary, by passing to the limit.\n12\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that, in the one-dimensional case, all discontinuous integer-valued\nmonotone valuations are fully characterized by a combination of these two examples. This\nfollows from Theorem 4.1(iv) in the next section.\nOn the other hand, for σ-continuous\nvaluations with the monotonicity condition dropped, the representation (7) may also fail\neven in the one-dimensional setting, as demonstrated by Examples 4.2 and 4.3 in the next\nsection. This confirms that the Jordan decomposition does not hold for integer-valued σ-\ncontinuous valuations.\n4\nValuations on the line\nIn this section, we will explore the structure of valuations on K1, with a focus on integer-\nvalued valuations that possess some additional properties such as monotonicity or σ-conti-\nnuity. In particular, it will be shown that, in the one-dimensional analogue of Theorem 3.2, it\nis always possible to set N −= 0, thus restricting the right-hand side of (7) to positive terms\nonly. The one-dimensional case is, of course, much simpler than the planar one, which allows\nus to provide in the following theorem a complete characterization of all one-dimensional\nvaluations with certain properties.\nWe will use the double angle brackets ⟨⟨p, q⟩⟩, −∞≤p ≤q ≤∞, to denote any of the\nfour types of intervals: closed, semi-open, or open. If p = −∞or q = ∞, the interval on the\ncorresponding side can only be open. If p = q, then ⟨⟨p, q⟩⟩= [p, p] = {p}.\nTheorem 4.1. Let φ be an arbitrary valuation on K1 = {[a, b]: a ≤b}. Then there exist\ntwo unique functions f, g: R →R with f(0) = 0 such that φ([a, b]) = g(b) −f(a) for any\na ≤b. Conversely, any such pair of functions defines a valuation. Moreover,\n(i) φ is integer-valued if and only if f and g are integer-valued;\n(ii) φ is monotone if and only if f and g are non-decreasing and f ≤g;\n(iii) φ is σ-continuous if and only if f is left-continuous and g is right-continuous;\n(iv) φ is integer-valued and monotone if and only if there exist N1, N2, N3 ∈N0, a locally\nfinite family of N1 intervals ⟨⟨pn, qn⟩⟩, and two locally finite sets of N2 (resp., N3) points\nrn (resp., sn), such that, for each [a, b] ∈K1,\nφ([a, b]) =\nN1\nX\nn=1\n1\n\b\n[a, b] ∩⟨⟨pn, qn⟩⟩̸= ∅\n\t\n+\nN2\nX\nn=1\n1{rn ∈(a, b]} +\nN3\nX\nn=1\n1{sn ∈[a, b)};\n(14)\n(v) φ is integer-valued monotone and σ-continuous if and only if there exist N ∈N0 and\na locally finite family of N closed intervals [pn, qn], such that, for each [a, b] ∈K1,\nφ([a, b]) =\nN\nX\nn=1\n1\n\b\n[a, b] ∩[pn, qn] ̸= ∅\n\t\n.\n13\n\n\nNote that, unlike the terms in the last two sums of (14), 1{t ∈(a, b)} is not a valuation:\nadditivity is violated, e.g., for K = [t −1, t] and L = [t, t + 1]. Moreover, (14) can be seen\nas a combination of Examples 3.9 and 3.10 in the one-dimensional setting.\nProof of Theorem 4.1. The difference g(b) −f(a) clearly satisfies additivity and so defines a\nvaluation. Conversely, for the valuation φ, define\nf(x) =\n(\nφ([0, x]) −φ({x}),\nx ≥0,\nφ({0}) −φ([x, 0]),\nx < 0,\ng(x) =\n(\nφ([0, x]),\nx ≥0,\nφ({x}) + φ({0}) −φ([x, 0]),\nx < 0.\n(15)\nThen f(0) = 0 and, for 0 ≤a ≤b, we have by additivity\nφ([a, b]) = φ([0, b]) −φ([0, a]) + φ({a}) = g(b) −f(a).\nThe other two cases, a ≤b < 0 and a < 0 ≤b, are treated similarly.\nIn (i), the “only” part follows from (15), while the “if” part from φ([a, b]) = g(b) −f(a).\nThe same equality easily yields both parts in (ii) and (iii).\nThe “if” part in (iv) follows from Examples 3.9 and 3.10. We now prove the “only if”\npart in (iv). Let φ({c}) = m = minx∈R φ({x}) and φ′ = φ(· −c) −m. Then φ′ is an\ninteger-valued monotone valuation with φ′({0}) = 0. Hence, for its functions f and g, we\nhave f(0) = g(0) = 0. It follows from the previous claims that f and g are non-decreasing\nstep functions with integer jumps, and f ≤g. To each point x > 0 where g has a left\ndiscontinuity, i.e., g(x) −g(x−) ≥1, we associate a pattern of g(x) −g(x−) consecutive\nidentical entries “[x”. In a similar manner, handle the right discontinuities of g, denoting\ntheir positions as “(x”, x ≥0. Then proceed similarly with the left and right discontinuities\nof f, using the notation “x)” and “x]”, respectively.\nFinally, combine these patterns in\nincreasing order of x into a single, at most countable sequence. In the case of patterns with\nthe same x, they should be arranged in the following order: [x . . . (x . . . x) . . . x] . . .. The\nresulting sequence encodes both f and g on [0, ∞).\nFor example, for the functions\nf = 21(0,2) + 31{2} + 51(2,4] + 71(4,6] + 101(6,∞),\ng = 31(0,1] + 41(1,2] + 51(2,4) + 61{4} + 71(4,6) + 81{6} + 121(6,∞),\nusing this algorithm, we obtain the following sequence:\n(0 (0 (0 0] 0] (1 (2 2) 2] 2] [4 (4 4] 4] [6 (6 (6 (6 (6 6] 6] 6].\nNow, for the first opening bracket, find the nearest closing one on the right, note the resulting\ninterval, remove the used pair from the sequence and repeat the procedure. If there are not\n14\n\n\nenough closing brackets, use ∞) as many times as needed. In the above example, we arrive\nat the following set of intervals:\n(0, 0], (0, 0], (0, 2), (1, 2], (2, 2], [4, 4], (4, 4], [6, 6], (6, 6], (6, 6], (6, ∞), (6, ∞).\nThe resulting intervals can be real, such as the four types of ⟨⟨p, q⟩⟩, or virtual, such as\n[r, r) and (s, s]. A virtual interval (t, t) is impossible by construction due to the condition\nf ≤g. Along the same lines, a similar list of real and virtual intervals can be constructed\non (−∞, 0].\nConsider the valuation φ′′ constructed according to (14), by incorporating the real inter-\nvals ⟨⟨pn, qn⟩⟩into the terms of the first sum, and the points rn, sn defining the virtual\nintervals into the terms of the second and third sums. Calculating by (15) the functions\nfn and gn corresponding to all six types of terms in (14), it is easy to see that the step\nfunctions f and g for φ′′ have the same positions and structure of discontinuities as those\nfor φ′. Hence, these functions coincide, and so φ′′ = φ′. Thus, φ′ takes the form of (14).\nShifting φ′ to the right by c and adding m = m1{[a, b] ∩(−∞, ∞) ̸= ∅}, we arrive at the\nrequired representation for φ.\nThe “if” part in (v) is clear. The “only if” part follows from (iv) and the fact that all\nother terms in (14) are easily seen not to be σ-continuous.\nWe can now give the examples announced at the end of Section 3, which demonstrate\nthat, even in the one-dimensional case, the representation (7) may fail if the monotonicity\ncondition on the valuation is dropped.\nExample 4.2. Let\nf = 0\nand\ng =\n∞\nX\nn=1\n1[ 2n−1\n2n ,\n2n\n2n+1).\nBy Theorem 4.1, φ([a, b]) = g(b) −f(a) = g(b) defines an integer-valued σ-continuous\nvaluation on K1. Since the pair (fp,q, gp,q) = (0, 1[p,q)) corresponds to the valuation\nφp,q([a, b]) = 1{b ∈[p, q)} = 1{[a, b] ∩[p, q] ̸= ∅} −1{[a, b] ∩{q} ̸= ∅},\nwe arrive at the representation\nφ([a, b]) =\n∞\nX\nn=1\n1{[a, b] ∩C+\nn ̸= ∅} −\n∞\nX\nn=1\n1{[a, b] ∩C−\nn ̸= ∅}\n=\n∞\nX\nn=1\nχ{[a, b] ∩C+\nn } −\n∞\nX\nn=1\nχ{[a, b] ∩C−\nn },\n(16)\nwhere C+\nn =\n\u00022n−1\n2n ,\n2n\n2n+1\n\u0003\n, C−\nn =\n\b\n2n\n2n+1\n\t\n, and ∞−∞= 0 by convention. The families (C+\nn )\nand (C−\nn ) are not locally finite.\n15\n\n\nExample 4.3. Let f = 0 and g(x) =\n\u0004\n1\n1−x\n\u0005\n· 1(−∞,1), x ∈R. Since g = P∞\nn=1 1[ n−1\nn ,1),\nthe above reasoning leads to (16) with C+\nn =\n\u0002n−1\nn , 1\n\u0003\n, C−\nn = {1} for all n, and the same\nconvention. This time, the families (C+\nn ) and (C−\nn ) are neither locally finite, nor is the sum\nin (8) even well defined.\nIn both of the above examples, there are no other locally finite families ( eC+\nn ) and ( eC−\nn ).\nIndeed, denoting yk =\nk\nk+1, we have by (16) that φ({yk}) ̸= φ({yk+1}) for k ≥1. Hence, on\neach interval [yk, yk+1], there must be a point from some ∂eC+\nn or ∂eC−\nn . This contradicts the\nlocal finiteness.\n5\nMultiplication of countably generated valuations\nTheorems 3.2 and 4.1(v) lead us to the following general definition.\nDefinition 5.1. A valuation φ on Kd is called countably generated if there exist N ∈N0, a\nlocally finite family of N nonempty closed convex sets Cn, and a set of N real numbers αn\nsuch that\nφ(K) =\nN\nX\nn=1\nαn χ\u0000K ∩Cn\n\u0001\n,\nK ∈Kd.\n(17)\nWhile in Definition 5.1 the sets Cn were assumed to be only closed and convex, an\nequivalent representation with compact Cn follows from the inclusion-exclusion argument\nused in the proof of Theorem 3.2.\nThe above theorems show that any integer-valued monotone σ-continuous valuation on\nK1 or K2 is countably generated with all αn = 1 if d = 1 and αn = ±1 if d = 2.\nAny countably generated valuation is clearly σ-continuous. Let Vd stand for the vector\nspace of all σ-continuous valuations on Kd equipped with the natural operations of addition\nand multiplication by real numbers, and denote by Gd its subspace of countably generated\nvaluations. Note that elements of Gd are completely determined by their values on singletons:\nif φ, φ′ ∈Gd are defined by N, (αn), (Cn) and N ′, (α′\nn), (C′\nn), respectively, then φ = φ′ if and\nonly if\nN\nX\nn=1\nαn1Cn =\nN′\nX\nn=1\nα′\nn1C′n.\n(18)\nThis can be proved along the same lines as Proposition 2.3.\nFor a countably generated valuation, multiplication by a σ-continuous valuation can be\ndefined as follows. For ψ ∈Vd and φ ∈Gd given by (17), define\n(φ · ψ)(K) =\nN\nX\nn=1\nαnψ(K ∩Cn),\nK ∈Kd.\n(19)\nThe terms on the right-hand side are well defined, since K∩Cn ∈Kd for all n. If N = ∞, only\na finite number of them are non-zero due to the local finiteness of (Cn). Finally, the value of\n16\n\n\nthe sum on the right-hand side of (19) does not depend on the specific choice of N, (αn), (Cn)\nin the representation of φ by (17). Indeed, this sum is the Groemer integral of PN\nn=1 αn1K∩Cn\nwith respect to ψ, see [5]. This integral is well defined for ψ ∈Vd by Theorem 3 in the same\npaper. It remains to note that, for another set N ′, (α′\nn), (C′\nn) corresponding to φ, we have\nN′\nX\nn=1\nα′\nn1K∩C′n = 1K ·\nN′\nX\nn=1\nα′\nn1C′n = 1K ·\nN\nX\nn=1\nαn1Cn =\nN\nX\nn=1\nαn1K∩Cn\nby (18).\nIn the following proposition, we list the basic properties of this product.\nProposition 5.2. For fixed K ∈Kd,\n(i) (φ, ψ) 7→(φ · ψ)(K) is a bilinear map from Gd × Vd to R;\n(ii) (φ · ψ)(K) = (ψ · φ)(K) on Gd × Gd;\n(iii) (χ · ψ)(K) = ψ(K), where χ is the Euler characteristic.\nFor fixed φ ∈Gd and ψ ∈Vd,\n(iv) (φ · ψ)(·) is a σ-continuous valuation, that is, this operation acts from Gd × Vd into\nVd, moreover, (φ · ψ)({x}) = φ({x})ψ({x}) for each x ∈Rd;\n(v) if ψ ∈Gd, then φ · ψ ∈Gd as well, more precisely, if φ is defined by N, (αn), (Cn), and\nψ by N ′, (α′\nn), (C′\nn), then φ · ψ is defined by NN ′, (αnαm′ ), (Cn ∩Cm′ ).\nProof. (i) follows directly from (19). For\nφ = 1{· ∩C ̸= ∅}\nand\nψ = 1{· ∩C′ ̸= ∅},\n(20)\nwe have\n(φ · ψ)(K) = ψ(K ∩C) = 1{K ∩C ∩C′ ̸= ∅} = φ(K ∩C′) = (ψ · φ)(K).\n(21)\nThe general case of (ii) follows by linearity. Statement (iii) directly results from χ = 1{· ∩\nRd ̸= ∅}.\nFor (iv), if φ = 1{· ∩C ̸= ∅}, then (φ · ψ)(K) = ψ(K ∩C), which is a σ-continuous\nvaluation, then use linearity. The equality in (iv) follows from\n(φ · ψ)({x}) =\nN\nX\nn=1\nαnψ({x} ∩Cn) =\nN\nX\nn=1\nαn χ({x} ∩Cn)ψ({x}) = φ({x})ψ({x}).\nFor (v), under (20), the result follows from (21). In the general case, again use linearity.\n17\n\n\nThe valuation φ · ψ can be naturally called the product of φ and ψ for the following\nreason. The multiplication of smooth valuations introduced by S. Alesker [1] can be, in the\ntranslation-invariant case, succinctly described as follows. Let φ0 stand for the volume, and\ndefine φA = φ0(· + A), A ∈Kd, with + being the Minkowski addition. The Alesker product\nis defined by setting\n(φA · φB)(K) = φ0\n\u0000∆(K) + A × B\n\u0001\n,\nK ∈Kd,\n(22)\nwhere ∆: Rd →Rd × Rd stands for the diagonal embedding x 7→(x, x). This product then\nextends by linearity and continuity to all pairs of smooth translation-invariant valuations.\nExcept for the multiples of the Euler characteristic, countably generated valuations are\nneither smooth nor translation-invariant. Therefore, to use this approach, the basic valuation\nφ0 needs to be redefined. Let φ0 = 1{0 ∈·}. Then φA = φ0(· + A) = 1{· ∩(−A) ̸= ∅} for\nany (not necessarily bounded) nonempty closed convex set A. It follows from (22) that\n(φA · φB)(K) = 1\n\b\n∆(K) ∩\n\u0000(−A) × (−B)\n\u0001\n̸= ∅\n\t\n= 1{K ∩(−A) ∩(−B) ̸= ∅},\nK ∈Kd,\nwhich is consistent with the description of the product given in Proposition 5.2(v). This\nis in line with the intersectional approach to the Alesker product given in [4] within the\nframework of smooth manifolds.\n6\nOpen problems\nIn this section, we outline some open problems and conjectures.\nFirst, a major issue is\nto consider the case of general dimensions. This cannot be done by mimicking the proof\nof Theorem 3.2 due to the absence of a result relating m-convexity and polyconvexity in\ndimensions 3 and more.\nProblem 6.1. Characterize integer-valued monotone σ-continuous valuations in dimensions\n3 and higher.\nCounterexamples show that it is not possible to obtain meaningful results for valuations\nwhich are not σ-continuous. However, relaxing the monotonicity condition may be interesting\nalso in dimension 2.\nProblem 6.2. Obtain characterization results under weaker variants of the monotonicity\ncondition, e.g., assuming nonnegativity or local boundedness of variation in the sense of\nsup\nL⊂K, L∈Kd φ(L) ≤CK,\nK ∈Kd,\nwhere CK is a constant depending on K.\nProblem 6.3. Which property of an integer-valued monotone σ-continuous valuation φ ensu-\nres that its representation (7) contains no negative terms? This question can be posed in\ngeneral dimension, assuming that the representation (7) holds.\n18\n\n\nThe representation (7) can be interpreted as follows. Consider an integer-valued signed\nmeasure on the space of convex closed sets in R2 of the form\nµ =\nN+\nX\nn=1\nδC+\nn −\nN−\nX\nn=1\nδC−\nn ,\nwhere δC stands for the unit mass at C. By Remark 3.8, we may assume that this measure\nis defined only on K2. Then (7) can be written in the following integral form\nφ(K) =\nZ\nK2\nχ(K ∩C) µ(dC),\nK ∈K2.\nMore generally, by (17), any countably generated valuation on Kd can be written in the same\nform with µ = PN\nn=1 αnδCn for real numbers αn.\nWe call a measure µ on Kd (with its Borel σ-algebra generated by the Hausdorff metric)\nlocally finite if µ(CK) < ∞for all K ∈Kd, where CK = {C ∈Kd : K ∩C ̸= ∅}. An arbitrary\nlocally finite signed measure µ on Kd yields a valuation by letting\nφ(K) =\nZ\nKd\nχ(K ∩C) µ(dC) =\nZ\nKd 1{K ∩C ̸= ∅} µ(dC) = µ(CK).\n(23)\nSince CKn ↓CK as Kn ↓K, this valuation is σ-continuous due to the σ-additivity of the\nmeasure µ.\nProblem 6.4. Identify σ-continuous valuations on Kd such that (23) holds for a locally finite\nsigned measure µ on Kd? Note that, as follows from Example 3.3, such a measure need not\nbe unique.\nThe set of valuations admitting an integral representation of the form (23) is far from\nbeing limited to countably generated valuations. For instance, the d-dimensional volume can\nbe expressed in this form with a measure µ concentrated on singletons\nµ({x}: x ∈B) = λd(B),\nB ∈B(Rd),\nwhere λd stands for the d-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Similar representations hold for\nintrinsic volumes.\nWe conjecture that (23) holds for a very broad family of valuations. Examples 4.2 and 4.3\ndemonstrate that this does not hold for all σ-continuous valuations, since the families (C+\nn )\nand (C−\nn ) in these examples do not satisfy the local finiteness condition and so the measure\nµ is not locally finite. This may be explained by the lack of monotonicity in these valuations.\nProblem 6.5. Is the family of countably generated valuations dense (in some sense) in the\nspace of all σ-continuous valuations?\nThe following problems address changing the range of values and/or the definition domain\nof valuations.\nProblem 6.6. Characterize valuations taking values in other semigroups, such as (Z/nZ, +),\n(Z/nZ, ×), (Q, +), etc.\nProblem 6.7. Characterize integer-valued valuations on convex functions. It is very likely\nthat this can be done using our methods.\n19\n\n\nAcknowledgment\nAI was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, Grant No. 229505.\nTV was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, Grant No. 10001553.\nReferences\n[1] S.

{"text": "Multimodal Dreaming: A Global Workspace Approach to\nWorld Model-Based Reinforcement Learning\nL´eopold Mayti´e (leopold.maytie@univ-tlse3.fr)\nCerCo, CNRS UMR5549\nArtificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute\nUniversit´e de Toulouse\nRoland Bertin Johannet (roland.bertin-johannet@cnrs.fr)\nCerCo, CNRS UMR5549\nUniversit´e de Toulouse\nRufin VanRullen (rufin.vanrullen@cnrs.fr)\nCerCo, CNRS UMR5549\nArtificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute\nUniversit´e de Toulouse\nAbstract\nHumans leverage rich internal models of the world to\nreason about the future, imagine counterfactuals, and\nadapt flexibly to new situations. In Reinforcement Learn-\ning (RL), world models aim to capture how the envi-\nronment evolves in response to the agent’s actions, fa-\ncilitating planning and generalization. However, typical\nworld models directly operate on the environment vari-\nables (e.g. pixels, physical attributes), which can make\ntheir training slow and cumbersome; instead, it may be\nadvantageous to rely on high-level latent dimensions that\ncapture relevant multimodal variables. Global Workspace\n(GW) Theory offers a cognitive framework for multimodal\nintegration and information broadcasting in the brain, and\nrecent studies have begun to introduce efficient deep\nlearning implementations of GW. Here, we evaluate the\ncapabilities of an RL system combining GW with a world\nmodel. We compare our GW-Dreamer with various ver-\nsions of the standard PPO and the original Dreamer algo-\nrithms. We show that performing the dreaming process\n(i.e., mental simulation) inside the GW latent space allows\nfor training with fewer environment steps.\nAs an addi-\ntional emergent property, the resulting model (but not its\ncomparison baselines) displays strong robustness to the\nabsence of one of its observation modalities (images or\nsimulation attributes). We conclude that the combination\nof GW with World Models holds great potential for improv-\ning decision-making in RL agents.\nKeywords:\nWorld Models; Global Workspace Theory; Re-\ninforcement Learning; Multimodal Representation Learning;\nMental Simulation\nIntroduction\nHumans possess the ability to anticipate the consequences\nof their actions before executing them in the real world. This\ncapacity suggests that humans construct an internal World\nModel (see e.g. Friston (2010); Clark (2013), among others).\nIn artificial intelligence (AI), this concept has been partic-\nularly applied in World Model-based reinforcement learning\n(RL), a subset of model-based RL. In model-based RL, tran-\nsition dynamics of the environment are traditionally specified\nas Markov decision processes (MDPs), either manually de-\nfined (Sutton, 1991; Atkeson & Santamaria, 1997) or empir-\nically estimated from interaction data (Dearden et al., n.d.;\nSzita & Szepesv´ari, n.d.). While model-based RL is generally\nmore sample-efficient than model-free RL, constructing accu-\nrate transition models remains challenging. Learning a World\nModel directly from data facilitates decision-making in environ-\nments where transition dynamics are either unknown or too\ncomplex to specify explicitly. This idea was popularized by\nHa & Schmidhuber (2018) and later extended by the Dreamer\nframework (Hafner et al., 2024), allowing agents to learn by\nperforming mental simulations of episodes rather than relying\nsolely on direct interaction with the environment.\nMore generally, AI research on world models has gained\nfurther momentum with the advent of large-scale World Foun-\ndation Models, such as Genie (Bruce et al., 2024) trained in an\nunsupervised manner, or World Foundation Models platforms\nlike Cosmos from Nvidia (NVIDIA et al., 2025)\nBeyond their ability to anticipate the consequences of their\nactions, humans perceive the world through multiple sensory\nmodalities, leading to a rich and robust representation of their\nenvironment.\nThe Global Workspace Theory (GWT), intro-\nduced by Baars (1988) and later expanded by Dehaene et al.\n(1998), provides a framework to explain such integrative cog-\nnitive processes. According to this theory, specialized mod-\nules compete to encode their information into a shared space\ncalled the Global Workspace. Through a broadcasting mech-\nanism, this information becomes accessible to various brain\nregions, shaping our conscious experience.\nTheoretical proposals have linked World Models and Global\nWorkspace Theory (GWT). VanRullen & Kanai (2021) align\nclosely with GWT, suggesting a World Model module that in-\nteracts with a shared representational space. Similarly, the\nIntegrated World Model Theory (IWMT) Safron (2022) seeks\narXiv:2502.21142v1  [cs.AI]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\nto unify these concepts by incorporating predictive and gen-\nerative mechanisms for structuring internal representations.\nWhile both emphasize information integration, GWT focuses\non selective broadcasting for decision-making and awareness,\nwhereas IWMT prioritizes constructing an internal model for\nprediction and planning. Inspired by these frameworks, our\nwork explores multimodal integration and predictive mecha-\nnisms without committing to (or rejecting) their assumptions\nabout consciousness.\nIn this paper we introduce a system bridging the ideas\nof World Model and Global Workspace (VanRullen & Kanai,\n2021; Safron, 2022). We took inspiration from the architecture\nproposed in Dreamer algorithms (Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018;\nHafner et al., 2024) and extended the Global Workspace im-\nplementation proposed by Devillers et al. (2024) to implement\nour Global Workspace Dreamer (GW-Dreamer). The key orig-\ninality of GW-Dreamer is that it learns to represent the World-\nModel transitions using multimodal GW representations. We\ncompared our model in two different Reinforcement Learning\nenvironments against standard PPO and the original Dreamer\nalgorithm as well as a variant of Dreamer that shared the\nsame visual input module as GW-Dreamer. Thanks to its ef-\nficient GW multimodal latent representation, our model learns\nwith fewer environment interactions; in addition, it proves more\nrobust to missing modalities (as already shown in the context\nof model-free RL by Mayti´e et al. (2024)).\nModel\nIn this study, we consider RL environments with multimodal\nobservations. By consequence, the state of an environment\nat time t leads to multiple observations ot ∈O, which can be\neither an RGB image ov\nt , or an attribute vector oattr\nt\ndescribing\nphysical attributes of the simulation. From these observations,\nthe agent predicts an action at ∈A to interact with the envi-\nronment, leading to a reward rt+1.\nTo interact with these multimodal environments we propose\na model composed of three main components: a representa-\ntion model, called Global Workspace, a World Model and an\nActor-Critic RL policy. The training process consists of two\nmain steps. First, the Global Workspace is trained to repre-\nsent the multimodal environment using a dataset of environ-\nment observations collected randomly or via an expert agent\n(Figures 1,2). Then, the World Model and the Actor-Critic are\ntrained through interaction with the environment (Figure 3). In\nthe following subparts, we provide a detailed description of the\narchitecture and training procedure for each component.\nGlobal Workspace\nThe Global Workspace serves as a representation model,\nencoding multiple modalities into a unified latent representa-\ntion.\nThis latent representation is then used by the World\nModel to encapsulate the agent’s perception of the environ-\nment at time t. Our proposed Global Workspace is inspired by\nthe approach introduced by Devillers et al. (2024). However,\nwe modify both the architecture and training procedure to pro-\nduce a single unified representation, rather than maintaining\nseparate representations for each modality. This architecture\nand its training losses are illustrated in Figure 1.\nAs proposed by VanRullen & Kanai (2021) and imple-\nmented by Devillers et al. (2024), we do not train our set of\nencoders and decoders directly from raw modalities. Instead,\nwe employ two pretrained and frozen modules (in this case,\nVAEs) to transform raw representations (denoted ov for im-\nages and oattr for attributes) into unimodal latent represen-\ntations (uv and uattr).\nThese unimodal representations are\nthen encoded into pre-fusion latent variables zv = ev(uv) and\nzattr = eattr(uattr). However, in contrast to the model proposed\nby Devillers, we do not always directly decode from these pre-\nfusion representations. We combine them using element-wise\nweighted sum followed by a Tanh activation function to form a\nunified representation denoted z. From this unified represen-\ntation, we can recover the unimodal representations through\na set of decoders dv and dattr.\nThe GW model is trained using two loss functions: the con-\ntrastive loss and the broadcast loss.\nThe contrastive loss\nLcont follows a similar formulation to the one proposed in CLIP\n(Radford et al., 2021); it is designed to align the representa-\ntions zv and zattr before fusion, supporting the development of\namodal representations in the Global Workspace. The broad-\ncast loss is inspired by the broadcast principle at the heart of\nGWT; it is computed by comparing the predicted ( ˆuv, ˆuattr)\nand ground-truth unimodal representations (uv, uattr) using\nthe mean squared error (MSE). Specifically, it consists of a\nweighted sum of multiple sub-losses, including the cycle loss\n(Lcy), demi-cycle loss (Ldcy), and translation loss (Ltr), as\nintroduced by Devillers et al. (2024).\nAdditionally, a fusion\nloss (Lfusion) is incorporated. The primary objective of these\nlosses is to ensure that the unimodal latent vectors can be ac-\ncurately reconstructed after the weighted-sum fusion of pre-\nGlobal Workspace representations (zv and zattr), regardless\nof the exact fusion weights employed. The weighting factors\nαattr and αv are adjusted for each specific sub-loss (and with\nthe constraints αv ≥0,αattr ≥0,αv + αattr = 1), as defined\nbelow. (For an in-depth discussion of the usefulness of each\nloss term Lcont, Lcy, Ldcy and Ltr, see Devillers et al. (2024)).\n∀(x,y) ∈{attr,v},\nx ̸= y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLdcy = ∥dx(tanh(ex(ux)))−ux∥2\n2,\n(αx=1,αy=0)\nLcy = ∥dx(tanh(ey(dy(tanh(ex(ux))))))−ux∥2\n2,\n(αx=1,αy=0), then (αx=0,αy=1)\nLtr = ∥dy(tanh(ex(ux)))−uy∥2\n2,\n(αx=1,αy=0)\nLfusion = ∥dx(tanh(αx.ex(ux)+αy.ey(uy)))−ux∥2\n2,\n(αx>0,αy>0,αx+αy=1)\n(1)\nLbroad = βdcy.Ldcy +βcy.Lcy +βtr.Ltr +βfusion.Lfusion\n(2)\n\n\nov\noattr\nGW\nz\ndv\ndattr\nev\neattr\nuattr\nûv\nuv\nzv\nzattr\nûattr\nαv\nαattr\nVAE\nVAE\nLcont\n[0 1 0]\n8\n8\n...\n6\nFigure 1: Overview of the Global Workspace model for multimodal representation. Raw environment inputs (image pixels, simu-\nlation attributes) are encoded in their latent unimodal representation (uv or uattr) thanks to pretrained (and frozen) VAEs. These\nunimodal latent representations are then processed by encoders ev and eattr (respectively) to produce pre-GW representations\n(zv and zattr). The final Global Workspace representation z ∈Z is obtained by fusing these pre-GW representations through an\nelement-wise weighted sum (with weights αv ≥0 and αattr ≥0, αv + αattr = 1) followed by a Tanh activation. The unimodal\nlatent vectors can be retrieved from z with a set of decoders dv and dattr. The GW component networks ev, eattr, dv and dattr\nare trained by combining a contrastive loss Lcont and a broadcast Lbroad. The former encourages the pre-GW representations\nto align across modalities; the latter also promotes this objective (see Devillers et al. (2024)), and ensures that decoded or\n“broadcasted” GW representations resemble the original unimodal latent representations, regardless of each modality’s initial\ncontribution to the GW representation (as captured by the fusion weights αv and αattr). Once trained, the GW model is frozen\nfor learning the World Model and RL policy (Figure 3), and the fusion weights are fixed (αv = αattr = 0.5).\nThe full training objective of the Global Workspace is a\nweighted sum of the contrastive loss and the broadcast loss,\nas shown below. The weight of the broadcast loss is fixed at\none (its overall contribution can be adjusted by modifying the\nindividual weights that constitute it: βdcy,βcy,βtr,β fusion).\nLGW = βcont.Lcont +Lbroad\n(3)\nFigure 2 illustrates the functional properties of the trained\nGW when processing multimodal inputs. Here, for illustration\npurposes, two images (left) are chosen to differ from the at-\ntributes vector (right) along the color and size dimensions. By\nmodulating the fusion coefficients αv and αattr, the GW can\nperform distinct functional operations. For instance, it can per-\nform attribute-to-image translation by setting the fusion coef-\nficient to αv = 0 and αattr = 1. This configuration ensures\nthat only the attributes representation propagates through the\nGW, while visual information is disregarded. The following de-\ncoding step (using dv and the visual VAE), reconstructs an\nimage that is inferred purely from the attribute representation.\nThe results, shown above the ”tr” label in Figure 2, confirm\nthat the reconstructed image remains unaffected by the sup-\npressed visual input. A second operational mode, referred to\nas a demi-cycle, is illustrated in the “dcy” section of Figure\n2. Here, the GW selectively propagates only the visual repre-\nsentation by setting αv = 1 and αattr = 0. The reconstructed\nimages exclusively reflect the visual inputs. Beyond unimodal\nprocessing, the GW also supports multimodal fusion, enabling\nthe integration of heterogeneous information streams. In the\n”fusion” section of Figure 2, both modalities are encoded into\nthe GW with equal weighting (αv = 0.5,αattr = 0.5), allow-\ning information from both sources to be jointly encoded in the\nshared latent space. Decoding this fused representation re-\nsults in an image that integrates features from both the orig-\ninal visual input and attributes: the reconstructed color and\nsize are halfway between those of the attributes and image in-\nputs. Thus, by appropriately tuning the fusion coefficients fol-\nlowing encoding (ev,eattr) and by selecting the appropriate de-\ncoding pathway (dv or dattr), one can dynamically reconfigure\nthe functional role of the GW. Specifically, it can transition be-\ntween unimodal reconstruction, cross-modal translation, and\nmultimodal fusion, providing a flexible framework for integrat-\ning and transforming heterogeneous information sources.\nWorld Model\nThe World Model (WM) is a fundamental component that\nenables to train the RL agent through a mental simulation or\n“dreaming” process. At each time step t, this recurrent net-\nwork (with internal hidden state ht) receives as input the GW\nrepresentation (zt) and an action at, from which it predicts the\n\n\nshape\nposition\nangle\nsize\n(R,G,B)\nvalues\nattributes\n[0, 1, 0]\n[10, 15]\n2.10\n7\n(243,57,82)\nαv \n1\nαattr\n0\ndcy\nαv \n0\nαattr\n1\ntr\nz\nev\neattr\ndv\nVAE\nVAE\nfusion\nαv \nαattr\n0.5\n0.5\nFigure 2: Illustration of the behaviour of the GW. We start from a fixed attribute vector describing a small red egg-shape (top\nright), and two images (top left) that are chosen to differ in terms of color (right-most image) or both color and size (left-most\nimage). These inputs are encoded into the GW using different fusion weights αv and αattr, indicated in green below each\nconfiguration, and subsequently decoded into an image. The resulting images at the bottom illustrate three distinct functional\nmodes of operation. In the translation mode (tr, bottom right), both modalities are encoded, but only attribute information is\ntransmitted through the GW, while visual input is disregarded. The reconstructed images, obtained by decoding the GW latent\nvector z as an image using dv and the visual VAE, demonstrate the successful translation of attribute information into the visual\ndomain. In the demi-cycle mode (dcy, bottom left), both modalities are encoded, but only the visual information is propagated\nthrough the GW. The absence of distortions due to attributes information in the reconstructed images confirms that attribute\ninformation was effectively suppressed. In the fusion mode (bottom middle), both modalities are encoded with equal weights,\nallowing information from both sources to be integrated inside the GW. The decoded images reflect a hybrid representation of\nvision and attributes features, resulting in an intermediate color and size.\nGW representation at the next time step (zt+1), the reward\nassociated with the action (rt+1), and a Boolean termination\nsignal (dt+1) indicating whether the task is complete.\nThe\nGW representation is computed from environmental observa-\ntions using the pre-trained (and frozen) GW model described\nabove. The model employs a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\n(Cho et al., 2014) for recurrence, while the prediction heads\nconsist of a set of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs).\nThe World Model is trained on data collected from the en-\nvironment using the current policy of the Actor (see below),\nwhile keeping the GW model frozen. Its objective is to predict\nthe GW representation, reward, and termination flag at the\nnext time step (t+1). The corresponding loss function (LWM)\nis computed as a weighted sum, combining MSE for the pre-\ndicted GW representation and reward, with Binary Cross-\nEntropy (BCE) for the termination flag. This is illustrated in\nFigure 3 (1).\nActor-Critic\nThe Actor policy is learned concurrently with the World\nModel in alternating steps, as detailed below. Initially, n data\npairs (ot, at, ot+1, rt+1, dt+1) are collected through interaction\nwith the environment and stored in a replay buffer. Once the\ndata is gathered, m learning steps are performed. The learn-\ning alternates between training the World Model as described\npreviously and the Actor-Critic network. The Actor-Critic takes\nas input the internal representation from the GRU, ht, and pre-\ndicts both the action at and the state value vt. This approach\nclosely follows the methodology proposed in Dreamer (Hafner\net al., 2024). It learns from ”mental simulations” or ”dreaming”\ninstead of interacting directly with the environment.\nDuring\ntraining, the observations are provided only at the first step.\nFor the following ones, the World Model simulates the environ-\nment for a predetermined number of steps, using the actions\npredicted by the Actor, without access to true observations,\nas shown in Figure 3 (2). During AC training, the gradient\ndoes not propagate through the World Model, ensuring that\nthe learned policy does not directly influence the internal dy-\nnamics of the World Model (and vice-versa, WM training gra-\ndients do not propagate to the AC network). The simulated ac-\ntions and values, along with the predicted rewards and done\nsignals, are used in the loss function of the Actor-Critic net-\nwork (following the standard Actor-Critic algorithm (Konda &\nTsitsiklis, 1999) modified in Dreamer (Hafner et al., 2024)).\nThis entire training procedure is described explicitly in Algo-\nrithm 1.\n\n\n(1) World Model training\n(2) Actor Critic training\nzt\nẑt+1\nAC\nat+1\nvt+1\nWM\nht\nht+1\nWM\nAC\nat\nvt\nẑt+2\nov\nt\noattr\nt\nGW\nVAE\nVAE\nzt\nat\nẑt+1\nat+1\nzt+1\nrt+1\ndt+1\nWM\nht\nht+1\nWM\nov\nt\nrt+1\n^\ndt+1\n^\noattr\nt\nov\nt+1\noattr\nt+1\nLWM\nGW\nVAE\nVAE\nGW\nVAE\nVAE\n(\n(\n(\n(\nFigure 3: (1) World Model training: At each time step, the environment provides observations (ov\nt , oattr\nt\n), a reward rt, and a\ntermination signal dt. A pretrained and frozen Global Workspace (GW) model, incorporating a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)\nfor each modality, encodes observations into a GW representation zt. The WM is trained on sequences of data collected from\nthe environment using the current AC policy. Given zt and the action at predicted by the policy, the WM (implemented as a\nGRU: Gated Recurrent Unit) updates its internal state from ht to ht+1. Using this updated state, the WM predicts the next\nGW representation zt+1, the expected reward rt+1, and the termination signal dt+1 with three separate prediction heads. The\nloss function LWM is computed as a weighted sum of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for zt+1 and rt+1, and the Binary Cross-\nEntropy (BCE) loss for predicting dt+1. (2) Actor-Critic training: The AC model is trained using ”mental simulation”. The GW\nrepresentation zt derived from observations is provided only at the first time step. For subsequent steps, the WM generates\nnovel states by processing the previously predicted GW representation and the action selected by the AC. The AC loss functions\nare computed exclusively from the predicted elements within the simulated trajectory, including the generated termination signal\nˆd, reward ˆr, and actions taken based on the latent state h.\nSimple Shapes Environment\nThe different models were tested in an environment called\n‘Simple Shapes’. This environment was introduced in Dev-\nillers et al. (2024) as a fixed dataset, and in\nMayti´e et al.\n(2024) as an RL environment.\nThe Simple Shapes environment is multimodal, the agent\ncan receive two types of observations: 32×32 pixel RGB im-\nages of a 2D shape on a black background, or a set of eight at-\ntributes directly describing the environment’s state (Figure 4).\nThere are three different types of shapes, an egg-like shape,\nan isosceles triangle, and a diamond. The shapes possess\ndifferent properties: a size s ∈[smin,smax], a position (x,y) ∈\n[ smax\n2 ,32 −smax\n2 [2, a rotation θ ∈[0,2π[ and an HSL color\n(ch,cs,cl) ∈[0,1]2 × [lmin,1].\nThe agent does not observe\nthese properties directly, but instead receives transformed at-\ntributes as observations: the rotation angle θ is decomposed\ninto (cθ,sθ) = (cos(θ),sin(θ)); HSL colors are translated to\nthe RGB domain, finally, the shape variable is expressed as a\none-hot vector of size three, and all variables are normalized\nbetween -1 and 1.\nAt the beginning of each episode, attributes are randomly\nsampled within their respective domains; the starting point is\nthus a random shape of a random orientation, located some-\nwhere in the image. The agent’s goal is to move the shape to\nthe center of the image and align it to point to the top. For this\npurpose, six different actions are available to the agent: mov-\ning the shape by one pixel in cardinal directions (left, right, up,\nor down) and rotating the shape by an angle of π\n32 clockwise\nor anti-clockwise. The reward is initialized at zero. At each\ntimestep, the reward is equal to minus the current distance\n(in pixels) between the shape’s position and the image center\nminus the smallest angle (in radians) between the shape’s ori-\nentation and the null angle times a rotation reward coefficient\nequal to 10 by default. The episode ends when the shape\nreaches the goal state, with no additional reward.\nResults\nWe evaluated the performance of the GW-Dreamer model\nagainst different PPO and Dreamer variants. GW and VAE\ncomponents were identical across all models and were pre-\ntrained using data randomly sampled from the environment.\nSpecifically, we trained: (1) a standard PPO model using only\nvisual inputs (ov), (2) a ”VAE-PPO” that uses concatenated\nrepresentations from both attribute and image VAEs, and (3)\na ”GW-PPO” that employs a single input representation com-\ning from the GW. This model is expected to have certain ad-\nvantages relative to the previous two baselines, owing to its\nstrong multimodal abilities (as shown by Mayti´e et al. (2024)),\n\n\nAlgorithm 1 GW-Dreamer Training Procedure\n1: Require Pretrained Global Workspace (GW)\n2: Initialize World Model (WM), Actor-Critic (AC), Replay\nBuffer\n3: while not max number environment steps do\n4:\nCollect n transitions (ot,at,ot+1,rt+1,dt+1) from the\nenvironment and store in Replay Buffer\n5:\nfor m training steps do\n6:\nTrain World Model:\n7:\nTransform Replay Buffer observations (ov\nt ,oattr\nt\n)\ninto GW latent vectors (zt)\n8:\nPredict next GW representation, reward and\ndone signal: WM(zt,at) = ( ˆdt+1, ˆrt+1, ˆzt+1)\n9:\nCompute\nLWM\nby\ncomparing\nagainst\n(dt+1,rt+1,zt+1)\n10:\nUpdate WM by backpropagating LWM\n11:\nTrain Actor-Critic:\n12:\nEncode the first observation through GW to get\nlatent representation zt\n13:\nGenerate imagined trajectories using WM and\nthe actions predicted by AC\n14:\nUpdate AC using simulated rewards and transi-\ntions\n15:\nend for\n16: end while\nActions :\nPlace shape at the center pointing to the top\nGoal :\nshape\nposition\nangle\nsize\n(R,G,B)\nvalues\nattributes\n[1, 0, 0]\n[4, 11]\n1.25\n9\n(220,12,20)\nFigure 4: Illustration of the Simple Shapes environment and\nthe task used in this study.\nThe figure presents examples\nof raw observations, including four example images (left) and\none example set of attributes (right). The agent’s goal is to\nplace the shape at the center and pointing upward. The agent\ncan move the shape one pixel at a time in four directions (up,\ndown, left, right) or rotate it clockwise or counterclockwise.\nbut it does not include a World Model. Additionally, we trained\n(4) the standard Dreamer algorithm using both attribute and\nimage modalities and (5) a ”VAE-Dreamer” model that re-\nceives VAE-based representations of attributes and images\nas inputs. The motivation for incorporating latent representa-\ntions (VAEs) was to enable the models to operate in a fully\nlatent space, reducing the high compute associated with re-\nconstructing images through decoders. At the same time, this\nmade the underlying architecture closer to GW-Dreamer, ex-\ncept for the absence of a Global Workspace.\nAll models were trained in the Simple Shapes environment,\nand the results are illustrated in Figure 5. Returns (cumulative\nsum of rewards) were normalized such that a return of zero\ncorresponds to the performance of a random agent.\nAddi-\ntionally, a “return criterion” was defined as 75% of the highest\nsmoothed reward obtained by any of the models in the figure.\nWe verified visually that this criterion corresponds to a level of\nreturn at which the task begins to be solved efficiently.\nFigure 5 presents several key findings. First, when com-\nparing different PPO variants, we observe that both mul-\ntimodal PPO models (VAE-PPO and GW-PPO) reach the\nreturn criterion significantly earlier than the standard PPO\nmodel. While the standard PPO model meets the criterion\njust before 1,000,000 steps, VAE-PPO reaches it at 400,000\nsteps, and GW-PPO at only 200,000 steps. This suggests that\nincorporating multimodal latent representations can greatly\naccelerate policy learning, with GW representations yielding\neven faster convergence than VAE representations.\nSecond, when comparing Dreamer-based models to PPO-\nbased ones, Dreamer models generally reach the return cri-\nterion earlier, corroborating previous findings that world mod-\nels improve sample efficiency Hafner et al. (2024). In addi-\ntion, GW-PPO exhibits sample efficiency comparable to both\nstandard Dreamer and VAE-Dreamer, with all three models\nreaching the threshold at approximately 200,000 environment\nsteps. This suggests that a strong multimodal representation\n(GW) can bring as much to the model’s efficiency as a World\nModel could. Can the two advantages (GW and World Model)\nbe combined to yield an even more efficient architecture?\nThis is what Figure 5 seems to suggest: the GW-Dreamer\nmodel outperforms all other models, reaching the criterion\nin just 20,000 steps, i.e.\nabout 10X faster than standard\nDreamer and VAE-Dreamer.\nSince both GW-Dreamer and\nVAE-Dreamer operate in a multimodal latent space, this result\ndirectly highlights the effectiveness of the GW representation\nin improving sample efficiency within a world-model frame-\nwork. These findings suggest that the GW representation en-\nables more efficient learning when combined with a dreaming-\nbased approach.\nOne advantage of training a policy from two input modali-\nties (images and attributes) is that the resulting agent could\nprove particularly robust in conditions where one of the two\nmodalities becomes noisy or unreliable. We thus conducted\nan additional experiment to evaluate the zero-shot robustness\nof GW-Dreamer compared to other multimodal variants when\none sensory modality is removed.\nThis scenario simulates\nreal-world conditions where a robot may experience sensor\nfailure or a human may lose one of their senses. Once the\nmodels were trained, their parameters were frozen, and we\nsystematically removed either the attribute or image inputs.\nFor models using a GW representation, the fusion mecha-\n\n\n104\n105\n106\nEnvironment Steps\n1500\n1000\n500\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\nSmoothed Return\nPPO\nVAE-PPO\nGW-PPO\nDreamer\nVAE-Dreamer\nGW-Dreamer\nreturn criterion\nFigure 5: Performance (cumulative sum of rewards or “return”) as a function of the number of environment steps (log scale)\nduring training. A fixed baseline, corresponding to the performance of a fully random policy, was subtracted from the episode\nreturns. Thus, a random policy’s performance is equal to zero. The returns are smoothed using a sliding window of length 10,\nwith the shaded region indicating the standard error of the mean over this window. The return criterion is defined as 75% of the\nmaximum smoothed return. It corresponds (as verified visually) to a performance at which the task starts to be solved properly.\nnism was adjusted accordingly: if attributes were removed, full\nweight was assigned to the visual modality (αv = 1,αattr = 0),\nand conversely, if vision was removed the opposite adjustment\nwas made (αv = 0,αattr = 1).\nThe results, shown in Figure 6, reveal a striking contrast in\nthe robustness of the models. Models using other represen-\ntations than a GW (VAE-PPO, VAE-Dreamer and Dreamer)\nshowed a complete performance collapse when a modality\nwas removed, indicating a strong dependence on both sen-\nsory inputs. In contrast, models using a GW representation\n(GW-PPO and GW-Dreamer) were the only models to main-\ntain performance above the return criterion and remaining\nclose to their original performances. This demonstrates that\nGW-Dreamer is capable of solving the task even when one\nmodality is missing, highlighting the importance of a multi-\nmodal representation like GW that effectively integrates dif-\nferent sensory inputs.\n(GW-PPO also benefited from this\nGW representation, but was less sample-efficient than GW-\nDreamer).\nThese findings underscore the advantages of combining\nthe Global Workspace framework with a World Model.\nBy\nleveraging this integration, RL algorithms can be trained effi-\nciently while maintaining robustness to modality perturbations,\nmaking them more suitable for real-world applications where\nsensory failures may occur.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThis paper represents a first step in bridging Global\nWorkspace Theory and World Models in AI. It builds upon\nthe architecture proposed by VanRullen & Kanai (2021) and\nimplemented by Devillers et al. (2024), adapting it to be com-\npatible with World-Model-based reinforcement learning algo-\nrithms such as Dreamer (Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018; Hafner et\nal., 2024).\nHowever, some limitations remain. In terms of absolute per-\nformance (measured by return), GW-Dreamer slightly under-\nperforms compared to the original Dreamer algorithm. This\ndifference is somewhat offset, of course, by the improved\nsample-efficiency and robustness of GW-Dreamer. Addition-\nally, this study relied on a pre-trained GW model trained on\nrandomly sampled data, which may not always be represen-\ntative of an agent’s environment. In more complex environ-\nments, expert-collected data would likely be necessary to en-\nsure sufficient coverage of states that are difficult to reach by\nchance.\nAn alternative approach could involve training the\nGW representation jointly with the rest of the model.

Performance\nvalues are averaged over 10 trials, with error bars representing the standard error of the mean.\never, the GW itself requires pre-trained latent representations\nas inputs (VanRullen & Kanai, 2021), modeled here as a VAE;\npre-training this latent input space would still potentially lead\nto the same challenge of appropriate environment sampling,\neven if the GW itself was trained jointly with the World Model\nand Actor-Critic components. One way of solving this problem\ncould be to either use a pretrained foundation model capable\nof encoding arbitrary images in a latent space (Oquab et al.,\n2023) or to create our own “foundation” encoder trained on\nlarge-scale open datasets that have already been collected,\ne.g. in robotics (Walke et al., 2023; Collaboration et al., 2024)\nAnother limitation of the present study is that the advan-\ntages of GW-Dreamer were demonstrated here in a single,\nrelatively simple test environment. An important direction for\nfuture work will be to evaluate the model in more complex sce-\nnarios, such as robotic environments.\nDespite these limitations, this study demonstrates the ad-\nvantages of integrating GWT and WM. This combination sig-\nnificantly improves training efficiency in RL, allowing GW-\nDreamer to learn with about 10 times fewer environment\nsteps. This accelerated training is not due to operating entirely\nin a latent space, as GW-Dreamer also surpasses (in terms of\nsample efficiency) a Dreamer variant that relies on latent VAE\nrepresentations.\nFurthermore, GW-Dreamer displays zero-\nshot robustness to modality loss. Unlike the original Dreamer,\nGW-Dreamer maintains its performance even when visual in-\nputs or attribute information are removed (similarly to findings\nobtained for model-free RL algorithms in Mayti´e et al. (2024),\nand corroborated here with our GW-PPO variant).\nThe findings have potential implications in cognitive neuro-\nscience as a practical test of GWT. First, compared with exist-\ning approaches (Radford et al., 2021; Hafner et al., 2024), the\nGW tends to produce a superior multimodal representation,\nowing to its semi-supervised training procedure inspired by\nthe “broadcast” principle (Baars, 1988). This fact was already\nsuggested by a number of recent studies (Devillers et al.,\n2021, 2024; Mayti´e et al., 2024), and is confirmed here in the\ncontext of model-based RL. Second, we show that GW mul-\ntimodal representations can be leveraged by a World Model\nto produce mental simulations that help the system converge\nto an optimal decision strategy. This resembles “dreaming” in\nhumans and animals, and more generally, captures the ability\nof such biological systems to imagine the potential outcome\nof a planned sequence of actions before making a decision.\n\n\nWhile this evidently does not suffice to entirely validate GWT,\nit confirms its potential relevance as a theory of higher-level\ncognition.\nUltimately, this research tackles key challenges in RL, such\nas the large amount of environment interactions required for\npolicy training and the need for strong multimodal representa-\ntions, particularly in robotics. It opens the way for future work\nto further integrate GWT and World Models.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by an ANITI Chair (ANR grant\nANR-19-PI3A-004), an ANR grant COCOBOT (ANR21-FAI2-\n0005) and by “D´efi Cl´e Robotique centr´ee sur l’humain”\nfunded by R´egion Occitanie, France.

In this\nwork, we address these shortcomings by shifting the focus from uncertainty in the weight\nspace to uncertainty at the activation level, via Gaussian processes. More specifically, we\nintroduce the Gaussian Process Activation function (GAPA) to capture neuron-level un-\ncertainties. Our approach operates in a post-hoc manner, preserving the original mean\npredictions of the pre-trained neural network and thereby avoiding the underfitting issues\ncommonly encountered in previous methods. We propose two methods. The first, GAPA-\nFree, employs empirical kernel learning from the training data for the hyperparameters\nand is highly efficient during training. The second, GAPA-Variational, learns the hyperpa-\nrameters via gradient descent on the kernels, thus affording greater flexibility. Empirical\nresults demonstrate that GAPA-Variational outperforms the Laplace approximation on\nmost datasets in at least one of the uncertainty quantification metrics.\n1. Introduction\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range\nof pattern recognition tasks (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Kenton and Toutanova, 2019; Mnih\net al., 2015; Hinton et al., 2012; Litjens et al., 2017). However, traditional DNNs do not\nquantify epistemic uncertainty, limiting their reliability in risk-sensitive applications such\nas autonomous driving (Shafaei et al., 2018), healthcare (Begoli et al., 2019), and finance\n(Blasco et al., 2024). To address this limitation, numerous surrogate methods have been\ndeveloped for downstream decision-making under uncertainty, particularly for anomaly de-\ntection and out-of-distribution detection (Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023). Yet, a more\nprincipled Bayesian approach has been proposed to model uncertainty directly. This has\nled to methods that approximate distributions over weight space, including Bayesian Neural\n© R.

Illustration based on a toy regression problem from (Ortega et al., 2023).\nNetworks (Neal, 2012), deep ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017), and Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo methods. Additionally, regularization-based methods such as Dropout (Gal and\nGhahramani, 2016) and SWAG (Maddox et al., 2019), as well as explicit modeling of weight\nuncertainty (Blundell et al., 2015), have shown promise in improving uncertainty estimates\nin deep learning models. However, there are many challenges that hinder the widespread\napplications of Bayesian modelling: In general, these methods are computationally expen-\nsive or even intractable in practice, for instance requiring the training of multiple DNNs\nor learning a distribution over each weight (Graves, 2011; Hernández-Lobato and Adams,\n2015).\nWith the rise of large pre-trained models in many domains like computer vision\nand natural language, the need to incorporate uncertainty-aware methods already during\nthe model training phase is another limiting factor in their applications (Fort et al., 2019;\nIzmailov et al., 2021). Even methods, such as Monte-Carlo dropout, which may be present\nduring training to act as a regularizer, require multiple forward passes to generate samples\n(Gal and Ghahramani, 2016; Neal, 2012; Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017). In addition, many\nBayesian methods tend to suffer from underfitting, because uncertainty modelling is often\ninherently linked to regularization (mostly via the prior) (Wenzel et al., 2020; Osawa et al.,\n2019). Recently, Laplace approximations have become popular, arguably because they can\nbe applied as a post-processing method to a pre-trained neural network without affecting its\nprediction and empirically capture uncertainty well without requiring sampling. Neverthe-\nless, they demand the calculation of the Jacobian, which is computationally intensive. In\naddition, for scalability reasons, they are typically only employed in the last layer of a model,\nwhich potentially hinders their flexibility (Daxberger et al., 2021; Ortega et al., 2023).\nIn this work, we approach this problem from a different perspective: What if we shift\nour focus from uncertainty in the weight space to uncertainty in the activa-\ntions? Specifically, we model uncertainty at each neuron’s postactivation by fitting a one-\ndimensional Gaussian process to each neuron in the first layer. This approach is inexpensive\nto fit, and can be applied to pre-trained neural networks, without the need of re-training\nor fine-tuning. The second key ingredient is to propagate the obtained a uncetainties at\nthe GP-infused layer (GAPA) through the network using deterministic propagation rules\nakin to determistic variational inference (Wu et al., 2018). Unlike Laplace approximation\nthis combination allows us to model uncertainty at any layer of the network. The method\nis purely post-hoc (it only needs access to the pre-trained model and some training data),\ndoes not require fine-tuning of the model, and, unlike for instance dropout, can express\nuncertainty in a single forward-pass. Importantly, infusing uncertainty in this way does not\n2\n\n\nPost-Hoc Uncertainty Quantification in Pre-Trained Neural Networks via Activation-Level Gaussian P\nchange the original prediction of the pre-trained model in any way, thereby preserving the\nmodels predictive quality.\nSpecifically, we propose two Gaussian Process Activation function (GAPA) methods.\nThe first, GAPA-Free, is a cost-effective approach that employs empirical kernel methods\nto compute the hyperparameters of the Gaussian process. The second, GAPA-Variational,\nuses variational inducing points to learn the hyperparameters, thereby allowing for greater\nflexibility. Our contributions are as follows:\n• A post-hoc method for pre-trained neural networks that extends them through uncertainty\nmodelling without affecting their predictions.\n• A delta approximation method to propagate the uncertainty from the activation space to\nthe output space.\n• Empirical demonstration that GAPA—and in particular GAPA-Variational—delivers ex-\nceptional performance in uncertainty quantification, outperforming Laplace approxima-\ntions on most datasets.\n• A novel approach to uncertainty quantification by focussing on modelling the uncertainty\nat the activation level rather than in the weight space.\n2. Model Proposition: GAPA + Uncertainty Propagation\nWe begin by presenting the GAPA method, which aims to quantifiy uncertainty in a pre-\ntrained neural network. We assume the network was first trained in a supervised manner on\na dataset D = {(xn, yn)}N\nn=1. Then, to estimate uncertainty, we augment the network by\napplying a Gaussian Process (GP) to the output of each neuron in a layer. To highlight the\ngenerality of the approach we assume here, that this method is applied to the first hidden\nlayer of the network. Figure 1 illustrates the backbone network and the GAPA module.\n2.1. Pretrained Neural Network\nConsider a standard feedforward neural network with L layers: For l = 0, . . . , L, the (l+1)-th\nlayer contains Dl neurons with weight matrix W l ∈RDl×Dl−1, biases bl ∈RDl and activation\nfunction al. For an input x ∈RD0, the network’s prediction is given by\nˆyx = W LaL\u0010\nW L−1aL−1\u0000· · · a1(W 0x + b0) · · ·\n\u0001\n+ bL−1\u0011\n+ bL.\nThis pre-trained network is optimised using standard supervised learning on D, and its\nparameters are subsequently fixed.\n2.2. GAPA: Gausisan Process Activations\nTo quantify the uncertainty of a pre-trained network without affecting its mean predic-\ntions, we attach an independent one-dimensional GP to each neuron in the first layer.\nHere, the pre-trained network (with fixed parameters) has been optimised on the dataset\nD = {(xn, yn)}N\nn=1 using standard supervised learning. Let X := W 0x + b0 ∈RD1 denote\nthe neurons of the first layer. For d ∈{1, . . . , D1}, let Yd := a1(Xd) be the activation of\n3\n\n\nBergna Depeweg Calvo-Ordoñez Plenk Cartea Hernández-Lobato\n−8\n−6\n−4\n−2\n0\n2\n4\n6\nx\n−3\n−2\n−1\n0\n1\n2\n3\ny\nTanh: Neuron 1\nTraining Data\nGP Predictive Mean\n−3\n−2\n−1\n0\n1\nx\n−3\n−2\n−1\n0\n1\n2\n3\ny\nTanh: Neuron 10\nTraining Data\nGP Predictive Mean\n−0.9\n−0.8\n−0.7\n−0.6\n−0.5\n−0.4\n−0.3\n−0.2\n−0.1\nx\n−3\n−2\n−1\n0\n1\n2\n3\ny\nTanh: Neuron 11\nTraining Data\nGP Predictive Mean\n−0.9\n−0.8\n−0.7\n−0.6\n−0.5\n−0.4\n−0.3\n−0.2\n−0.1\nx\n−3\n−2\n−1\n0\n1\n2\n3\ny\nGAPA: Neuron 11\nTraining Data\nGP Predictive Mean\n95% Confidence Interval\n−3\n−2\n−1\n0\n1\nx\n−3\n−2\n−1\n0\n1\n2\n3\ny\nGAPA: Neuron 10\nTraining Data\nGP Predictive Mean\n95% Confidence Interval\n−0.9\n−0.8\n−0.7\n−0.6\n−0.5\n−0.4\n−0.3\n−0.2\n−0.1\nx\n−3\n−2\n−1\n0\n1\n2\n3\ny\nGAPA: Neuron 11\nTraining Data\nGP Predictive Mean\n95% Confidence Interval\nFigure 2: Baseline activations (Top) versus GAPA activations (bottom) for neurons 1, 10, 11.\nGAPA preserves the mean activation while providing an uncertainty estimate.\nthe d-th neuron. We introduce uncertainty at the activation-level by replacing a1(Xd) with\na GP fd(Xd) + ϵd.\nHere, we assume a GP prior fd ∼GP(md, kd), with mean function\nmd(Xd) := a1(Xd), and a covariance kernel kd (specifically, the RBF kernel with hyperpa-\nrameters learned via an empirical method; see Appendix A for further details). Denote the\nneurons and activations of the training data at the first layer by X and Yd = a1(Xd). The\nposterior mean is computed as\nµd(Xd) = md(Xd) + kd(Xd, Xd)\nh\nKd(Xd, Xd) + σ2\nnIN\ni−1\u0010\nYd −md(Xd)\n\u0011\n.\nAs we have Yd = md(Xd) by construction, it follows that µd(Xd) = md(Xd) = a1(Xd).\nHence the pre-trained network’s original activation is preserved. The posterior covariance\nΣd(Xd, X′\nd) = kd(Xd, X′\nd) −kd(Xd, Xd)\nh\nKd(Xd, Xd) + σ2\nnIN\ni−1\nkd(Xd, X′\nd),\nquantifies the epistemic uncertainty in the d-th neuron’s activation. Note, that this doesn’t\ndepend on the prior mean. As shown in Figure 2 for neurons 1, 10, and 11, the GAPA\nmodel preserves the baseline activations while adding a principled uncertainty estimate. In\nsummary, by using a GP whose prior mean is set equal to the neuron’s true activation\n(i.e. its label), we preserve the pre-trained network’s mean predictions while simultaneously\nproviding a rigorous uncertainty epistemic estimate via the GP’s posterior covariance.\n2.3. Propagating the Variance through the Network\nSince the GP at the first layer is constructed to preserve the pre-trained network’s mean\nactivations, the mean forward pass remains identical to that of the pre-trained model. We\nnow need to define a variance-forward path. For this we identify two scenarios: linear layers\n(such as in dense and convolutional layers) and non-linear activation functions.\nLinear Transformation of Variance.\nSince a linear transformation of a Gaussian re-\nmains Gaussian, if the input variance is Σa and the linear layer applies a transformation\nz = Wa, then the resulting variance is given by Σz = W Σa W ⊤.\n4\n\n\nPost-Hoc Uncertainty Quantification in Pre-Trained Neural Networks via Activation-Level Gaussian P\nPropagation Rules for Non-Linear Activations.\nFor a non-linear activation y = g(z)\napplied to a Gaussian random variable z ∼N(µ, σ2), we approximate g(z) by a first-order\nTaylor expansion (delta approximation)\ng(z) ≈g(µ) + g′(µ)(z −µ).\nSince z −µ ∼N(0, σ2), this yields an approximate variance of Var(y) ≈(g′(µ))2 σ2.\nOverall Variance Propagation.\nBy sequentially applying the linear transformation rule\nfor variance and the delta approximation for non-linear activations, we obtain a tractable,\nlayer-wise method for propagating uncertainty from the first layer (where the GP is applied)\nto the final network output.\n2.4. GAPA-Free: Linear Scaling of the Output Variance\nAfter propagating uncertainty to the network output, we refine the variance using a simple\nlinear transformation:\nVarfinal = θ1 Varoutput +θ2,\nwhere θ1 (a scaling factor) and θ2 (an offset) are learned to capture any residual uncer-\ntainty. This calibration is computationally efficient since it involves only two parameters\nand requires no additional backpropagation through the network.\n2.5. GAPA-Variational\nIn GAPA-Variational, rather than applying a fixed linear scaling, the GP variational pa-\nrameters (similar to those used in variational GPs (Titsias, 2009)) are optimized via max-\nimum likelihood.\nFor each neuron d, we assume a GP prior fd ∼GP\n\u0000md, kd\n\u0001\nwith\nmd(Xd) = a1(Xd) (i.e. the neuron’s activation) and a covariance kernel kd (e.g. the RBF\nkernel with empirically determined hyperparameters). We introduce inducing variables ud\nwith fixed inducing inputs Zd = Xd (taken from the training data of the first layer) and\nset the inducing mean to md(Zd) = a1(Zd). The corresponding variational distribution is\ndefined as q(ud) = N\n\u0000md(Zd), Sd\n\u0001\n, where Sd (the variational covariance) and the kernel hy-\nperparameters θd are learned. Let yi denote the target for the ith input, and let µi and σ2\ni\nbe the predictive mean and variance obtained by propagating the GP uncertainties through\nthe network (using, for example, the delta approximation). Because the GP prior mean is\nfixed to the pre-trained activation, the posterior mean remains unchanged and only the un-\ncertainty (variance) is learned. Consequently, the overall training objective is the Gaussian\nnegative log-likelihood (NLL) L = PN\ni=1\n1\n2 log\n\u00002πσ2\ni\n\u0001\n+ (yi−µi)2\n2σ2\ni\n.\nThis loss function is optimized by backpropagating the NLL from the network’s final\noutput while keeping the pre-trained network weights fixed. In this way, GAPA-Variational\nprovides a flexible, data-driven uncertainty estimate through the learned GP covariance, all\nwhile preserving the original mean predictions of the pre-trained network.\n3.

We follow the original train/test splits used in prior studies.\nTable 1 summarizes the performance of our proposed models compared to state-of-the-\nart post-processing methods on several regression datasets. Our evaluation metrics include\nNegative Log-Likelihood (NLL), Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) (Gneiting\nand Raftery, 2007), and the Centered Quantile Metric (CQM) (Ortega et al., 2023). In the\ntable, the best values are highlighted in purple, the second-best in teal, and the third-best in\nbronze. Our experimental results show that both GAPA-Free and GAPA-Variational achieve\ncompetitive performance.\nNotably, GAPA-Variational consistently enhances uncertainty\nquantification. For example, on the Airline dataset, it attains the best CRPS while its NLL\nand CQM values rank among the top three. On the Year dataset, GAPA-Variational records\nthe best CRPS and CQM scores with a competitive NLL. Most importantly, on the Taxi\ndataset, it outperforms all other methods across all metrics. These findings indicate that\nour approach successfully propagates uncertainty from the activation space to the network’s\nfinal output without altering the pre-trained network’s predictions. As a result, GAPA-\nVariational preserves the base network’s predictive accuracy while providing a more reliable\nand nuanced uncertainty estimate, making it well suited for risk-sensitive applications.\n4. Related Work\nIn Morales-Alvarez et al. (2020), auNN replaces activations with GPs and trains them jointly\nacross layers via variational inference, requiring multiple samples at inference time.\nIn\ncontrast, our method uses the original activation (e.g., ReLU) as the GP prior mean—\nthereby preserving the pre-trained network’s predictions—and fits GPs solely to quantify\nthe uncertainty of the activation function. This post-hoc approach avoids re-training the\nnetwork and achieves uncertainty estimation with a single forward pass.\n6\n\n\nPost-Hoc Uncertainty Quantification in Pre-Trained Neural Networks via Activation-Level Gaussian P\n5. Conclusion\nIn this work, we have introduced the Gaussian Process Activation function (GAPA), a novel\nframework designed to quantify uncertainty in pre-trained neural networks. We have also\npresented a theoretically principled method to propagate uncertainty from the activations\nspace to the output space using the delta approximation approach. Our approach empirically\noutperforms the Laplace approximation method, achieving faster training times. Neverthe-\nless, Gaussian processes remain computationally expensive at inference time. Future work\nwill focus on exploring scalable models or approximations to Gaussian processes to optimise\ncomputational efficiency, as well as extending the model to classification task.\nReferences\nEdmon Begoli, Tanmoy Bhattacharya, and Dimitri Kusnezov.

In this work, we introduce FieldMACE, an extension of the message-passing atomic\ncluster expansion (MACE) architecture that integrates the multipole expansion to model\nlong-range interactions more efficiently. By incorporating the multipole expansion, Field-\nMACE effectively captures environmental and long-range effects in both ground and excited\nstates.\nBenchmark evaluations demonstrate its superior performance in predictions and\ncomputational efficiency compared to previous architectures, as well as its ability to accu-\nrately simulate nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics. Furthermore, transfer learning from\nfoundational models enhances data efficiency, making FieldMACE a scalable, robust, and\ntransferable framework for large-scale molecular simulations.\nI.\nINTRODUCTION\nOver the past few years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in modeling\nmolecules and materials due to the natural graph-like structure of chemical systems [1–4]. However,\ncapturing long-range interactions, particularly electrostatics, remains a key challenge [5]. These\ninteractions are crucial when considering solvent effects [6, 7] or for phenomena such as protein\n∗julia.westermayr@uni-leipzig.de\narXiv:2502.21045v1  [physics.comp-ph]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\n2\nfolding [8, 9]. However, their slow decay with distance makes them difficult to represent accurately\n[10, 11].\nMany frequently applied GNN models focus on interactions among immediate neighbors [12, 13].\nAs a result, purely local descriptors often miss subtle, but important long-range forces, leading to\ninaccuracies when simulating systems like proteins or hybrid organic-inorganic interfaces [14, 15]\nthat are often dominated by these effects. Various strategies have been proposed to address this\nlimitation [16, 17], among them, message-passing methods, which exchange information among\nneighboring nodes, but their limited depth restricts the effective receptive field, making it difficult\nto account for distant atoms.\nOther approaches use additional physics-based terms [18, 19] or\nincorporate data from large, extended systems [16, 20] such as some of the systems in the OC20\n[21] dataset, which describes molecules on surfaces, although these can be prohibitively expensive\nto generate.\nA more efficient alternative takes inspiration from QM/MM (quantum mechanics/molecular me-\nchanics) [22, 23] methodologies. In these methods, the region undergoing critical chemical transfor-\nmations is modeled quantum mechanically, while the surrounding environment is treated classically.\nAn illustration of this approach is shown in the top right of Fig. 1. This reduces the computational\ncost for large systems without sacrificing essential chemical accuracy.\nTraditional machine learning (ML) models that include long-range effects often assign node\nfeatures to every atom in the system and perform periodic updates thereof, even if many atoms\nare only characterized by a simple charge [24–26]. This leads to excessive computational overhead\nand poor scaling. To address this issue, some approaches incorporate physics-based features from\nthe classically treated region into the quantum region. For example, FieldSchNet [27] includes the\nelectric field generated by the partial charges of the MM atoms as an extra feature for the ML\nmodel that describes the QM region. This significantly reduces the computational time for training\ncompared to methods like SO3krates [24], since only a subset of atoms requires full periodically\nupdated node features, while the rest can be captured through external interactions. While this\nstrategy efficiently represents some long-range effects without sacrificing computational speed, it\nrelies on a single scalar value (the electric field), which may not fully capture the complex nature\nof the interactions between MM and QM region.\nOne way to expand existing ML methods within the QM/MM methodology is via the introduc-\ntion of higher-order features through the multipole expansion [28, 29]. The multipole expansion\noffers a systematic way to decompose electrostatic interactions into hierarchical terms, which nat-\nurally fits with equivariant neural networks, especially those based on spherical harmonics. In this\n\n\n3\nwork, we incorporate these features into the message-passing atomic cluster expansion (MACE)\n[30] architecture, resulting in FieldMACE, and demonstrate how this approach can be applied to\nboth ground- and excited-state simulations. Additionally, transfer learning from the foundational\nMACE-OFF [31] model originally trained on ground-state data without the inclusion of an environ-\nment is shown to significantly reduce the amount of data needed [32, 33] for accurate predictions.\nMost notably, we show that this refinement can replicate reference population curves obtained from\nnonadiabatic excited-state dynamics [34, 35]. These simulations are, when conducted with quan-\ntum chemistry, computationally intensive, often requiring months of computation[36], and still pose\nchallenges to ML models [37–39]. In this work, as little as 30 excited-state data points are required\nwhen using transfer learning for reproducing excited-state nonadiabatic molecular dynamics.\nII.\nPRELIMINARIES AND RELATED WORK\n{R1, ....., Rn}   {Z1, ....., Zn}\nReadouts\nMessage \nConstruction \nMessage \nAggregation \nEmbedding\nLong Range Interaction\nShort Range Interaction\nLong Range Interaction\nLong Range Interaction\nShort Range Interaction\ni\nj\nh1\nht\nht\nh5\nh4\nh3\nProperties\nhQM\nhi\nwij\na)\nb)\nQM\nMM\nh2\nh0\nh1\nh5\nh4\nh3\nh2\nm2\nm1\nmt\nmt\nm3\nm4\nh0\nm5\nht\nht\nht\nht\nht+1\nht+1\nht+1\nht+1\nht+1\nht+1\nmt\nmt\nmt\nShort Range\nQM/MM System \nPairwise Aggregation\n1\n1\n2 3\n3\n4\n4\n5\n5\ni\ni\ni i\ni\n2\nPairwise Attention \nComputation\nMM Atoms\n1 2 3 4 5\nh1  h2  h3  h4  h5  h6 \nhMMhMMhMMhMMhMMhMM\nEmbedding\nQM Node \nFeature\nAttention Multipole \nExpansion Φi \nm0\nm0\n= \n+ \n \nΦi\nQM \nMM \nFIG. 1.\nArchitecture of the message-passing neural network integrated with the multipole\nexpansion a) The short-range blocks operate through a message-passing scheme aggregating information\nin the atoms local neighborhood, whereas the long-range blocks collect information on molecular mechanics\n(MM) nodes through the multipole expansion. b) The long-range block uses pairwise attention weightings\nthat are computed between the quantum mechanics (QM) region and MM atoms. These are combined with\nMM node features and the QM node features in the multipole expansion described in Section III.\n\n\n4\nA.\nMessage-passing\nAtoms in a molecular system are characterized by their position vector ri ∈R3 and atomic\nnumber Zi. These systems can be represented as graphs, where atoms correspond to nodes Vi,\nand all nodes in the neighborhood of central atom i, N(i) = {Vj | ||rij||2 = ||ri −rj||2 < rcut}\nare connected by edges, where rcut is a predefined cutoff radius. The categorical atomic numbers\nare transformed into a learnable invariant embedding vector Xi ∈Rk. During the message-passing\nprocess [40, 41] each atom i is associated with a set of features hi ∈Rk, and each edge (i, j)\nis assigned the vector between the two atoms rij. The features are initialized with the atomic\nembedding h0\ni = Xi and then updated through an iterative process:\nm(t)\nij = ϕmsg\n\u0010\nh(t)\ni , h(t)\nj , rij\n\u0011\n(1)\nm(t)\ni\n=\nX\nj∈N(i)\nm(t)\nij\n(2)\nh(t+1)\ni\n= ϕupdate\n\u0010\nh(t)\ni , m(t)\ni\n\u0011\n(3)\nThis process involves three main steps: i) creation of the messages m(t)\nij that are computed for each\nedge using a learnable function ϕmsg and the vector rij. ii) These messages are aggregated over\nthe neighborhood of each node using a permutation-invariant operation, such as summation. iii)\nFinally, node features hi are updated using another learnable function ϕupdate. Messages passed\nbetween atoms in the neighborhood N(i) can represent scalar or higher-order features depending\non the approach chosen. An illustration of the message-passing process can be seen in Fig. 1a\n(short-range block).\nB.\nEquivariance\nVectorial properties of a molecular system are uniquely defined by the orientation of it in space,\ni.e. if the entire system rotates, associated properties have to transform accordingly, which is known\nas equivariance [42]. Formally the set of features hi is called equivariant under a group G if\nD(R)hi(r1, ..., rn) = hi(R ◦(r1, ..., rn)) ,\n(4)\nwhere R ∈G and D(R) is the equivalent operation acting on hi. The main focus of this paper will\nbe on the special orthogonal group SO(3). In the case of SO(3), these equivariant features can be\nbroken down into smaller building blocks [43], the spherical harmonic functions, Yℓm(θ, ϕ) acting on\n\n\n5\nthe sphere, where ℓrepresents the degree and m corresponds to the order, m ∈{−ℓ, ..., ℓ}. Under\na rotation R ∈SO(3), the spherical harmonics transform as follows:\nYℓm′(θ′, ϕ′) =\nX\nm\nDℓ\nm′m(R)Yℓm(θ, ϕ),\n(5)\nwith Dℓ\nm′m(R) being the Wigner-D matrices. In most cases, the equivariant feature vectors are\nexpressed as a series of vectors where each is associated to a certain spherical harmonic, known\nas channels. The equivariant features are indexed as hℓ\ni,m,k where k is the channel index. The\nmessage-passing framework can be rewritten in terms of these spherical harmonics. In this case\nonly two body features will be considered, describing only interactions between neighbors around\natom i.\nmL,(t)\nM,i,j,k = Rℓ1m1(rij) Yℓ1m1(θ, ϕ)hℓ2,(t)\nj,m2,k\n(6)\nmℓ,(t)\nm,i,k =\nX\nL,M\nClm\nL,M\nX\nj∈N(i)\nmL,(t)\nM,i,j,k\n(7)\nhℓ,(t+1)\ni,m,k\n= wl\nmkkmℓ,(t)\nm,i,k + hℓ,(t)\ni,m,k\n(8)\nL = (ℓ1, ℓ2),\nM = (m1, m2)\nThe angles θ and ϕ correspond to the directionality of the unit vector of rij and rij the distance\nbetween atoms i and j. The values wl\nmkk′ correspond to learnable, linear transformations across\nthe channel of each spherical harmonic, an additional non-linear function can be placed along with\nthe linear transformation. In order to preserve the correct equivariance for each order of spherical\nharmonics we must include the standard Clebsch Gordan coefficients Clm\nL,M [44]. The equations\nabove form the basic block to the short range interactions in the following section. These blocks\ncan also be exchanged with MACE which is discussed in the Appendix A.\nC.\nMultipole Expansion\nThe multipole expansion is a technique that decomposes complex electromagnetic fields into\nhierarchical terms. This approach is particularly useful for analyzing fields far from their sources,\nwhere higher-order contributions become negligible. These moments are constructed in terms of\nspherical harmonics allowing a direct integration into equivariant neural networks that already use\nspherical harmonics such as MACE.\nA scalar potential Φ(r) arising from a charge distribution ρ(r′), where r is the field point and r′\n\n\n6\nis the source point, is defined by Coulomb’s law as\nΦ(r) =\n1\n4πε0\nZ\nρ(r′)\n|r −r′| dr′ .\n(9)\nThe function\n1\n|r−r′| can be expressed as a sum of spherical harmonics when r < r′:\n1\n|r −r′| =\n∞\nX\nℓ=0\nℓ\nX\nm=−ℓ\n4π\n2ℓ+ 1\n\u0010 r\nr′\n\u0011ℓ\nYℓm(θ, ϕ)Yℓm∗(θ′, ϕ′)\n(10)\nSubstituting this expansion into Coulomb’s law yields:\nΦ(r) = 1\nε0\n∞\nX\nℓ=0\nℓ\nX\nm=−ℓ\n1\n2ℓ+ 1\nYℓm(θ, ϕ)\nrℓ+1\nQℓm,\n(11)\nwhere the multipole moment Qℓm is defined as:\nQℓm =\nZ\nr′ℓρ(r′)Yℓm∗(θ′, ϕ′) dr′.\n(12)\nEach term in this expansion corresponds to a specific multipole order, with higher-order terms\ndecaying more rapidly with distance. These multipole moments will be used as feature vectors in\nthe following section.\nIII.\nINTEGRATION OF QM/MM FRAMEWORK WITH EQUIVARIANT NEURAL\nNETWORKS\nOur method splits a chemical system into a QM and an MM region. The descriptors for the\nQM region are derived in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. The MM atoms are described by their positions and\npartial charges that are assigned by a classical force field. While this is sufficient for the construction\nof the multipole expansion, the direct summation leads to significant information loss. To address\nthis, we introduce weightings towards each of the MM atoms. Concretely, we compute pairwise\nattention coefficients [45] between the QM node features and the MM atom features to establish\nappropriate weightings.\nA.\nAttention Weightings\nInitial feature vectors for the MM atoms comprise spherical harmonics values, Y MM\nℓm , computed\nfrom the position values. These values are expanded to produce MM node features,\nhℓ,MM\nj,m,k′ = wℓ\nmk′Y MM\nj,ℓm\n(13)\n\n\n7\nwhere wl\nmk′ is a mapping R →Rk′.\nTo reduce computational costs, k’ can be tuned as a hy-\nperparameter and remains k’< k. A similar contraction operation is performed for the QM node\nfeatures:\nhℓ,QM,(t)\ni,m,k′\n= wℓ\nmk′khℓ,QM,(t)\ni,m,k\n,\n(14)\nwhere wl\nmk′k is a mapping Rk →Rk′. Given these feature vectors, pairwise attention is taken\nbetween QM atoms and each of the MM atoms.\nNote that no attention is computed between\nMM atoms. This significantly reduces the computational cost for large systems, full element-wise\ncomparison scales with O(n2) whereas element-wise comparison between only MM and QM scales\nwith O(n) with the QM region being assumed to be constant. The element-wise comparisons are\nperformed using an L1 norm\nκ(t)\nijk′ = ξℓ\nmk′k′(|hℓ,QM,(t)\ni,m,k′\n−hℓ,MM\nj,m,k′|)\n(15)\nHere ξ consists of a linear transformation followed by a softmax normalization. These weighting\nvalues can be integrated into the multipole expansion to obtain the attention weighted expansion.\nAn illustration of computing the attention weights can be seen beneath the long-range interaction\nblock in Figure 1.\nB.\nAttention Multipole Expansion\nThe charge distribution surrounding the QM region can be described by a set of point charges\nobtained from the MM atoms, qMM\nj\n;\nρ(r′) =\n\n\n\n\n\nqMM\nj\n,\nif r′ = rMM\nj\n,\n0,\notherwise.\n(16)\nThis simplifies the multipole moments, eq. (12), into a sum over these discrete charges.\nQℓ\nm,k′ =\nX\nj\n(rMM\nj\n)lqMM\nj\nhℓ,MM\nj,m,k′ .\n(17)\nIt is important to note that the system is shifted so that the QM region is centered on the origin\nto maintain translational invariance. The multipole expansion can now be written including the\nweighting values for atom i in the QM region,\nΦℓm,(t)\ni,k′\n(rQM\ni\n) = 1\nε0\nX\nj\nκ(t)\nijk′\nQℓ\nm,j,k′\n2ℓ+ 1\nhℓ,QM,(t)\ni,m,k′\n|rQM\ni\n−rMM\nj\n|ℓ+1\n(18)\nQℓ\nm,j,k′ = (rMM\nj\n)lqMM\nj\nhℓ,MM\nj,m,k′\n(19)\n\n\n8\nThe term Φℓm,(t)\ni,k′\n(rQM\ni\n) incorporates the necessary long-range information from the MM atoms for\nnode feature hQM,(t)\ni\nat atom i.\nC.\nMessage Construction\nThe message is updated again after the short range message update eq. 7 by incorporating the\nmultipole expansion term after expanding it to the correct dimensionality:\nmℓ,(t)\nm,i,k = mℓ,(t)\nm,i,k + wℓ,(t)\nmkk′Φℓm,(t)\ni,k′\n(rQM\ni\n)\n(20)\nThe node features are constructed from these messages in the same way as seen in eq. (8). These\nnode features can be expanded to include many body interactions as well as other effects in the\nQM region. An illustration of the long range interaction implementation can be seen in the right\nhalf of Figure 1. Our long-range multipole message is integrated into the MACE framework.\nIV.\nEXPERIMENTS\nTABLE I.

To this end, we\ntest our model on the datasets by [46] comprising three molecular systems, namely benzene, uracil,\nand retinoic acid modeled under explicit environment. Each data set comprises molecules solvated\n\n\n9\nin water, full details of the dataset can be found in the Appendix B 1 or respective publication.\nWe showcase the performance of our method using different representation sizes and compare it to\nanother state-of-the-art model (FieldSchNet) that can be used for ML/MM, where ML is used to\napproximate the QM part of the system. In addition, we compute the vibrational power spectrum\nwith FieldMACE for benzene solvated in water and compare the spectrum to a quantum chemical\nreference spectrum. In addition, we gauge FieldMACE’s capacity to handle electronically excited\nstates by computing population curves resulting from nonadiabatic photodynamics simulations.\nFinally, we explore the potential for reusing parameters from foundational ground-state models\ntrained without an external environment, particularly the MACE-OFF model, which allows us to\nobtain lower errors with less amount of data compared to directly trained models.\nA.\nGround State Simulations\nTo evaluate the performance of FieldMACE in predicting energies and forces in the presence of an\nenvironment, we benchmark it against FieldSchNet [39], a recently developed model that can be used\nfor QM/MM simulations. Full architecture and training details can be found in the Appendix C. To\nthe best of our knowledge, there are currently few ML approaches capable of effectively describing\nmolecular systems [39, 47–57] in the presence of implicit or explicit environments. Many other\nmodels that are used for ML/MM or similar simulations often do not take the influence of an\nenvironment into account, by relying for instance on so-called mechanical embedding approaches\n(neglecting any electrostatic interactions), or by using specific embedding schemes, like the Buffered\nRegion Neural Network approach (BuRNN),[58] where the whole system is split into three regions\nrather than two and the ML model learns the difference between regions rather than the QM\nregion. Thus, to allow for a fair comparison, the benchmark focuses exclusively on the FieldSchNet\nand FieldMACE models. The results, presented in Table I summarize the mean absolute errors\n(MAEs) for energy and force predictions. As can be seen, FieldMACE consistently outperforms\nFieldSchNet, particularly at smaller representation sizes, demonstrating its capability to capture\nboth short- and long-range interactions while being more compact. For energy predictions, both\nmodels show reduced errors with increasing representation size. Across all systems, FieldMACE\nconsistently exhibits lower errors for both energy and forces.\nIn addition to evaluating test scores, we simulate the photodynamics of solvated benzene and\ncompare the associated power spectra of the ML/MM and QM/MM reference dynamics in Figure 2a,\ncomputational details can be found in Appendix B.2.

Transitions to S1 and S0\nare present in both approaches.\npower spectrum in agreement with the QM spectrum, particularly, it reproduces the characteristic\nC–H stretching modes located near 3000 cm−1 as well as the C=C ring stretching and C-H bending\nmodes contained in the distributions centered around 1000 cm−1. In general, the peaks of the ML\nspectrum are located at the same frequencies as in the QM reference, only their relative intensity\nvaries slightly.\nB.\nExcited State Dynamics\nGoing beyond ground state simulations, FieldMACE is used to simulate nonadiabatic dynamics\nusing trajectory surface hopping (TSH) [59, 60].\nThese simulations describe the behavior of a\nmolecule after being excited by light and are computationally much more demanding than ground-\nstate simulations, especially when an explicit environment is included, as is the case here. TSH\nrecovers the quantum nature of the excited wave packet by averaging over many trajectories that\nhave different initial conditions (i.e. configurations and momenta). In Tully’s Fewest Switches TSH\n[59, 61], used here, each trajectory changes its active state via so-called hops stochastically. For\nthe photodynamics simulations, we integrated our FieldMACE approach into the SHARC (Surface\nHopping including Arbitrary Couplings) program suite [34, 62–64].\nWe investigate the molecule furan solvated in water to assess Field-MACE for excited-state\ndynamics. Details on the model and training are specified in Appendix D. Upon excitation, the\nmolecule can undergo a ring-opening reaction. We compare our model to recent simulations of this\nsystem using FieldSchNarc [39].\nFigure 2b and c show the population dynamics obtained using FieldMACE (panel b) and the\n\n\n11\nquantum chemical reference method (panel c). Population curves represent a distribution over the\nactive state showing how the system evolves over time and hops between different electronic states.\nAt the beginning of the simulations, the system is excited to the second excited singlet state, S2.\nThe nonadiabatic dynamics then show non-radiative decay back to the electronic ground state, S0.\nFieldMACE accurately captures the rapid decay from the S2 and the subsequent redistribution of\npopulations to the S1 and the ground state, S0. The predicted population transfer closely matches\nquantum chemical reference populations. As can be seen, in both cases the S2 population transfers\nquickly to the S1 state, which is populated until around 100 fs, at which point the majority of the\ntrajectories fall back into the ground state.\nV.\nTRANSFERABILITY\nA.\nGround State\nIn this section, we analyze the possibility of reducing the amount of data necessary when start-\ning with weights from pre-trained foundational ground-state models that have not been trained\nincluding an environment or excited-state effects. Therefore, we leverage the foundational MACE\nmodel’s pre-trained representations as initial parameters for FieldMACE’s short-range modules to\nimprove performance and data efficiency. Full details on the models and training can be found in\nAppendix B.\nAs can be seen in Figure 3, which shows learning curves using different amounts of data for fine-\ntuning for three molecular systems in solution, initializing the short-range blocks of FieldMACE with\nthe foundational model weights reduces the amount of training data required to achieve comparable\naccuracy to models trained from scratch, particularly for force predictions (second line, panels d-\nf). Across all systems, the pre-trained initialization demonstrates a clear advantage, leading to\nimproved accuracy compared to random initialization, even though the foundational models do not\nincorporate any solvent effects.\nThe benefits of using the foundational representation are most pronounced in systems with few\nstrongly electronegative atoms, as is the case in benzene (first column, panels a and d) or retinoic\nacid (last column, panels c and f). These molecules are characterized by weaker intermolecular\ninteractions and limited hydrogen bonding with the surrounding water molecules. The resulting\npotential energy surfaces for these systems will thus be more similar to the potential energy surfaces\nin a vacuum compared to the uracil system.\n\n\n12\nIn contrast, for polar systems like uracil (middle column, panels b and e), which feature strong\nhydrogen bonding and complex electrostatic interactions, the benefits of the pre-trained initial-\nization are less pronounced. While transfer-learned FieldMACE still outperforms the randomly\ninitialized model, the benefit is smaller compared to the other examples. This suggests that the\nfoundational model’s learned parameters have to be changed more in systems that interact more\nstrongly with the MM environment. Here, additional refinement on another dataset or task-specific\ntraining would improve performance for highly polar systems.\na)\nb)\nc)\nd)\ne)\nf)\nFIG. 3. Comparison of transfer learning from MACE-OFF foundational model (red curves) against randomly\ninitialized FieldMACE models (blue curves).\nEvaluation of transfer and ordinary learning models with\nrespect to energies (top row) and forces (bottom row) of molecules solvated in water: a) and d) benzene ,\nb) and e) uracil and c) and f) retinoic acid .\nB.\nExcited States\nTo further test the ability of FieldMACE to profit from transfer learning by heavily reducing\nthe amount of training data needed, we revisit the furan in water system.\nFull details on the\nmodel and training can be found in Appendix D. Rather than considering the mere test statistics\n(meaning error for energies and forces on the test set), we generate the population curves for the\nsame set of initial conditions used in the previous section with FieldMACE models trained with a\ndecreasing number of data. We compare FieldMACE models trained from scratch with randomly\n\n\n13\ninitialized parameters and those where the short-range block parameters are taken from a MACE-\nOFF model. We use only 600, 150, and 30 data points to train these models. Since excited-state\ndata are computationally much more costly to obtain, this is a realistic use case. The results are\nshown in Figure 4.\nFor the largest dataset with 600 data points (first column), both transfer (panel a) and non-\ntransfer models (panel d) result in similar population curves that align well with the reference\nresults (Figure 2 c). Deviations in the S2, S1, and S0 populations remain minimal throughout the\nsimulation compared to the reference population curves. When the dataset size is reduced to 150\npoints (middle column), the predictions are reasonable for both transfer (panel b) and non-transfer\n(panel e) models.\nIn contrast, for the smallest dataset of 30 data points (last column), a stark difference emerges\nbetween the two initialization strategies. The transfer model (panel c), leveraging the foundational\nrepresentation, maintains a reasonable albeit worse approximation of the population curves and\nless stable simulations, capturing the general trends in decay and redistribution among electronic\nstates. However, the model trained from scratch (panel f) fails to accurately capture the transition\ndynamics or the populations of S2, S1, and S0. These results highlight the critical importance of\ntransfer learning in low-data regimes, where the foundational representation enables FieldMACE\nto generalize effectively despite very limited training data.\nOverall, the results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly enhances FieldMACE’s per-\nformance, particularly when training data is scarce. With sufficient data (600 or 150 data points),\nboth transfer and non-transfer models can perform reasonably well, though transfer learning pro-\nvides an edge in accuracy. In low-data scenarios (30 data points), transfer learning is essential for\nmaintaining reasonable predictions albeit less stable simulations, but the non-transfer model fails\nto capture the dynamics adequately. These findings emphasize the use of pre-trained foundational\nrepresentations for obtaining accurate models.\nVI.\nDISCUSSION\nThe attention weighted multipole expansion presented in this paper highlights an effective way\nof combining spherical harmomics-based equivariant neural networks with external charge distribu-\ntions. In particular, results presented in this study highlight the significant advancements achieved\nby combining the multipole expansion with the MACE neural network architecture, FieldMACE,\nparticularly its transferability and efficiency in modeling both ground-state and excited-state molec-\n\n\n14\na)\nb)\nc)\nf)\ne)\nd)\nFIG. 4.

By leveraging the foundational MACE model representations, FieldMACE demon-\nstrates its ability to extrapolate to new molecular systems while requiring less training data, es-\npecially for force predictions.\nThis capability underscores the potential of pre-trained machine\nlearning models in quantum chemistry.\nOne of the most notable findings is the effectiveness of FieldMACE in low-data regimes. For\nexcited-state dynamics, the transfer learning approach from ground-state foundational models en-\nabled FieldMACE to produce reasonable population dynamics even with as little as 30 data points,\nwhereas models initialized with random weights failed to capture the underlying processes. This is\nparticularly impactful given the computational expense associated with generating training data for\nexcited-state simulations. The ability to maintain predictive accuracy with reduced datasets makes\nFieldMACE a practical choice for studying complex systems where data availability is limited.\nWhen comparing FieldMACE with other molecular architectures that incorporate long-range\ninteractions such as SO3Krates, the balance between accuracy and computational expense must be\nconsidered. In these architectures pairwise attention weightings are computed for all pairs in the\nsystem which leads to quadratic scaling, O(n2). In some cases considering interactions between all\natoms in the system may be necessary but in many cases it is not. For instance, in the presented\nuracil system, which contains more than 3000 atoms, the only area of high significance is the uracil\n\n\n15\nmolecule. Training a single epoch while considering all pairwise interactions and assigning large\nnode features can lead to prohibitively large computational costs to train these models. FieldMACE\nsignificantly reduces this computational burden by only considering interactions between the QM\nand MM atoms, thus allowing linear scaling when increasing the size of the external environment.\nThis leads to a dramatic reduction in computational overhead, and thus allows us to train on\nextended systems.\nIn summary, FieldMACE represents a significant step forward in transferable machine learning\nmodels for molecular simulations in the presence of external charge distributions such as QM/MM\nsimulations. Its ability to train on very large systems, combined with its accuracy in low-data\nregimes, makes it a powerful tool for QM/MM simulations in both ground and excited states. Future\nwork will focus on enhancing its performance for highly polar systems, expanding its application to\nbroader chemical spaces, and applying FieldMACE to systems such as proteins where long-range\ninteractions are particularly dominant.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work is funded in parts by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) – Project-ID\n443871192 - GRK 2721: \"Hydrogen Isotopes 1,2,3H\".

This expansion incorporates higher-order\nterms, which are essential for accurately modeling complex molecular interactions. The message\nm(t)\ni\nat iteration t is expressed as a sum over many-body contributions:\nm(t)\ni\n=\nX\nj∈N1(i)\nϕ1\n\u0010\nh(t)\ni , h(t)\nj , rij\n\u0011\n+\nX\nj1∈N2(i)\nX\nj2∈N2(j1)\nϕ2\n\u0010\nh(t)\ni , h(t)\nj1 , h(t)\nj2 , rij1, rj1j2\n\u0011\n...\n+\nX\nj1,...,jν∈Nν(i)\nϕν\n\u0010\nh(t)\ni , .., h(t)\njν , rij1, .., rjν−1jν\n\u0011\n,\nwhere Nν(i) denotes the set of ν-th order neighbors of node i, and ϕν represents the learnable\ninteraction function incorporating many-body effects. This operation is computationally expensive\nbut can be significantly reduced by constructing higher-order terms using tensor products of two\nbody features then symmetrizing. The full derivations of the MACE architecture can be seen in\nthe following sources [30, 66].\nAppendix B: Ground State Simulation Details\n1.\nMolecular Datasets\nThe configurations, energies, and forces for the three molecules solvated in water were taken from\nBoöselt et al. [46]. Simulation details are briefly summarized here: All simulations were performed\n\n\n20\nusing a QM/MM approach with the DFT functionals BP86 [67] for retonic acid, ωB97X-D3 [68, 69]\nfor uracil, and B2-PLYP [70] for benzene; the def2-TZVP basis set was used for all calculations. The\nresolution of identity (RI) approximation [71], Grimme’s dispersion correction with Becke–Johnson\ndamping [69], and electrostatic embedding were used to account for long-range interactions. The\nMM region consists of water molecules modeled with the SPC/E water model [72]. The QM/MM\nHamiltonian incorporated MM point charges within a cutoff radius of 0.6 nm for benzene and 1.4 nm\nfor uracil and retinoic acid.\nEach solute was solvated in a periodic water box, with sizes of 1.6 nm, 3.3 nm and 5.0 nm\nrespectively for benzene, uracil and retonic acid. The number of MM partial charges included was\napproximately 1500–2000 for uracil and 2500 for retinoic acid, while benzene had a smaller number\nof MM partial charges of 200 due to the smaller box size. The initial structures were generated\nusing the ATB server [73] and relaxed at 0 K with a gradient descent algorithm until the predicted\nenergy change fell below 0.1 kJ mol−1.\nFor the molecular dynamics simulations that were performed, a time step of 0.5 fs was used,\nwith a Nose–Hoover thermostat [74] (0.1 ps coupling constant) and a weak-coupling barostat (0.5 ps\ncoupling constant). Long-range electrostatics beyond 1.4 nm were included using a reaction-field\nmethod. The system was simulated for 20,000 steps at 400 K and 1 bar, with the first 10,000 steps\ndiscarded for equilibration and the remaining 10,000 were saved.\n2.\nSimulation Details for benzene in water\nThe following parameters were used to generate the power spectrum in Fig. 2a. In the QM/MM\nsimulations, an electrostatic embedding was used. The benzene atoms were treated quantum me-\nchanically, while the surrounding water molecules were treated classically with the TIP3P [75]\nmodel. The simulation was done with the atomic simulation environment (ASE) [76]. The simu-\nlation cell was defined as a box of 16.0 Å per side with periodic boundary conditions applied in\nall directions. The QM region, was evaluated at a B3LYP [67]/def-TZVP level. For the ML/MM\nsimulations of the same system, we used the FieldMACE model trained on the benzene dataset.\nThe model used 128 channels with spherical harmonics up to degree 3. The vectors assigned to the\nMM atoms used spherical harmonics up to degree 3 and with 16 channels.\nThe initial geometry was optimized using the BFGS [76] minimizer until the maximum residual\nforce was reduced to 0.1 eV/A, this was performed in the atomic simulation environment in ASE\n[76]. Initial velocities were drawn from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at 300 K. We performed\n\n\n21\nmolecular dynamics with a Langevin integrator using a 1 fs timestep, a friction coefficient of 10 ps−1,\nand a target temperature of 300 K.The system was propagated for a total of 15,000 steps.\nIn order to facilitate a fair comparison between the ML and QM methods, the benzene data\nset from [46] was recomputed at the same level of theory, B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def-TZVP for the QM\nregion with the TIP3P model for the MM region. The ML model was trained on the recomputed\nframes from this data set (see details for the training in the following Sections). The ML/MM-MD\nproducing the ML-based power spectrum was performed with identical settings as the QM/MM-\nMD.\nAppendix C: Training and Model Details\nIn all systems, a 5 Ångstrom cutoff was applied to the ML region to construct the local graph.\nThe training parameters shown in the FieldMACE section below were also used for the transfer\nlearning models, with the exception that the channel size was fixed to 128 for the transfer learning\n[33, 77] and the short range MACE blocks were initialized using the medium size foundational\nMACE-OFF model parameters for the transfer learning. Additionally, the other blocks such as the\nlong range blocks and the readouts were randomly initialized.\n1.\nFieldMACE\nAll trainings were performed on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. For the three datasets (see\nSection B.1.)\nwe used all available configurations, which correspond to 10000 frames for ben-\nzene and uracil, and 9719 structures for retinoic acid.\nIn all cases, we performed an 80:10:10\ntrain:validation:test split. For all FieldMACE models, we used two sets of short- and long-range\nlayers. We trained models with varying channel sizes of 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.Additionally, all models\nwere trained with spherical harmonics up to degree 3 and 8 Bessel basis functions. The initial\nvectors for the MM atoms consisted of spherical harmonics up to degree 3, combined with an\nembedding vector of size 16 (not varied between models).\nAll models were trained with the loss function:\nL = cE\nn\nX\ni=1\n\u0000E(i)\nREF −ˆE(i)\u00012+cF\nn\nX\ni=1\n\u0000F(i)\nREF −ˆF(i)\u00012\n(C1)\nThe coefficients cE and cF were both set to 100. The optimization was performed using the default\noptimizer in the MACE library with an initial learning rate of 0.001.\n\n\n22\n2.\nFieldSchNet\nAll models used 6 interaction layers with 8-128 channels. A total of 25 Gaussian basis functions\nwere used to featurize each edge. The learning rate was set to 10−4, with a decay factor of 0.8\ntriggered after 25 training epochs without improvement. Both energy and force terms were assigned\na weight of 1.0 in the loss function, in order to get equal emphasis during optimization. Training\ntook place on a single A30 GPU. The training splits used were identical to FieldMACE.\nAppendix D: Excited State Simulations\n1.\nSurface Hopping Molecular Dynamics\nTrajectory surface hopping (TSH) [59, 60, 62, 64] is a nonadiabatic molecular dynamics ap-\nproach where for each time step nuclear motion evolves classically on a single potential energy\nsurface (PES), while stochastic hops between electronic states occur based on nonadiabatic cou-\npling probabilities. In Tully’s fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) [59, 60], electronic state\npopulations are propagated via the time-dependent Schrödinger equation,\nd\ndtck(t) = −\nX\nℓ\n\u0014 i\nℏHkℓ+ dkℓ· v\n\u0015\ncℓ(t),\n(D1)\nwhere ck(t) denotes the time-dependent amplitude of electronic state k, Hkℓis the electronic Hamil-\ntonian matrix element of states k and ℓ, dkℓ= ⟨ϕk|∇R|ϕℓ⟩is the nonadiabatic coupling vector\nbetween states k and ℓ, and v is the nuclear velocity vector. The probability of a hop from state k\nto state ℓin a time step ∆t is computed according to\nPk→ℓ= max\n \n0, 2 Re\n\u0000c∗\nncℓ\n\u0002 i\nℏHkℓ+ dkℓ· v\n\u0003\u0001\n|ck|2\n∆t\n!\n.\n(D2)\nAt every time step, a random variable ξ is drawn from the interval [0, 1], and the system tran-\nsitions from state k to state ℓif ξ is less than Pk→ℓ[59]. Since calculating explicit nonadiabatic\ncouplings dkℓis resource-intensive, alternative methods like curvature-driven surface hopping [78]\nhave emerged. The curvature-driven surface hopping was utilized in all surface hopping simulations\nin this study. These techniques enable efficient propagation of surface hopping trajectories while\naccurately incorporating nonadiabatic effects in simulations of excited-state molecular dynamics.\n\n\n23\n2.\nDataset Details\nThe excited-state data set contains calculations of furan solvated in water (Zenodo archive\n10.5281/zenodo.14536036) and was produced for an ML/MM study using FieldSchNet [39]. Com-\nputational details are briefly summarized here: The furan molecule is solvated in a cubix box (side\nlength 15 Å) of TIP3P water (1365 molecules). Initial structures for surface hopping dynamics\nwere obtained from classical MD simulations. These frames were split into two sets for subsequent\nexcited-state QM/MM simulations. One set contains the initial conditions for trajectories used for\nmodel training and validation, the other was used to compare dynamics of the trained model to\nunseen QM/MM simulations. We followed the same scheme to train and evaluate our models. For\nmore details on the initial conditions generation see [39].\n3.\nSimulation and Training Details\nAll nonadiabatic simulations were conducted using an interface between FieldMACE and the\nSHARC engine [62, 63]. For the transfer learning experiments, the short-range blocks were initial-\nized using the medium-size foundational MACE-OFF model parameters. The other blocks, such as\nthe long-range blocks and the readouts, were randomly initialized. Hyperparameters listed below\nwere kept consistent for both the full data set and the smaller subsets used in transfer learning.\nThese smaller datasets were constructed by taking the relevant amount of data randomly from\nthe full dataset. A 5 Ågstrom cutoff radius was applied along with 8 equally spaced Bessel basis\nfunctions. Only two interaction layers were used, with 128 channels and spherical harmonics up to\ndegree 3. The initial vectors for the MM atoms were constructed from spherical harmonics up to\ndegree 3, combined with an embedding vector of up to size 16. The readout functions were modified\nto produce multiple outputs rather than a single node. In this case 3 states were used.\nThe loss function was defined as mean squared error over all states for a property (energy and\nforces)\nL = cE\nnL\nnL\nX\nj=1\nn\nX\ni=1\n\u0000E(i,j)\nREF −ˆE(i,j)\u00012\n+ cF\nnL\nnL\nX\nj=1\nn\nX\ni=1\n\u0000F(i,j)\nREF −ˆF(i,j)\u00012\n(D3)\nwhere cE and cF were both set to 100. The parameter nL represents the number of energy states,\nhere 3. For optimization we used the default optimizer in the MACE library with a learning rate\n\n\n24\nof 0.001. Training was performed on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. Full details of the parameters\nused for the SHARC simulations can be found in [39].\n\n\n"}
{"text": "Fast and Accurate Gigapixel Pathological Image Classification\nwith Hierarchical Distillation Multi-Instance Learning\nJiuyang Dong1,\nJunjun Jiang1*,\nKui Jiang1,\nJiahan Li1 ,\nYongbing Zhang2*\n1Harbin Institute of Technology, 2Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen\n{jiuyang.dong, jiahan.li}@stu.hit.edu.cn,\n{jiangjunjun, jiangkui, ybzhang08}@hit.edu.cn\nAbstract\nAlthough multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in\npathological image classification, it faces the challenge of\nhigh inference costs due to processing numerous patches\nfrom gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs).\nTo address\nthis, we propose HDMIL, a hierarchical distillation multi-\ninstance learning framework that achieves fast and accu-\nrate classification by eliminating irrelevant patches. HD-\nMIL consists of two key components: the dynamic multi-\ninstance network (DMIN) and the lightweight instance\npre-screening network (LIPN). DMIN operates on high-\nresolution WSIs, while LIPN operates on the corresponding\nlow-resolution counterparts. During training, DMIN are\ntrained for WSI classification while generating attention-\nscore-based masks that indicate irrelevant patches. These\nmasks then guide the training of LIPN to predict the rele-\nvance of each low-resolution patch. During testing, LIPN\nfirst determines the useful regions within low-resolution\nWSIs, which indirectly enables us to eliminate irrelevant re-\ngions in high-resolution WSIs, thereby reducing inference\ntime without causing performance degradation. In addition,\nwe further design the first Chebyshev-polynomials-based\nKolmogorov-Arnold classifier in computational pathology,\nwhich enhances the performance of HDMIL through learn-\nable activation layers. Extensive experiments on three pub-\nlic datasets demonstrate that HDMIL outperforms previ-\nous state-of-the-art methods, e.g., achieving improvements\nof 3.13% in AUC while reducing inference time by 28.6%\non the Camelyon16 dataset.\nThe project is available at\nhttps://github.com/JiuyangDong/HDMIL.\n1.

Before being fed into the MIL\nnetworks for classification, all patches need to undergo fea-\nture extraction. Considering that each WSI contains thou-\nsands of patches, the process of WSI cropping and feature\nextraction can be very time-consuming. As shown in Fig. 1,\ndata pre-processing is the primary speed bottleneck, requir-\ning hundreds of times more time than the MIL classifiers.\nMoreover, WSIs often contain redundant patches with min-\nimal contribution to the bag-level classification. For exam-\nple, by adding up the attention scores of only a small frac-\narXiv:2502.21130v2  [cs.CV]  3 Mar 2025\n\n\ntion (about 10%) of the patches in the selected WSI, we can\nobtain 99% of the total attention scores. Therefore, the re-\nmaining patches can be safely considered as irrelevant and\nremoved without affecting the performance.\nBased on the above analysis, a straightforward idea to\nreduce the inference time is discarding irrelevant instances\nbased on attention scores. Unfortunately, existing MIL al-\ngorithms need to extract the features of all cropped patches\nbefore calculating their attention scores, which brings up\nthe “chicken and egg” problem. To accelerate WSI clas-\nsification, Yu et al. proposed SMT [60]. Instead of crop-\nping each WSI into patches, SMT employs cascading vi-\nsion transformer (ViT) blocks to gradually search for “sus-\npicious” areas and ultimately uses only a small area of\nthe entire WSI for classification. As pointed out by Yu et\nal., the classification performance of SMT heavily relies\non accurately identifying potential tumor areas. However,\nthe pathological information provided by the low-resolution\nthumbnails, used as the initial input of SMT, is insufficient,\nwhich can easily lead to inappropriate regions of interest\nbeing focused. Consequently, the accumulation of errors\nresults in inferior classification performance of SMT when\ncompared to other non-accelerated MIL methods.\nIn this paper, we propose a hierarchical distillation multi-\ninstance learning (HDMIL) framework aiming to quickly\nidentify irrelevant patches and thus achieve fast and ac-\ncurate classification.\nDuring training, instance-level fea-\ntures extracted from all cropped patches in the high-\nresolution WSIs are leveraged to train a dynamic multi-\ninstance network (DMIN) with a self-distillation strategy.\nThis self-distillation strategy constrains the teacher and stu-\ndent branches in DMIN, which use all and partial in-\nstances for classification respectively, to obtain consistent\nresults, thus making the student branch selected instances\nnon-irrelevant. Afterwards, we can obtain a binary mask\nfor each instance depending on whether the instance is con-\nsidered relevant to the slide classification. The masks are\nthen utilized to guide the training of a lightweight instance\npre-screening network (LIPN), which learns to identify the\nbinary relevance of each patches in the corresponding low-\nresolution WSIs. During testing, after LIPN indicates irrel-\nevant low-resolution patches, we can determine which high-\nresolution patches can be skipped, thereby saving infer-\nence time. Furthermore, a Chebyshev-polynomials-based\nKolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier is designed for more\naccurate classification, where learnable activation layers\nhave powerful capabilities.\nOverall, this paper makes three key contributions:\n• This paper offers a crucial insight: eliminating irrelevant\ninstances not only speeds up the inference process but\nalso improves the classification performance. This find-\ning challenges the conventional trade-off between speed\nand performance and provides valuable inspiration for fu-\nture research in multi-instance classification.\n• We are the first to propose and apply the Chebyshev-\npolynomials-based\nKolmogorov-Arnold\nclassifier\nto\ncomputational pathology, which can greatly improve the\nclassification performance.\n• Extensive experiments on three public datasets demon-\nstrate the effectiveness of our method. For example, on\nthe Camelyon16 dataset, HDMIL achieves an AUC of\n90.88% and an accuracy of 88.61%, outperforming pre-\nvious best methods by 3.13% and 3.18%, respectively.\nMoreover, the inference time was reduced by 28.6%.\n2. Related Work\nMIL for WSI Classification.\nMIL for WSI classifica-\ntion can be divided into two categories: instance-based and\nembedding-based. Instance-based methods [9, 21, 24, 36,\n39, 42, 63] first classify each instance and then aggregate\nthe predictions using Max-Pooling, Mean-Pooling, or other\npre-defined pooling operations to generate the final bag-\nlevel prediction. Embedding-based methods [10, 19, 27,\n34, 47, 57, 61] use networks to assess the significance of\neach instance and weight all instances accordingly, produc-\ning the bag-level representation for classification. For the\nembedding-based methods, it is observed that different in-\nstances within each WSI have varying contributions to the\nbag-level representation. Building on this observation, we\ndesign the HDMIL framework to achieve fast and accurate\nclassification by selectively removing irrelevant instances.\nDynamic Neural Networks. Dynamic neural networks [4,\n14–18, 28, 30, 51, 56] can adjust their architecture dynam-\nically according to the input data, thereby controlling the\ncomputational redundancy adaptively. In the era of Visual\nTransformers, many studies [31, 37, 43, 48, 53, 62] have\nattempted to improve inference efficiency by reducing to-\nken redundancy. In addition to bridging the gap in the field\nof computational pathology by utilizing dynamic networks\nto reduce instances and speed up inference, our HDMIL\nalso addresses the aforementioned “chicken or egg” prob-\nlem. This problem cannot be resolved using existing dy-\nnamic networks that solely rely on end-to-end training.\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks. Most previous studies [8,\n23, 25, 26, 32, 49] before KAN [33] used the original 2-\nlayer structure to explore the possibility of constructing\nneural networks based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold repre-\nsentation theorem. KAN extended this theorem to networks\nof arbitrary width and depth, exploring its potential as a fun-\ndamental model of “AI+Science”. Subsequent research has\nprimarily focused on improving the integration of KAN into\nvarious tasks [11, 12, 22, 29, 52, 54] or modify its architec-\nture [1, 3, 5, 50, 55, 58]. In this paper, we propose to re-\nplace the spline function in KAN with first-kind Chebyshev\npolynomials to develop a more powerful MIL classifier for\nreal-world pathological image classification.\n\n\n3. Method\nAs illustrated in Fig. 2, our proposed HDMIL framework\nmainly consists of two stages: training and inference. As\nshown in Fig. 2(a), in the training stage, we first employ\na self-distillation training strategy to train the DMIN on\nhigh-resolution WSIs for bag-level classification and in-\ndicating irrelevant regions.\nWith the guidance from the\ntrained DMIN, we perform cross-distillation training to\nget LIPN using low-resolution WSIs, which achieves dis-\ncrimination of the binary importance (important or not) of\neach region with extremely low computational cost. In the\ninference stage, as shown in Fig. 2(b), LIPN relies on low-\nresolution WSIs to quickly identify regions that are irrele-\nvant to classification and discard the corresponding patches\nwithin high-resolution WSIs. Subsequently, the remaining\npatches are fed into the feature extractor and DMIN to gen-\nerate the classification results.\nBefore training, we first pre-process the input data fol-\nlowing the standard procedure for pathological WSIs [34].\nThe dataset {Xi}S\ni=1 comprises S WSI pyramids with slide\nlabels, where each Xi contains a pair of high-resolution\n(20×) and low-resolution (1.25×) WSIs, respectively re-\nferred to as Xi,HR and Xi,LR. It should be noted that WSI\npyramids typically contain WSIs at various magnification\nlevels ranging from 1.25× to 40×, but in this paper only\nthe two representative magnifications are utilized. After re-\nmoving the background regions, we get Ni pairs of 16×16\npatches from Xi,LR and 256×256 patches from Xi,HR.\n3.1. Self-Distillation Training of DMIN\nAs shown in Fig. 2(c), DMIN is designed to classify high-\nresolution WSIs and identify instances irrelevant to the\nbag-level classification. Specifically, DMIN comprises five\nmodules, namely, the projection module, attention module,\nteacher branch, student branch, and CKA classifiers.\nProjection and Attention Module. During training, all\npatches extracted from the high-resolution WSI Xi,HR are\nfed into a pre-trained feature extractor to generate a set of\ninstance-level features Ii,HR. Subsequently, Ii,HR is fed\ninto the projection module for dimensionality reduction,\nproducing a new feature set Fi,HR ∈RNi×Q, where Q de-\nnotes the dimensionality of the reduced features. Then, the\ndimension-reduced Fi,HR is fed into the attention module\nto compute the un-normalized attention scores:\nAi,HR = [ϕ(Fi,HRV ) ⊙σ(Fi,HRU)]W,\n(1)\nwhere ϕ(·) and σ(·) denote the tanh and sigmoid function.\nThe weight matrices U, V , and W are the learnable param-\neters. The attention module here uses the same dual branch\nattention network as CLAM [34]. In the binary classifica-\ntion tasks discussed in this paper, the attention matrices cor-\nresponding to the first and second categories are denoted as\nAi,HR,1 ∈RNi×1 and Ai,HR,2 ∈RNi×1, respectively.\nTeacher Branch. The dimension-reduced Fi,HR is then\nlinearly weighted by the attention matrix for each category\nto produce the bag-level representation, which are used for\nfinal classification:\nEtea\ni,HR,c = φ(Ai,HR,c)⊤⊗Fi,HR,c, c ∈{1, 2}.\n(2)\nHere φ(·) represents the softmax function and Etea\ni,HR,c ∈\nR1×Q denotes the bag-level representation corresponding\nto the c-th category in the teacher branch.\nStudent Branch and Self-Distillation. The student branch\nis designed to compute bag-level representations using only\na subset of instances with larger attention scores, and we\nimpose a constraint to ensure that the bag-level representa-\ntions in the student branch remain as consistent as possible\nwith the representations obtained in the teacher branch us-\ning all the instances. In this way, the attention module is en-\ncouraged to focus more on instances that are important for\nbag-level classification and filters out irrelevant instances.\nHowever, directly using instances with high atten-\ntion scores is a discrete operation, resulting in a non-\ndifferentiable problem during optimization.\nTo address\nthis issue, we employ the Gumbel trick [43] to selectively\nchoose instances with higher attention scores for end-to-end\ntraining. First, we incorporate the Gumbel Noise [18] to\n“sigmoid” the un-normalized attention matrices:\nˆAi,HR,c = σ(Ai,HR,c + G1,c −G2,c\nτ\n), c ∈{1, 2}.\n(3)\nHere σ represents the sigmoid function, G1,c ∈RNi×1 and\nG2,c ∈RNi×1 are two noises matrices randomly sampled\nfrom the Gumbel distribution, and τ is the temperature coef-\nficient. Next, we binarize the “sigmoided” attention scores\nin a differentiable way:\nM j\ni,HR,c = B( ˆAj\ni,HR,c, γ) −D( ˆAj\ni,HR,c) + ˆAj\ni,HR,c, (4)\nwhere M j\ni,HR,c ∈{0, 1} represents the mask value of\nthe j-th instance and γ denotes the threshold as a hyper-\nparameter. B(a, b) here represents the discrete binarization\nfunction, which equals 1 when a is greater than b, and 0 oth-\nerwise. D(·) represents the gradient truncation operation.\nFurthermore, we propose an attention masking mech-\nanism to eliminate the impact of instances with zero mask\nvalues on the bag-level representations:\nEstu\ni,HR,c =\nNi\nX\nj=1\nexp(Aj\ni,HR,c)M j\ni,HR,c\nPNi\ns=1 exp(As\ni,HR,c)M s\ni,HR,c\nF j\ni,HR,c, (5)\nwhere Estu\ni,HR,c ∈R1×Q represents the bag-level represen-\ntation of the c-th class in the student branch.\nCKA Classifier.

Overview of our HDMIL framework. (a) During training, we start by utilize the high-resolution WSI Xi,HR for self-distillation\nof DMIN, enabling it to classify Xi,HR and generate per-instance mask Mi,HR which indicates the relevance of each region to the bag-\nlevel classification. Afterwards we froze DMIN and employ the masks Mi,HR to distill LIPN, which learns the contribution of each region\nusing the low-resolution Xi,LR. (b) During inference, the LIPN can identify which patches within Xi,HR need to be used for classification\nby evaluating Xi,LR. (c) The self-distillation training of DMIN on the high-resolution Xi,HR.\nnetwork to learn nonlinear activation functions instead of\nusing fixed activation functions in the classifier. Specifi-\ncally, we employ the iterative form of K-order Chebyshev\npolynomials to represents the basis functions TK(x):\nTK(x) = 2xTK−1(x) −TK−2(x), K ≥2.\n(6)\nHere x ∈R1×Q represents a bag-level representation,\nwhere the baseline condition are T0(x) = ⃗1 and T1(x) = x.\nBy multiplying the basis functions T(x) by the learnable\ncoefficients Ω∈RQ×O×(K+1), we can get the prediction\nof the classifier Φ(x):\nΦ(x)[o] =\nK\nX\nk=0\nQ\nX\nq=1\nTk(x)[q] ∗Ω[q, o, k],\n(7)\nwhere O represents the dimension of the prediction result.\nSince we use a dual-branch attention module, it’s natural\nto calculate the classification results for the two branches\nindividually, so O is equal to 1, and the predictions of the\nteacher branch and the student branch are:\n(eY tea\ni,HR = [Φ1(ϕ(Etea\ni,HR,1)) ⊕Φ2(ϕ(Etea\ni,HR,2))].\neY stu\ni,HR = [Φ1(ϕ(Estu\ni,HR,1)) ⊕Φ2(ϕ(Estu\ni,HR,2))].\n(8)\nHere ⊕represents the concatenation operation and the tanh\nfunction ϕ maps the input values of the CKA classifiers to\n[−1, 1], ensuring that the inputs meet the requirements of\nthe Chebyshev polynomial.\nHybrid Loss Function. The training objectives of DMIN\nare threefolds: 1) The teacher branch can correctly clas-\nsify Xi,HR; 2) The classification results of the student\nbranch (using partial instances) and teacher branch (us-\ning all instances) should be consistent; 3) The proportion\nof instances selected should be controllable. Specifically,\nwe first use the cross-entropy loss Ltea\ncls to ensure that the\nteacher branch performs accurate classification:\nLtea\ncls = CE(eY tea\ni,HR, Yi),\n(9)\nwhere CE(·) represents the cross entropy loss function and\nYi is the slide-level label of Xi. Next, we constrain the bag-\nlevel representation Estu\ni,HR and classification logit eY stu\ni,HR in\nthe student branch by knowledge distillation:\n(\nLstu\ndis,1 = L2(Estu\ni,HR, Etea\ni,HR),\nLstu\ndis,2 = LKL(eY stu\ni,HR, eY tea\ni,HR).\n(10)\nHere, L2(·) and LKL(·) denote the 2-norm and KL diver-\ngence loss function, respectively. Finally, we constrain the\nproportion of learned relevant instances eri,HR to be close to\na preset retention ratio r:\nLstu\nrate = L2(eri,HR, r).\n(11)\nHere, the j-th instance is considered relevant if either\nM j\ni,HR,1 or M j\ni,HR,2 are not zero. Additionally, we utilize\nthe clustering loss Ltea\nclu proposed in CLAM [34] to optimize\nthe feature space of DMIN. In conclusion, the hybrid loss\nfunction of DMIN is:\nLDMIN = α1Ltea\ncls +α2Ltea\nclu+α3Lstu\ndis,1+α4Lstu\ndis,1+α5Lstu\nrate.\n(12)\n\n\nFor the coefficients of different loss terms, we did not per-\nform hyper-parameter search, but empirically set α1 and α2\nto 0.7 and 0.3 according to CLAM [34], and set α3, α4, and\nα5 to 0.5, 0.5, and 2.0 according to DynamicViT [43].\n3.2. Cross-Distillation Training of LIPN\nAlthough DMIN can successfully identify irrelevant re-\ngions within WSIs, it does not improve the inference speed.\nThis is because DMIN needs to use all patches’ features\ngenerated by the feature extractor to determine which in-\nstances should be discarded.\nHowever, this patch-wise\nfeature extraction is actually the bottleneck for WSI in-\nference speed. To solve this problem, we propose using\nDMIN to distill LIPN, a lightweight instance pre-screening\nnetwork specifically tailored for low-resolution WSIs, as\nshown in Fig. 2(a).\nAfter training, LIPN can quickly\nidentify the irrelevant regions within low-resolution WSIs,\nthereby indirectly indicating the irrelevant patches within\nhigh-resolution WSIs.\nSpecifically, the Ni 16×16 patches obtained from Xi,LR\nare directly fed into LIPN, generating dual-branch predic-\ntion matrices Pi,LR,c, c ∈{1, 2} for the two categories.\nSince these low-resolution patches contain relatively little\ninformation, we do not require LIPN to learn the specific\ncontribution score of each patch to the bag-level classifica-\ntion like DMIN does. On the contrary, it is easier for LIPN\nto learn whether each patch contributes to the bag-level clas-\nsification or not. Therefore, Pi,LR,c is first binarized:\nM j\ni,LR,c = B(P j\ni,LR,c, γ) −D(P j\ni,LR,c) + P j\ni,LR,c. (13)\nNext, Mi,LR,c is forced to be consistent with Mi,HR,c, so\nthat Mi,LR,c can also indicate whether an patch is relevant.\nWhat’s more, the ratio of learned relevant patches eri,LR is\nalso constrained to be close to r. Overall, the hybrid loss\nfunction of LIPN is:\nLLIP N = β1\n2\nX\nc=1\nL1(Mi,LR,,c, Mi,HR,c)\n2\n+β2L2(eri,LR, r).\n(14)\nHere, L1(·) denotes the 1-norm loss function. In our imple-\nmentation, we employed the widely-used ResNet-50 pre-\ntrained on ImageNet as the feature extractor, and used\na lightweight variant of MobileNetV4 [40] for the pre-\nscreening network LIPN. The detailed architecture of LIPN\nis illustrated in the supplementary material.\n3.3. Efficient Inference\nAs shown in Fig. 2(b), our proposed efficient inference pro-\ncess consists of three steps: 1) Cropping all patches from\nXi,LR, with the total number of patches being Ni. 2) Feed-\ning these patches into LIPN to identify regions relevant to\nclassification, generating Mi,LR; 3) Selectively cropping\nrelevant eri,LRNi patches from Xi,HR based on Mi,LR, and\nthen feeding them into the feature extractor and DMIN. Af-\nterwards, we calculate the bag-level representations and the\nfinal classification results using the student branch across\ncategories separately.\n4. Experimental Results\n4.1. Settings\nWe evaluated our proposed algorithm on three public\ndatasets: 1) for breast cancer lymph node metastasis de-\ntection using the Camelyon16 [2] dataset; 2) for lung can-\ncer subtyping using the TCGA-NSCLC dataset; and 3) for\nbreast cancer subtyping using the TCGA-BRCA dataset.\nAll WSIs were pre-processed using tools developed by\nCLAM [34]. All experiments adhered to the principle of\n10-fold Monte Carlo cross-validation. For Camelyon16,\nthe official training set was divided into training and valida-\ntion sets at a 9:1 ratio based on the number of cases in each\nfold, while the official test set was used for testing across all\nfolds. The TCGA-NSCLC and TCGA-BRCA datasets were\nsplit into the training, validation, and test sets in an 8:1:1 ra-\ntio, again based on the number of cases in each fold. The\nimplementation details are in the supplementary material.\n4.2. Comparative Results on Test Sets\nClassification Performance. Table 1 compares the clas-\nsification performance of our proposed HDMIL against\nexisting MIL methods on the Camelyon16 [2], TCGA-\nNSCLC, and TCGA-BRCA test sets.\nHDMIL† means\nusing only DMIN for inference without pre-screening in-\nstances through LIPN. From the table we can find: 1)\nBoth HDMIL† and HDMIL consistently outperform exist-\ning methods across these datasets. 2) When the dataset is\nlarge enough, the speedup brought by HDMIL does not\nmeans a decrease in classification performance. For exam-\nple, the test performance gap between HDMIL† and HD-\nMIL is small on TCGA-NSCLC and TCGA-BRCA, both\nof which contain about 1000 WSIs. Meanwhile, the AUC\nscore of HDMIL decreases slightly on Camelyon16, but is\nstill much better than existing MIL methods. We believe\nthat the performance degradation of HDMIL compared to\nHDMIL† on the Camelyon16 dataset can be primarily at-\ntributed to the small dataset size (less than 400 WSIs), rather\nthan inherent shortcomings of HDMIL itself.\nA further\nanalysis is presented in Sec. 4.5.\nInference Time. From Tab. 1, it is evident that the pro-\ncessing time of HDMIL† is nearly identical to that of ex-\nisting methods since they need to process the same num-\nber of high-resolution patches. However, HDMIL out-\nperforms all other methods, significantly reducing the pro-\ncessing time. Compared to HDMIL†, HDMIL achieves an\ntotal speed improvement of 28.6%, 21.8%, and 7.2% on\nthe three datasets, respectively.

Analysis of the CKA classifier. The 10-fold validation\nperformance on the Camelyon16 dataset are reported.\n4.4. Ablation Study on Validation Sets\nEffect of Each Components. Table 3 presents the impact\nof each module in HDMIL on the classification results. No-\ntably, replacing the conventional linear layer-based classi-\nfier with the proposed CKA classifiers and incorporating\nself-distillation into the DMIN training, both significantly\nimprove the classification performance. In addition, using\nLIPN for instance pre-screening does not result in a obvi-\nous decrease in the classification performance on the vali-\ndation set, slightly differing from the situation on the test\nset in Tab. 1. This will also be discussed in Sec. 4.5. In\nthe following subsections, we analyze the reasons why each\ncomponent works by 10-fold cross-validation experiments.\nCKA Classifier in DMIN. As shown in Tab. 4, we analyze\nthe proposed CKA classifiers from three perspectives: 1)\nthe impact of employing the CKA layer at different posi-\ntions; 2) comparison with other classification layers; and 3)\nthe impact of different Chebyshev polynomial orders K. To\neliminate the impact of other factors, all experiments here\nonly utilize the teacher branch trained on all instances.\n• When using CKA layers as the projection or attention\nmodule, the number of trainable parameters increases dra-\nmatically, accompanied by a significant drop in perfor-\nmance. It seems that our CKA layer is also better at solv-\ning modeling problems in lower dimensional spaces, sim-\nilar to the vanilla KAN [33].\n• When compared with other classifiers such as the FC\nlayer, two-layer MLP, and KA [33] layer, CKA demon-\nstrates superior classification performance. Although FC,\nMLP, and KA can sometimes achieve similar perfor-\nmance to CKA in certain folds, there tends to be a larger\nperformance gap in other folds. Thus, CKA is a more\npowerful and robust classifier.\n• When the Chebyshev polynomial order changes from 4 to\n16, the number of parameters of the entire DMIN does not\nchange much. Nevertheless, there is a noticeable dispar-\nity in classification performance, with the best outcome\nachieved at an order of 12. Further increasing the order\ndoes not lead to better improvements in classification per-\nformance, probably due to the limited training data.\nSelf-Distillation of DMIN. We believe that self-distillation\nenhances the classification performance by enforcing the at-\ntention module to focus on crucial instances, thereby reduc-\ning the impact of irrelevant regions. This can be seen as\na form of “denoising”. To verify this viewpoint, we eval-\nuated the quality of the bags after the “denoising” effect\nof self-distillation by considering three types of instances\nto represent each bag: all instances within each WSI, in-\nstances selected by the trained DMIN, and randomly sam-\npled instances.\nNewly trained Max-Pooling models are\nused to evaluate the quality of these three types of bags\nlike linear probing [7]. As shown in Tab. 5, MIL models\ntrained with instances selected by DMIN outperform mod-\nels trained with randomly sampled instances and even out-\nperform models trained with all instances. This suggests\nthat self-distillation improves the quality of bags for clas-\nsification by instance selection.\nDistillation Methods in LIPN. Table 6 explores the ef-\nfects of different distillation methods when using DMIN\nto distill LIPN.

It can be seen that distilling among\ndiscrete masks yields significantly better results, especially\non the Camelyon16 dataset. This is because low-resolution\npatches lose too much information, in which case learning\nto predict the specific contribution score of each instance\nbecomes challenging for LIPN, compared to learning the\nbinary decision of the instance (keep or discard).\nDistillation\nManner\nCamelyon16 TCGA-NSCLC TCGA-BRCA\nAUC ACC AUC\nACC\nAUC\nACC\nAH →PL 81.70 83.85 95.01\n89.29\n90.49 87.10\nMH →ML 97.64 95.38 95.88\n90.50\n93.27 88.70\nTable 6. Performance of HDMIL on the validation set when us-\ning different distillation methods. AH, PL, MH, and ML are the\nabbreviations for Ai,HR, Pi,LR, Mi,HR, and Mi,LR respectively.\nImpact of the Preset Instance Retention Ratio. We exam-\nine the impact of the preset instance ratio r on the classifi-\ncation performance, actual learned instance retention ratios,\nand inference time, as depicted in Fig. 4: 1) Generally, the\nperformance of HDMIL and HDMIL† exhibits a pattern of\ninitial improvement followed by a decline as r increases.\nThis can be attributed to the fact that when r is small,\nthe scarcity of patches leads to the loss of classification-\nrelated information. Conversely, when r becomes exces-\nsively large, the self-distillation training fails to eliminate\nthe interference caused by irrelevant instances. 2) In addi-\ntion, it can be seen that the instance retention rate actually\nlearned by HDMIL† and HDMIL is roughly equivalent to\nthe preset r. 3) The inference time gradually increases as\nr increases. When r reaches 0.9, the total inference time\nof HDMIL surpasses that of HDMIL† due to the minimal\nnumber of discarded instances and the additional process-\ning time for low-resolution WSIs.\n4.5. Further Analysis: the Impact of Dataset Size\nDespite the performance gap between HDMIL† and HD-\nMIL on the Camelyon16 test set (depicted in Tab. 1), both\nmethods show similar performance on the validation sets\nacross all three datasets (shown in Tab. 3 and Fig. 4).

The impact of the preset instance retention rate r (hyper-\nparameter) on classification performance, actual learned instance\nretention ratio, and inference time (seconds).\nset, is likely attributed to the bias introduced by select-\ning models for evaluation based on their validation perfor-\nmance. This bias can result in suboptimal performance on\nthe test sets, especially when there is a distribution differ-\nence between the validation and test sets, which becomes\nmore pronounced when dealing with smaller datasets.\nTCGA-NSCLC\nTCGA-BRCA\nValid Set\nTest Set\nValid Set\nTest Set\n25%\n100%\n25%\n100%\n25%\n100%\n25%\n100%\n95.84 95.88 95.46 96.35 94.55 93.27 90.06 90.45\nTable 7. The 10-fold average validation and test AUC scores of\nHDMIL, when the number of cases in the validation set is reduced\nto 25% and the cases in the training and test sets are unchanged.\nTo demonstrate our point, we conducted specific ex-\nperiments on TCGA-NSCLC and TCGA-BRCA, as shown\nin Tab. 7. It can found that when the number of cases in the\nvalidation set was reduced to 25% of the original size, the\nperformance of HDMIL on the validation set did not de-\ncrease significantly, while the models selected using these\nvalidation sets performed worse on the test sets. This find-\ning demonstrates that the performance decline of HDMIL\non Camelyon16 can be attributed to the small dataset size\nrather than inherent algorithmic flaws.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper, HDMIL offers a novel approach for acceler-\nating WSI classification while ensuring high classification\naccuracy. By hierarchical-distillation, HDMIL efficiently\n\n\nfilters out irrelevant patches within WSIs, significantly re-\nducing inference time. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat HDMIL outperforms current state-of-the-art methods\nin both classification performance and inference speed. To\nfurther improve MIL efficiency, we will explore strategies\nto alleviate the inference burden on the feature extractor and\nintegrate them with HDMIL in the future.\nReferences\n[1] Alireza Afzal Aghaei.\nrkan: Rational kolmogorov-arnold\nnetworks. arXiv preprint arXiv:2406.14495, 2024. 2\n[2] Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi, Mitko Veta, Paul Johannes\nVan Diest, Bram Van Ginneken, Nico Karssemeijer, Geert\nLitjens, Jeroen AWM Van Der Laak, Meyke Hermsen,\nQuirine F Manson, Maschenka Balkenhol, et al.

We\nexplore this challenge in the traditional offline RL setting, where an agent must\nlearn how to make decisions based on data collected through a stochastic behav-\nior policy. We present Latent Macro Action Planner (L-MAP), which addresses\nthis challenge by learning a set of temporally extended macro-actions through\na state-conditional Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), effec-\ntively reducing action dimensionality. L-MAP employs a (separate) learned prior\nmodel that acts as a latent transition model and allows efficient sampling of plau-\nsible actions. During planning, our approach accounts for stochasticity in both the\nenvironment and the behavior policy by using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS).\nIn offline RL settings, including stochastic continuous control tasks, L-MAP ef-\nficiently searches over discrete latent actions to yield high expected returns. Em-\npirical results demonstrate that L-MAP maintains low decision latency despite\nincreased action dimensionality. Notably, across tasks ranging from continuous\ncontrol with inherently stochastic dynamics to high-dimensional robotic hand ma-\nnipulation, L-MAP significantly outperforms existing model-based methods and\nperforms on-par with strong model-free actor-critic baselines, highlighting the ef-\nfectiveness of the proposed approach in planning in complex and stochastic envi-\nronments with high-dimensional action spaces.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nPlanning-based reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains with dis-\ncrete, low-dimensional action spaces, such as board games and video games (Silver et al., 2017;\nSchrittwieser et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2021), and continuous control tasks (Hubert et al., 2021; Schrit-\ntwieser et al., 2021). However, extending these methods to high-dimensional continuous action\nspaces, especially in stochastic environments, presents significant challenges. Many environments\nare inherently stochastic or appear stochastic to agents with limited capacity to model complex dy-\nnamics. For example, in autonomous driving, the behavior of other vehicles and pedestrians intro-\nduces substantial uncertainty that must be processed in real time (Carvalho et al., 2014; Luo et al.,\n2023a). Recent planning-based offline RL approaches like Trajectory Transformer (Janner et al.,\n2021) face significant latency issues when trying to model and respond to these stochastic behav-\niors (Li et al., 2023). Similarly, in robotic manipulation, sensor noise introduces randomness that\nrequires fast adaptive responses (Yang et al., 2023). In such cases, deterministic models often fail to\ncapture the necessary randomness and intricacies (Antonoglou et al., 2022). Moreover, the vast and\nuncountable nature of continuous action spaces makes traditional planning approaches inefficient\nwhen operating directly in the raw action space (Jiang et al., 2023). These inefficiencies are further\nexacerbated in stochastic settings, leading to “large and long” planning problems where agents must\nmanage numerous continuous variables over extended time horizons. This results in the curse of\ndimensionality and the curse of history, significantly hindering effective decision-making (Hubert\net al., 2021).\n1\narXiv:2502.21186v2  [cs.LG]  3 Mar 2025\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n...\n...\n...\nDecoder\n...\n...\n(a) Planning with Pre-constructing search space\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\nDecision Latency (s)\n52\n56\n60\n64\n68\n72\nPerformance (%)\nHigher Performance\nat Lower Latency\nLower Performance\nat Higher Latency\nVanilla MCTS\nL-MAP\n(b) Decision Latency vs. Performance\nFigure 1: (a) Overview of planning over the pre-constructed search space. (b) As the number of\nMCTS iterations increases (10, 50, 100 from left to right), using a pre-constructed search space with\nMCTS achieves better performance with lower decision latency.\nIn this paper, we posit that planning in such challenging settings could greatly benefit from temporal\nabstractions, i.e., representations of multi-step primitive behaviors such as macro actions (Dietterich,\n2000; Sutton et al., 1999; Barto & Mahadevan, 2003). By leveraging these abstractions, planners\ncan navigate high-dimensional continuous action spaces more efficiently, potentially mitigating the\ncurse of dimensionality and reducing decision-making latency in stochastic environments. This pa-\nper considers the standard setting where an agent can access a set of trajectories (i.e., a sequence\nof state, action, and reward traces) collected through a fixed behavior policy. Given this setting, we\npropose the Latent Macro Action Planner (L-MAP), which constructs a lower dimensional repre-\nsentation of temporally extended primitive actions by using a state-conditioned Vector Quantized\nVariational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) (van den Oord et al., 2017). The encoder integrates the current\nstate and macro-action to generate a discrete latent code. Subsequently, a sequential model (in our\ncase, a Transformer) is employed to autoregressively model the distribution of these latent codes,\nconditioned on the current state (and the behavior policy). This Transformer facilitates a two-step\ninference process: initially, given a state, it enables the sampling of probable latent macro-actions\nunder the behavior policy, effectively acting as a prior policy. Subsequently, conditioned on both\nthe state and the sampled macro-action, it generates subsequent latent codes that encapsulate infor-\nmation about expected returns and potential next states. This dual functionality of the Transformer\nenables efficient exploration of promising action trajectories while forming a compact representation\nof the plausible trajectories during planning.\nAs shown in Fig.1a, leveraging these models, we build a latent search space that serves as a struc-\ntured initialization for planning, encapsulating likely trajectories based on the learned environment\ndynamics. To address stochasticity and optimize decision-making, we integrate Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS) with progressive widening to efficiently navigate this latent space. Initially, the\nsearch concentrates on the prebuilt latent space, facilitating rapid decision-making grounded in\nlearned abstractions. If additional computation time becomes available, we progressively widen\nthe search tree to extend the search beyond the prebuilt latent space incrementally. This dynamic ex-\npansion strategy enables our method to balance rapid planning using learned abstractions with more\nexhaustive exploration when computational resources permit. As shown in Fig.1b, this strategy\nachieves better performance with lower decision latency compared to planning with vanilla MCTS.\nUpon selecting a latent macro-action, we operate in a polling control mode (He et al., 2011; Gabor\net al., 2019) wherein MCTS returns only the first primitive action of the recommended macro-action.\nThis approach allows for recovery from locally suboptimal decisions by performing planning at each\ntime step.\nWe evaluate L-MAP extensively in the offline RL setting across a diverse range of tasks. In stochas-\ntic MuJoCo environments (Rigter et al., 2023), L-MAP consistently outperforms both model-based\nbaselines like Trajectory Transformer (TT) (Janner et al., 2021) and Trajectory Autoencoding Plan-\nner (TAP) (Jiang et al., 2023), as well as model-free methods such as Conservative Q-Learning\n(CQL) (Kumar et al., 2020) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) (Kostrikov et al., 2022). This demon-\n2\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nstrates L-MAP’s robust capability in handling stochastic dynamics. For deterministic MuJoCo tasks,\nL-MAP shows comparable or superior performance to these baselines, highlighting that our planning\napproach effectively accounts for stochasticity in the behavior policy, leading to competitive perfor-\nmance even in deterministic environments. Notably, L-MAP scales effectively to high-dimensional\ntasks, as evidenced by its strong performance on the challenging Adroit hand manipulation tasks.\nFurthermore, L-MAP’s use of temporal abstraction enables lower latency decision-making com-\npared to methods like TT. These results underscore L-MAP’s versatility and effectiveness across\nvarious types of control problems, from stochastic to deterministic environments, and from low to\nhigh-dimensional action spaces.\n2\nPRELIMINARIES\nWe consider a continuous state and action space Markov Decision Process (MDP) defined by\n{S, A, P, r}, where S ⊆Rn is the state space, A ⊆Rl is the action space, P : S × A →∆(S) is\nthe transition function, and r : S × A →R is the reward function. To manage the complexity of\nthese continuous spaces, we introduce macro actions, which are fixed-length sequences of primitive\nactions. A macro action m ∈M is defined as m = ⟨at, . . . , at+L−1⟩, where each ai ∈A and L is\nthe length of the macro action. Our goal is to compute an optimal macro-level policy π∗: S →Pm\nthat maximizes the expected discounted return Eπ [R(s, π(s))].\nTrajectory Representation:\nConsider a trajectory τ of length T\n=\nκ · L (κ\n∈\nN+),\nwhich is composed of a sequence of states st\n∈S, fixed-size macro actions mt\n∈M,\nand corresponding return-to-go estimates Rt\n= PT\ni=t γi−tri, formally represented as τ\n=\n(R1, s1, m1, RL+1, sL+1, mL+1, . . . , R(κ−1)L+1, s(κ−1)L+1, m(κ−1)L+1).\n3\nMETHOD\nPlanning in continuous action space is hard and computationally challenging, and full enumera-\ntion of all possible actions is infeasible. Discretizing the action space is one way to address this\nchallenge, but in practice, enumerating a large set of discrete actions can also be challenging, partic-\nularly for online approaches. Sample-based methods offer an efficient approach for handling large\nand complex domains. These methods sample a subset of actions rather than exhaustively enu-\nmerating all possibilities, reducing computational costs while computing optimal policies or value\nfunctions (Hubert et al., 2021). Building on these insights, we propose the Latent Macro Action\nPlanner (L-MAP), which learns temporal abstractions in the form of macro-actions and plans using\na latent transition model that serves as both a prior policy and a transition model.\n3.1\nDISCRETIZING STATE-MACRO ACTION SEQUENCES WITH VQ-VAE\nA key insight from prior work is that a learned state-conditioned discretization can be used to con-\nstruct a discretization scheme with relatively few discrete actions while maintaining high granular-\nity (Jiang et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023b). As shown in Fig.2, our approach leverages a learned\nstate-conditioned discretization to enable planning in a lower-dimensional discrete space. Specifi-\ncally, our encoder processes sequences of state and macro-actions as input. For example, each token\nis defined as xt = (Rt, st, mt) and its subsequent token as xt+L = (Rt+L, st+L, mt+L). The\nencoder function is defined as:\nfenc (xt = (Rt, st, mt), xt+L = (Rt+L, st+L, mt+L)) = (zt, zt+L),\n(1)\nwhere the transition chunk size is two, resulting in two latent codes assigned per chunk. To elaborate,\nthe encoder first concatenates the input return-to-go estimates, states, and macro actions into two\ntransition vectors. It then applies a sequence model, in our case, a causal Transformer, producing\ntwo latent feature vectors for each chunk of transitions.\nIn stochastic environments, executing the same macro-action m from state s can yield different\nreturns R, introducing variability that complicates the vector quantization in VQ-VAE, i.e., note that\nusing the full token xt = (Rt, st, mt) directly can result in different latent codes z for identical\n(st, mt) pairs solely due to differences in Rt. This challenge can cause the latent space to become\nfragmented and reflect return variability more than the underlying structure of available actions.\n3\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n...\n...\n+\n+\n+\nEnc\nDec\n...\nCodebook\n=\n=\n...\n=\n=\n=\n=\nFigure 2: An overview of our VQ-VAE model that discretizes state-macro action sequences\nConsequently, the agent might overestimate the returns during decision-making by emphasizing\nlatent codes associated with higher observed returns, neglecting the true distribution of the primitive\nactions and their expected returns.\nTo address this issue, we aim to focus the vector quantization process primarily on representations\nof the state s and macro-actions m, while still preserving the ability to reconstruct the return R.\nTo tackle this challenge, our approach involves creating two versions of each token xt: the full\ninput xt = (Rt, st, mt) and a masked version xmask\nt\n= (mask, st, mt), where Rt is masked out. The\nencoder processes both xt and xmask\nt\nto generate two embeddings, ze(xt) and ze(xmask\nt\n), respectively.\nWe use ze(xmask\nt\n) for vector quantization to obtain the quantized latent code zq(xmask\nt\n). To ensure\nthat the codebook embeddings incorporate information from the full input, including Rt, we update\nthe embedding et of the quantized latent code towards ze(xt). We modify the loss function by\nintroducing an additional term that encourages the embedding from the masked input to be close\nto that from the full input. Specifically, we used the embedding from the full input ze(x) as the\nlearning target for the embedding of the masked input ze(xmask). The modified loss function is:\nL = log p(x | zq(xmask)) + ∥sg[ze(x)] −e∥2\n2 + β∥ze(xmask) −sg[e]∥2\n2 + ∥ze(xmask) −ze(x)∥2\n2 (2)\nwhere sg denotes the stopgradient operator and the additional term\n\r\rze(xmask) −ze(x)\n\r\r2\n2 acts as a\nregularizer that aligns the embeddings of the masked and full inputs.\nIncorporating macro-actions within each token is critical, as it enables the model to capture tempo-\nral dependencies across multiple time steps without the need for downsampling. This approach is\nparticularly important in stochastic settings, where downsampling techniques that aggregate states\n(as in Jiang et al. (2023)) can obscure the stochasticity imposed by the environment’s dynamics. The\ndecoder takes the initial state and latent codes as inputs, and outputs the reconstructed trajectories:\nfdec (st, zt, zt+L) = (ˆxt = ( ˆRt, ˆst, ˆmt), ˆxt+L = ( ˆRt+L, ˆst+L, ˆmt+L)).\n(3)\nThe decoding process can be seen as the inverse of the encoding process, except that the initial state\nst is merged into the embeddings of the codes with a linear projection before decoding.\nLatent Transition Model: Following the discretization process, the subsequent step involves mod-\neling sequences of latent codes in an autoregressive manner using a causal Transformer. The Prior\nTransformer is conditioned on the initial state st, achieved by adding the state feature to all token\nembeddings (Jiang et al., 2023). Primarily, it functions as a transition model in the latent space, en-\nabling the sampling of the next latent code zi+1 conditioned on the current code zi and state s. This\ntransition, represented as T : S × Z →Z, implicitly captures the full R × S × M →R × S × M\ntransition in the original space, as each z encodes information about the return-to-go, state and\nmacro-action. Additionally, p(z | s) acts as a prior policy for efficient action sampling, allow-\ning rapid selection of probable macro-actions based on learned behaviors from the offline dataset.\nBy operating in the learned latent space, the model potentially reduces computational complexity\ncompared to modeling transitions in the original state-action space, especially for high-dimensional\nenvironments. The discrete nature of the latent space allows for efficient sampling, which can be\nbeneficial for downstream tasks such as planning.\n4\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n3.2\nPLANNING WITH A LATENT MACRO ACTION MODEL\nPlanning in high-dimensional environments using learned discrete representations introduces un-\ncertainties from multiple sources.\nFirst, the representation learning process introduces uncer-\ntainty due to the non-injective mapping from the high-dimensional state-action space to a lower-\ndimensional latent space. This can result in many-to-one correspondences, where multiple distinct\nhigh-dimensional inputs map to the same latent representation, creating apparent stochasticity even\nin deterministic environments. Second, the environment itself may be inherently stochastic. The\ndetailed analysis of these uncertainty sources is provided in Appendix C.\nWe argue that taking expectations over latent transitions is beneficial in mitigating all these sources\nof uncertainty, regardless of whether the environment is deterministic or stochastic. By considering\nthe expected outcomes over multiple latent transitions, we can average out the randomness intro-\nduced by the non-injective mapping and inherent stochasticity, leading to more reliable planning\ndecisions. This insight applies broadly to planning methods that employ models with non-injective\nmapping characteristics. Building on this insight, we employ Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as\nour planning algorithm to mitigate the impact of stochasticity arising from non-injective mappings\nand potential environmental randomness. MCTS iteratively explores the latent space and takes ex-\npectations over transitions, allowing for robust planning in the presence of uncertainty.\nPre-constructing the Latent Search Space. Our approach leverages a learned latent transition\nmodel to generate and evaluate macro actions for planning efficiently.\nStarting from an initial\nstate s0, we sample M latent codes z, each representing a potential macro action.\nFor each\nsampled latent code z, we sample N subsequent latent codes z′ to simulate possible future tra-\njectories, capturing the outcomes of these macro actions.\nWe obtain the corresponding state-\naction transitions and return estimates by decoding these latent pairs (z, z′) conditioned on s.\n...\n...\n...\nDec\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\nFigure 3:\nPre-construction of the latent\nsearch space by sampling and evaluating la-\ntent macro-action codes, caching the top-\nk candidates, and recursively expanding the\nplanning tree for efficient macro-level plan-\nning.\nTo construct the planning tree efficiently, we cache\nthe initial state s0 along with the top-k latent codes\nz (and their associated information) based on the de-\ncoded returns, where k = λ × M and λ ∈(0, 1]\ncontrols the expansion ratio of the tree. The cached\nlatent codes represent the most promising macro ac-\ntions to consider from the initial state. The latent\ncodes z′ are then decoded to obtain a set of recon-\nstructed tokens, i.e., (R, s, m). For each of these\nstates s, we sample B latent codes z′′, represent-\ning potential macro actions from s (note that B and\nM are exogenously defined hyper-parameters). This\nprocess is recursively applied, allowing us to ex-\npand the planning tree while controlling its growth\nthrough the parameter λ. By focusing on the most\npromising macro actions at each state, we maintain a\ncompact and informative planning structure that ef-\nficiently explores the state-action space at a macro\nlevel.\nSelection. Starting from the cached tree structure,\nMCTS iteratively expands and evaluates nodes, al-\nlowing for a more comprehensive exploration of the\nstate-action space.\nFor each state s in the tree,\nMCTS selects one of the top-k cached latent codes\nz based on the Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees\n(UCT) (Kocsis & Szepesv´ari, 2006): UCT(s, z) =\nQ(s, z) + c\nq\nlog(N(s))\nN(s,z)\nwhere Q(s, z) represents the\nvalue of executing macro action z in state s (estimated through the decoded return-to-go), N(s)\ndenotes the number of times state s has been visited, N(s, z) denotes the number of times macro\nactionz has been chosen in state s, and c is an exploration coefficient.\nProgressively Widening the State Space for Search. Despite these powerful abstraction tech-\nniques, the search space remains challenging due to the underlying high-dimensional nature of the\n5\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\nYes\n...\n...\nNo\nRepeat\nSelection\nExpansion\nBackpropagation\n...\n...\n...\n...\nFigure 4: Illustration of our MCTS process for macro-level planning.

If we were to apply MCTS directly to this ab-\nstracted space, we would encounter two main issues: inefficient utilization of our pre-built search\nspace, with the search potentially diverging prematurely into unexplored regions, and difficulty in\nbuilding sufficiently deep trees for high-quality long-term decision-making, particularly in areas of\nhigh stochasticity or uncertainty (Cou¨etoux et al., 2011). Therefore, we use progressive widening\nto extend MCTS to incrementally expand the search tree. It balances the exploration of new states\nwith the exploitation of already visited states based on two hyperparameters: α ∈[0, 1] and ϵ ∈R+.\nLet |C(s, z)| denote the number of children for the state-action pair (s, z). The key idea is to al-\nternate between adding new child nodes and selecting among existing child nodes, depending on\nthe number of times a state-action pair (s, z) has been visited. A new state is added to the tree if\n|C(s, z)| < ϵ · N(s, z)α, where N(s, z) is the number of times the state-action pair has been visited.\nThe hyperparameter α controls the propensity to select among existing children, with α = 0 lead-\ning to always selecting among existing child and α = 1 leading to vanilla MCTS behavior (always\nadding a new child). In this way, we could enhance our approach by efficiently utilizing the pre-built\nsearch space, prioritizing the exploration of promising macro actions while allowing for incremen-\ntal expansion of the search tree. This technique enables our method to make quick decisions in an\nanytime manner, leveraging the cached information, and further refine the planning tree if additional\ntime is available.\nExpansion. In our approach, the expansion phase differs from standard MCTS by performing par-\nallel expansion of multiple nodes from a leaf node. From the leaf node, a set of B latent codes\n{z(i)}B\ni=1 is sampled, each representing a distinct macro action, drawn from a latent transition model\np(z | s) to ensure diverse action space coverage. For each sampled macro action z(i), N subsequent\nlatent codes {z′(i,j)}N\nj=1 are sampled according to z′(i,j) ∼p(z′ | z(i), s), for j = {1, . . . , N},\nmodeling potential outcomes and capturing the stochastic nature of macro actions. These latent\ntransitions are then decoded to obtain the resulting next states {s′(i,j)}N\nj=1 for each macro action.\nFinally, the search tree is expanded by adding all L child nodes {(s′(i,j), z′(i,j))}N\nj=1 for each macro\naction z(i) to the current leaf node s. This breadth-wise expansion enables simultaneous exploration\nof multiple promising macro actions, enhancing the diversity and comprehensiveness of the search\nand facilitating efficient exploration in complex environments.\nBackpropagation. Following the expansion phase, where multiple macro actions are expanded\nsimultaneously, the backpropagation step updates the estimated Q-values based on the return-to-go\nas shown in Fig.4.\n4\nEXPERIMENTS\nThe empirical evaluation of L-MAP consists of three sets of tasks from D4RL (Fu et al., 2020):\ngym locomotion control, AntMaze, and Adroit. We compare L-MAP to a range of prior offline RL\n6\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nalgorithms, including both model-free actor-critic methods (Kumar et al., 2020; Kostrikov et al.,\n2022) and model-based approaches (Rigter et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Janner et al., 2021).\nOur work is conceptually most related to the Trajectory Transformer (TT; Janner et al. (2021)) and\nthe Trajectory Autoencoding Planner (TAP; Jiang et al. (2023)), which are model-based planning\nmethods that predict and plan in continuous state and action spaces. These two baselines serve as\nour main points of comparison for deterministic environments.\nTo demonstrate L-MAP’s ability to make performant decisions in stochastic environments, we com-\npare it with One Risk to Rule Them All (1R2R; Rigter et al. (2023)), a risk-averse model-based\nalgorithm designed for stochastic domains, and model-free actor-critic methods Conservative Q-\nLearning (CQL; Kumar et al. (2020)) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL; Kostrikov et al. (2022)). We\nevaluate L-MAP on Stochastic MuJoCo tasks (Rigter et al., 2023), which serve as a proof of concept\nin the stochastic continuous control domain.\nWe then test L-MAP on Adroit, which presents a challenge with its high state and action dimen-\nsionality. Finally, we evaluate L-MAP on AntMaze, a sparse-reward continuous-control problem.\nIn this task, L-MAP achieves similar performance to TT, surpassing model-free methods. Through\nthese diverse evaluations, we aim to demonstrate L-MAP’s versatility and effectiveness across dif-\nferent types of control problems, including stochastic environments, high-dimensional spaces, and\nsparse-reward scenarios. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to analyze the impact of key\ncomponents in L-MAP; detailed results of this study can be found in Appendix A.\nHyperparameters As for the L-MAP-specific hyperparameters, we set our macro action length to\n3. The planning horizon in the raw action space is set to 9 for gym locomotion tasks and 15 for\nAdroit tasks. These horizons are either smaller or equal to those used in TT and TAP. Our choice of\nparameters is to ensure a control rate of approximately 10 Hz for locomotion tasks. For each task,\nwe conduct experiments with 3 different training seeds, and each seed is evaluated for 20 episodes.\nStochastic Mujoco On the Stochastic MuJoCo tasks, with results presented in Table 1, L-MAP\nconsistently outperforms the model-based baselines, TAP and TT, across all datasets and en-\nvironments, demonstrating its superior capacity to handle stochasticity in continuous control tasks.\nNotably, L-MAP achieves the highest performance in multiple datasets for both the Hopper and\nWalker2D environments. When compared to 1R2R, a risk-averse model-based algorithm specifi-\ncally designed for stochastic domains, L-MAP shows competitive or superior results in most cases.\nAn exception is the Medium-Replay-High Hopper dataset, where 1R2R attains a higher score. This\nsuggests that while L-MAP exhibits robustness across a variety of stochastic settings, there are spe-\ncific scenarios where risk-averse strategies like 1R2R may hold an advantage. Additionally, L-MAP\ngenerally outperforms the model-free methods, CQL and IQL. However, CQL surpasses L-MAP in\nthe Medium-Expert-Mod Hopper dataset. It is worth noting that L-MAP is the only method among\nall baselines that achieves performance comparable to CQL in this specific setting.\nTable 1: Results for Stochastic MuJoCo.\nModel-Based\nModel-Free\nDataset Type\nEnv\nL-MAP\nTAP\nTT\n1R2R\nCQL\nIQL\nMedium-Expert-Mod\nHopper\n106.11 ± 2.16\n40.86 ± 5.42\n56.10 ± 3.33\n52.19 ± 8.37\n106.17 ± 2.16\n60.61 ± 3.46\nMedium-Expert-Mod\nWalker2D\n93.43 ± 1.41\n91.40 ± 1.42\n80.93 ± 2.60\n56.48 ± 7.51\n91.44 ± 1.44\n86.66 ± 1.84\nMedium-Mod\nHopper\n55.07 ± 3.06\n43.64 ± 2.25\n44.49 ± 2.47\n65.24 ± 3.31\n49.92 ± 3.00\n56.00 ± 3.60\nMedium-Mod\nWalker2D\n52.94 ± 1.57\n44.46 ± 1.82\n43.61 ± 2.15\n65.16 ± 2.84\n49.38 ± 2.02\n48.82 ± 2.31\nMedium-Replay-Mod\nHopper\n52.30 ± 2.65\n38.10 ± 3.22\n37.85 ± 1.19\n22.82 ± 2.08\n40.53 ± 1.52\n49.12 ± 3.38\nMedium-Replay-Mod\nWalker2D\n51.44 ± 1.65\n43.49 ± 2.27\n27.43 ± 3.33\n52.23 ± 2.22\n40.24 ± 1.67\n40.77 ± 2.72\nMedium-Expert-High\nHopper\n66.93 ± 3.46\n37.31 ± 3.66\n58.04 ± 3.60\n37.99 ± 2.71\n68.03 ± 3.94\n44.83 ± 2.58\nMedium-Expert-High\nWalker2D\n97.18 ± 2.08\n91.09 ± 2.78\n50.01 ± 3.51\n32.38 ± 4.55\n83.18 ± 3.70\n68.61 ± 3.33\nMedium-High\nHopper\n55.32 ± 3.56\n43.93 ± 2.66\n41.26 ± 5.53\n33.99 ± 0.92\n45.21 ± 2.97\n49.69 ± 2.47\nMedium-High\nWalker2D\n68.87 ± 2.21\n52.20 ± 2.76\n59.84 ± 5.03\n32.13 ± 4.51\n61.49 ± 3.24\n47.53 ± 3.05\nMedium-Replay-High\nHopper\n58.05 ± 3.36\n48.69 ± 2.97\n39.24 ± 2.16\n68.25 ± 3.78\n51.70 ± 3.09\n43.27 ± 2.78\nMedium-Replay-High\nWalker2D\n65.87 ± 3.07\n55.15 ± 3.29\n16.55 ± 2.17\n65.63 ± 3.41\n50.33 ± 3.88\n45.13 ± 2.38\nMean\n68.63\n52.53\n46.28\n48.71\n61.47\n53.42\nD4RL MuJoCo On the deterministic MuJoCo tasks, particularly when compared to established\nmodel-free approaches such as CQL and IQL, L-MAP demonstrates notable performance in en-\nvironments like Walker2D and Hopper, matching or exceeding these baselines even in dense\nreward scenarios as shown in Table 2.

Furthermore, L-MAP generally outperforms TAP, suggesting that even in determinis-\ntic environments, the expectation-based planning approach proves advantageous by accounting for\nstochasticity in the behavior policy.

Although IQL leads in the Pen\ntask and CQL leads in the Hammer and Relocate tasks, L-MAP maintains competitive results, par-\nticularly surpassing TT and BC in most environments. This suggests that L-MAP effectively utilizes\nsuboptimal data to make robust decisions in complex settings. For the Cloned dataset, which con-\ntains a mix of optimal and suboptimal trajectories, L-MAP secures top performance in the Pen and\nRelocate tasks. In the Expert dataset, comprised of optimal demonstrations, L-MAP attains the\nhighest scores in the Pen and Relocate environments while remaining competitive in the Hammer\nand Door tasks. Overall, L-MAP achieves the highest average score of 51.40 across all datasets and\nenvironments, and 18.79 across non-expert datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in handling vary-\ning levels of data optimality. Furthermore, the experimental results indicate that L-MAP effectively\n1We included Behavior Cloning (BC) as an additional baseline since the original 1R2R method was not\nevaluated for Adroit tasks.\n8\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nmanages the complexities of high-dimensional Adroit environments. Incorporating more action in-\nformation into the single token does not detract from performance; instead, it appears to enhance the\nmodel’s ability to learn nuanced temporal dependencies required for successful task execution.\nAntMaze In the AntMaze environments—a set of sparse-reward continuous-control tasks where an\nagent must navigate a robotic ant to a target location, L-MAP demonstrates strong and competitive\nperformance as shown in Table 4. These tasks are particularly challenging due to the sparse rewards\nand the presence of suboptimal trajectories that lead to various goals other than the target position\nused during testing.\nTable 4: Performance comparison on AntMaze environments. This evaluation demonstrates that our\napproach can achieve comparable performance to TT with a separate Q network, while being more\nefficient during sampling and decision-making.\nDataset Environment\nBC\nCQL\nIQL\nTT (+Q)\nTAP\nL-MAP\nUmaze AntMaze\n54.6\n74.0\n87.5\n100.0 ± 0.0\n78.33 ± 5.32\n93.33 ± 3.22\nMedium-Play AntMaze\n0.0\n61.2\n71.2\n93.3 ± 6.4\n43.33 ± 6.40\n75.00 ± 6.85\nMedium-Diverse AntMaze\n0.0\n53.7\n70.0\n100.0 ± 0.0\n30.00 ± 5.92\n88.33 ± 4.14\nLarge-Play AntMaze\n0.0\n15.8\n39.6\n66.7 ± 12.2\n63.33 ± 6.22\n78.33 ± 5.32\nLarge-Diverse AntMaze\n0.0\n14.9\n47.5\n60.0 ± 12.7\n66.67 ± 6.09\n81.67 ± 5.00\nMean\n10.92\n43.92\n55.16\n84.00\n56.33\n83.33\nSimilar to TAP, our approach integrates goal positions into the observation space, allowing it to\ncondition trajectory generation on specific goals. This conditioning narrows the focus of sampled\ntrajectories towards the target direction, simplifying the planning process. Instead of using the\nIQL critic for value estimation, L-MAP leverages Monte Carlo planning to provide refined value\nestimates. This alternative approach avoids the additional computational cost of sampling with a\nseparate Q-network, as required by TT (+Q).\nOur method achieves an average success rate of 83.33% across all AntMaze environments, which\nis comparable to the 84.00% average of TT (+Q). Notably, L-MAP outperforms TT (+Q) in the\nmore complex Large-Play and Large-Diverse environments, achieving success rates of 78.33% and\n81.67% respectively, compared to TT (+Q)’s 66.7% and 60.0%. This indicates that L-MAP is partic-\nularly effective in larger mazes where navigation complexity is higher. While TT (+Q) attains per-\nfect success rates in smaller environments like Umaze and Medium-Diverse, L-MAP still performs\nexceptionally well with success rates of 93.33% and 88.33% in these settings. This consistency\nsuggests that our method is robust across different scales of environment complexity.\n5\nRELATED WORK\nRecent advancements in reinforcement learning focus on learning temporally extended action prim-\nitives to reduce decision-making horizons and improve learning efficiency. Both model-free and\nmodel-based methods leverage temporal abstraction to manage task complexity.\nModel-free methods such as CompILE (Kipf et al., 2019), RPL (Gupta et al., 2019), OPAL (Ajay\net al., 2021), ACT (Zhao et al., 2023), and PRISE (Zheng et al., 2024) leverage temporal abstraction\nin various ways. For instance, CompILE learns latent codes representing variable-length behavior\nsegments, enabling cross-task generalization. RPL employs a hierarchical policy architecture to\nsimplify long-horizon tasks by decomposing them into sub-policies. OPAL introduces a continuous\nspace of primitive actions to reduce distributional shift in offline RL, enhancing policy robustness.\nPRISE applies sequence compression to learn variable-length action primitives, improving behavior\ncloning by capturing essential behavioral patterns. These approaches demonstrate the versatility\nof temporal abstraction in addressing different challenges in reinforcement learning, particularly in\nmanaging the complexity inherent in sequential decision-making.\nFrom a model-based perspective, recent work has treated reinforcement learning as a sequence mod-\neling problem, utilizing Transformer architectures to model entire trajectories of states, actions, re-\nwards, and values. This approach is exemplified by methods like Trajectory Transformer (TT) (Zhou\net al., 2020), and TAP (Jiang et al., 2023). TAP, in particular, shares conceptual similarities with\n9\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nour proposed method, L-MAP, in its use of efficient planning solutions for complex action spaces.\nThese sequence modeling approaches have shown promise in capturing long-term dependencies and\nhandling the variability in trajectories, but they often face challenges in stochastic environments\nwhere the outcome is not solely determined by the agent’s actions. As highlighted by Paster et al.\n(2022), reinforcement learning via supervised learning methods may replicate suboptimal actions\nthat accidentally led to good outcomes due to environmental randomness. To address this issue, they\nproposed ESPER, a solution inspired by the decision transformer framework (Chen et al., 2021).\nESPER mitigates the influence of stochasticity on policy learning in discrete action spaces by clus-\ntering trajectories and conditioning on average cluster returns.\nFrom a theoretical perspective, several foundational works have studied continuous-space RL via\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. For example, Kim et al. (2021) grounded Q-learning and DQN\nin this theory, characterizing optimal control without explicit optimization, Munos (2000) estab-\nlished convergence results using viscosity solutions, and Han et al. (2017) employed deep learning\nto solve high-dimensional PDEs via backward stochastic differential equations. While providing\ncrucial theoretical foundations, these works focused on deterministic environments or required per-\nfect knowledge about the dynamics of the environment.\nOur approach also has interesting connections to robust RL, though with key distinctions. While\nrobust MDPs (Iyengar, 2005; Nilim & Ghaoui, 2005) deal with varying transition kernels chosen\nadversarially from uncertainty sets, our work focuses on learning and planning with a fixed tran-\nsition kernel in an offline setting where environmental stochasticity is captured through learned\nmodels. Early robust RL addressed planning with known dynamics in tabular settings (Xu & Man-\nnor, 2010), and generalizing to continuous, high-dimensional spaces is challenging (Lim & Autef,\n2019). Our temporal abstraction could complement robust RL by providing structured transition\nfunctions, potentially integrating classical robust RL planning into high-dimensional environments.\nFrom a planning perspective, our work relates to methods like MuZero (Schrittwieser et al., 2020),\nstochastic MuZero (Antonoglou et al., 2022), and Vector Quantized Models for Planning (Ozair\net al., 2021), which primarily operate in discrete action spaces and online settings, limiting their\napplicability to continuous control tasks in offline RL. MuZero Unplugged (Schrittwieser et al.,\n2021) extended MuZero to the offline setting and adapted to low-dimensional continuous action\nspaces using factorized policy representations (Tang & Agrawal, 2020). However, scaling to high-\ndimensional action spaces is challenging due to computational infeasibility and imprecise action\nselection (Luo et al., 2023b). Additionally, MuZero Unplugged focuses on deterministic environ-\nments and may struggle in highly stochastic continuous settings.\nOur method, L-MAP, extends these concepts to high-dimensional continuous action spaces by ef-\nfectively handling stochasticity and complexity. Using an encoder to group similar state-macro-\naction pairs and reconstructing return-to-go estimates via a decoder within the VQ-VAE framework,\nL-MAP captures essential dynamics while abstracting unnecessary details. This approach models\nfuture returns more accurately in stochastic settings. Combined with planning algorithms, L-MAP\nrefines expected return estimates, bridging the gap between temporal abstraction techniques and ro-\nbust performance in stochastic environments. Our latent code representation and transition model\nreduce the need to learn separate policy, dynamics, and value components in the offline setting,\nincreasing planning efficiency and accounting for environmental stochasticity, thereby enhancing\ngeneralization across complex tasks.\n6\nDISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS\nIn conclusion, we introduced the Latent Macro Action Planner (L-MAP), which leverages temporal\nabstractions learned with a state-conditioned VQ-VAE to construct a discrete latent space of macro-\nactions. This approach enables efficient planning in high-dimensional continuous action spaces\nwithin stochastic environments. Future directions include exploring transfer learning to handle new\ntasks, and adapting L-MAP to online learning scenarios through strategies such as risk-averse ex-\nploration (Luo et al., 2024). These enhancements would enable continuous improvement and help\ntackle more complex challenges, ultimately improving generalization and efficiency in complex,\nreal-world settings.\n10\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n7\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis material is based upon work sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant\nCNS-2238815 and by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under the Assured\nNeuro Symbolic Learning and Reasoning program.

Figure 5 summarizes the results from ablation studies conducted on high-noise\nstochastic MuJoCo tasks.\nMacro Action Length\nWe tested macro action lengths L = 1, L = 3, and L = 5 to evaluate their impact on L-MAP’s\nperformance. The highest mean score of 68.7 was achieved with L = 3. Increasing L to 5 reduced\nthe mean score to 64.57, while decreasing it to 1 further dropped it to 59.39. This indicates that\na macro action length of 3 optimally balances temporal abstraction and adaptability. A moderate\nlength allows the model to capture important action sequences while remaining responsive to en-\nvironmental changes. Shorter lengths may fail to model temporal dependencies effectively, while\nlonger lengths may hinder quick adaptation in stochastic environments.\nPlanning Horizon\nWe assessed the effect of planning horizon by varying the number of planning steps in L-MAP.\nReducing the planning horizon to 3 steps (expanding a single latent variable) decreased the mean\nscore to 57.51, compared to 68.7 with the default longer planning horizon. This demonstrates that a\nlonger planning horizon significantly enhances performance by enabling the model to better antici-\npate future events and handle uncertainty in high-noise stochastic environments.\nTree Search Algorithm: UCT vs. pUCT\nWe compared standard UCT and pUCT as tree search algorithms in L-MAP. UCT achieved a mean\nscore of 68.7, slightly outperforming pUCT, which scored 66.4. While both methods are effective,\nUCT performs marginally better in this context. A possible explanation is that pUCT leverages a\nlearned prior policy to guide exploration, making it sensitive to the quality of the prior. If the prior\npolicy is suboptimal, pUCT may be less effective due to this dependency.\nVQ-VAE Loss Function We compared our loss function with the standard loss function without\nmasking (mean scores: 68.7 vs 57.7). Our approach outperforms the standard loss by focusing\nprimarily on state and action during vector quantization. This results in less skewed reconstructed\n16\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nreturns and a more coherent latent space, accurately capturing action and state distributions. Conse-\nquently, the model generates more reliable latent representations for reconstruction.\nProgressive Widening\nWe evaluated the impact of progressive widening on MAP’s performance. Removing progressive\nwidening led to a significant drop in the mean score from 68.70 to 54.77. This substantial decrease\ndemonstrates the importance of controlled state space expansion during planning for a large search\nspace. Progressive widening enables MAP to balance between exploiting existing states in the pre-\nbuilt search space and incrementally adding new states. Without progressive widening, the search\nsuffers from excessive branching, making it difficult to build sufficiently deep trees for meaningful\nplanning in areas of high stochasticity.\nParallel Expansion\nWe assessed the contribution of parallel expansion by comparing L-MAP’s performance with and\nwithout this feature. Removing parallel expansion reduced the mean score from 68.7 to 62.75,\nyielding performance similar to reducing the planning horizon to six steps. This comparison reveals\nthat parallel expansion primarily affects the algorithm’s ability to efficiently explore the search space.\nGiven the same number of MCTS iterations, removing parallel expansion results in less exploration\nof possible trajectories, reducing the algorithm’s planning capability to that of a shorter horizon.\nThis demonstrates that parallel expansion is crucial for maximizing the effectiveness of each MCTS\niteration by enabling broader simultaneous exploration of potential outcomes.\nB\nADDITIONAL STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENT EXPERIMENTS: HIV\nTREATMENT AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE\nTable 5: Results for HIV Treatment and Currency Exchange.\nModel-Based Approaches\nModel-Free Approaches\nEnv\nL-MAP\nTAP\nTT\n1R2R\nCQL\nIQL\nHIV\n59.08 ± 1.96\n54.95 ± 1.98\n54.46 ± 3.30\n56.45 ± 2.17\n59.74 ± 1.11\n34.1 ± 1.2\nCurrency\n106.78 ± 5.00\n89.72 ± 3.90\n79.28 ± 2.61\n78.52 ± 2.08\n93.96 ± 1.69\n89.41 ± 2.83\nThe HIV Treatment environment, originally introduced by Ernst et al. (2006), simulates treatment\nplanning where an agent controls two drug types (RTI and PI) in a 6-dimensional state space rep-\nresenting cell and virus concentrations. The stochasticity arises from varying drug efficacy at each\nstep. The Currency Exchange environment, based on the Optimal Liquidation problem (Almgren &\nChriss, 2001; Bao & Liu, 2019), involves converting currency under stochastic exchange rates that\nfollow an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Both environments were adapted by Rigter et al. (2023) to\nthe offline RL setting, with datasets collected using partially trained and random policies respec-\ntively.\nFor the HIV Treatment domain, L-MAP and CQL achieve comparable strong performance (59.08\n± 1.96 and 59.74 ± 1.11 respectively), outperforming other baselines. In the Currency Exchange\nenvironment, L-MAP substantially outperforms all other approaches, achieving a score of 106.78\n± 5.00 compared to the next best performer CQL at 93.96 ± 1.69. This superior performance\ndemonstrates L-MAP’s versatility across different types of stochastic environments.\nC\nLATENT SPACE ANALYSIS\nTo empirically demonstrate the uncertainties introduced by non-injective mappings, behavior pol-\nicy, and environmental stochasticity, we generate heatmaps representing the transition probabil-\nities between latent codes.\nWe focus on the Hopper environment and consider three datasets:\nmedium-expert, medium, and medium-replay, in both deterministic and stochastic settings.\nThe heatmaps are constructed by encoding the state-macro-action pairs into latent codes using our\nlearned representation and visualizing the transition probabilities between these codes.\n17\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n(a) Medium expert\n(b) Medium\n(c) Medium replay\nFigure 6: Heatmaps for Deterministic Hopper Environment (Top 50 Frequent Latent Codes). In\neach heatmap, the intensity of the color at position (i, j) represents the probability of transitioning\nfrom the current latent code zt = i to the next latent code zt+1 = j. The accompanying histograms\ndisplay the frequency of each latent code occurring across the dataset with the learned encoder as\nthe current (zt, right histogram) and next (zt+1, top histogram) codes. The observed spread in the\nheatmaps indicates that, despite the deterministic nature of the environment, transitions from a single\nzt lead to multiple zt+1.\n(a) Medium Expert\n(b) Medium\n(c) Medium Replay\nFigure 7: Heatmaps for Stochastic Hopper Environment (Top 50 Frequent Latent Codes). The ob-\nserved spread in the heatmaps indicates that inherent environmental stochasticity further contributes\nto transitions from a single zt leading to multiple zt+1.\nC.1\nDETERMINISTIC ENVIRONMENT HEATMAPS\nIn analyzing the heatmaps for deterministic environments as shown in Fig. 6, it becomes evident\nthat transitions from a current latent code zt to multiple next latent codes zt+1 are not strictly deter-\nministic. This observed spread in transitions originates from two primary sources: the non-injective\nnature of the learned representation and the stochasticity of the behavior policy employed dur-\ning data collection.\nFirst, the non-injective mapping of the encoder function fenc may result in multiple distinct high-\ndimensional state-macro-action pairs being mapped to the same latent code as shown in the his-\ntograms of Fig.6.\nSpecifically, for different state-macro-action pairs x(1)\nt\n= (s(1)\nt , m(1)\nt ) and\nx(2)\nt\n= (s(2)\nt , m(2)\nt ), it is possible that:\nfenc(x(1)\nt ) = fenc(x(2)\nt ) = zt,\neven though x(1)\nt\n̸= x(2)\nt . Consequently, their corresponding next state-macro-action pairs x(1)\nt+1 and\nx(2)\nt+1 may differ, potentially leading to different next latent codes upon encoding:\nz(1)\nt+1 = fenc(x(1)\nt+1),\nz(2)\nt+1 = fenc(x(2)\nt+1),\nwith\nz(1)\nt+1 ̸= z(2)\nt+1.\nSecond, because the behavior policy πb used for data collection may be stochastic, it introduces\nvariability in the selection of macro-actions at both the current and subsequent time steps. Given a\nstate st, the behavior policy determines the macro-action mt as follows:\nmt ∼πb(m | st).\n18\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nThis stochastic selection can result in different macro-actions m(1)\nt\nand m(2)\nt\nbeing chosen from the\nsame state st, which naturally introduces stochasticity. Note that even if the encoder maps both\nx(1)\nt\n= (st, m(1)\nt ) and x(2)\nt\n= (st, m(2)\nt ) to the same latent code zt:\nfenc(x(1)\nt ) = fenc(x(2)\nt ) = zt.\nthe next states s(1)\nt+1 and s(2)\nt+1 might differ, even though the environment dynamics Tenv are determin-\nistic, i.e.,\ns(1)\nt+1 = Tenv(st, m(1)\nt ),\ns(2)\nt+1 = Tenv(st, m(2)\nt ),\nwith\ns(1)\nt+1 ̸= s(2)\nt+1.\nThese different next states lead to different next state-macro-action pairs:\nx(1)\nt+1 = (s(1)\nt+1, m(1)\nt+1),\nx(2)\nt+1 = (s(2)\nt+1, m(2)\nt+1).\nUpon encoding, they may yield different next latent codes:\nz(1)\nt+1 = fenc(x(1)\nt+1),\nz(2)\nt+1 = fenc(x(2)\nt+1),\nwith\nz(1)\nt+1 ̸= z(2)\nt+1.\nTherefore, even in a deterministic environment, the combination of a non-injective encoder and\na stochastic behavior policy introduces variability in the latent transitions. The heatmaps for de-\nterministic environments empirically demonstrate this spread, showing that each zt does not map\ndeterministically to a single zt+1 but rather to a distribution of possible next latent codes.\nC.2\nSTOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENT HEATMAPS\nThe heatmaps for stochastic environments as shown in Fig. 7 exhibit a more pronounced spread in\ntransition probabilities. This inherent environmental stochasticity means that for a given st and mt,\nthere are multiple possible next states st+1, leading to a wider distribution of next latent codes zt+1\nupon encoding. When combined with the non-injective mapping of the encoder and the stochasticity\nof the behavior policy, the uncertainties in the latent transitions are further amplified.\nC.3\nTHE IMPACT OF L1 REGULARIZATION ON REPRESENTATION FIDELITY\n(a) L1 norm\n(b) L2 norm\nFigure 8: Transition Probability Heatmaps for Medium-Replay Datasets from the Stochastic Hopper\nEnvironment (Top 50 Frequent Latent Codes). Left: Heatmap depicting transition probabilities when\nembeddings are regularized using the L1 norm. Right: Heatmap illustrating transition probabilities\nunder L2 norm regularization.\nThe heatmaps shown in Fig.8 reveal distinct patterns between transition probabilities for latent codes\nencoded by encoders trained with L1 and L2 norm regularization in the latent space. The L2 norm\ndemonstrates more distributed transition probabilities, with multiple moderate-probability transi-\ntions (shown as light blue dots) for each current state, indicating the encoder preserves more granu-\nlar information. In contrast, the L1 norm exhibits highly deterministic transitions for certain latent\ncodes, shown by the predominantly dark purple background with the bright yellow spot approach-\ning probability 1.0. This suggests that the encoder trained with L1 regularization tends to collapse\ndissimilar inputs into the same latent code, leading to less nuanced representations.\n19\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nD\nANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE TRENDS WITH INCREASING\nSTOCHASTICITY\nTable 6: Hopper Environment Results with Increasing Stochasticity\nModel-Based\nModel-Free\nDataset Type\nEnv\nL-MAP\nTAP\nTT\n1R2R\nCQL\nIQL\nDeterministic\nMedium-Expert\nHopper\n105.74 ± 2.24\n85.55 ± 3.83\n110.0 ± 2.7\n57.40 ± 6.06\n105.4\n91.5\nMedium\nHopper\n73.90 ± 1.91\n69.14 ± 2.33\n61.1 ± 3.6\n55.49 ± 3.99\n58.0\n66.3\nMedium-Replay\nHopper\n91.18 ± 0.56\n80.92 ± 3.79\n91.5 ± 3.6\n89.67 ± 1.92\n95.0\n94.7\nMean (Deterministic)\n90.27\n78.54\n87.53\n67.52\n86.13\n84.17\nModerate Stochasticity\nMedium-Expert-Mod\nHopper\n106.11 ± 2.16\n40.86 ± 5.42\n56.10 ± 3.33\n52.19 ± 8.37\n106.17 ± 2.16\n60.61 ± 3.46\nMedium-Mod\nHopper\n55.07 ± 3.06\n43.64 ± 2.25\n44.49 ± 2.47\n65.24 ± 3.31\n49.92 ± 3.00\n56.00 ± 3.60\nMedium-Replay-Mod\nHopper\n52.30 ± 2.65\n38.10 ± 3.22\n37.85 ± 1.19\n22.82 ± 2.08\n40.53 ± 1.52\n49.12 ± 3.38\nMean (Moderate Stochasticity)\n71.16\n40.87\n46.15\n46.75\n65.54\n55.24\nHigh Stochasticity\nMedium-Expert-High\nHopper\n66.93 ± 3.46\n37.31 ± 3.66\n58.04 ± 3.60\n37.99 ± 2.71\n68.03 ± 3.94\n44.83 ± 2.58\nMedium-High\nHopper\n55.32 ± 3.56\n43.93 ± 2.66\n41.26 ± 5.53\n33.99 ± 0.92\n45.21 ± 2.97\n49.69 ± 2.47\nMedium-Replay-High\nHopper\n58.05 ± 3.36\n48.69 ± 2.97\n39.24 ± 2.16\n68.25 ± 3.78\n51.70 ± 3.09\n43.27 ± 2.78\nMean (High Stochasticity)\n60.10\n43.31\n46.18\n46.74\n54.98\n45.93\nThis section examines how L-MAP and baseline methods respond to increasing levels of stochas-\nticity in the Hopper environment. Table 6 presents the performance metrics across deterministic,\nmoderate, and high stochasticity settings.\nIn the deterministic setting, L-MAP achieves a mean score of 90.27, indicating strong performance\nand outperforming all other model-based methods. Among the baselines, TT attains a mean of\n87.53, TAP achieves 78.54, and 1R2R scores 67.52. The model-free methods CQL and IQL also\nperform well, with mean scores of 86.13 and 84.17, respectively. The high scores across all methods\nsuggest that the deterministic environment poses minimal challenges, allowing both L-MAP and the\nbaselines to excel.\nAs the environment introduces moderate stochasticity, L-MAP’s mean performance decreases to\n71.16, reflecting a reduction of approximately 21% from its deterministic performance. The model-\nbased baselines experience larger declines; TAP’s mean drops to 40.87 (a 48% reduction), TT’s to\n46.15 (a 47% reduction), and 1R2R’s to 46.75 (a 31% reduction). The model-free methods also\nsuffer performance losses; CQL’s mean decreases to 65.54 (a 24% reduction), and IQL’s to 55.24 (a\n34% reduction). Despite the reductions, L-MAP maintains a higher mean score than all baselines\nin this setting, indicating better resilience to moderate stochasticity among both model-based and\nmodel-free methods.\nIn the setting of high stochasticity, L-MAP’s mean further decreases to 60.10, representing a total\nreduction of about 33% from the deterministic case. The model-based baselines continue to show\ndeclining trends; TAP’s mean falls to 43.31 (a 45% reduction), TT’s to 46.18 (a 47% reduction),\nand 1R2R’s to 46.74 (a 31% reduction). The model-free methods also see further decreases; CQL’s\nmean drops to 54.98 (a 36% reduction), and IQL’s to 45.93 (a 45% reduction). While all methods\nexperience performance degradation, L-MAP consistently outperforms the model-based baselines\nTAP and TT, and maintains an edge over the model-free methods CQL and IQL. The performance\nof L-MAP shows relatively better robustness among the baselines.\nThe overall trend indicates that increasing stochasticity adversely affects all methods, but L-MAP’s\nperformance diminishes at a slower rate compared to the other model-based methods. These results\nsuggest that L-MAP is more robust to stochastic variations in the environment than most of the\nbaseline methods, particularly the model-based ones.\nE\nPLANNING HYPERPARAMETERS\nFor all environments, we utilize the following hyperparameters for sampling during the search pro-\ncess: α = 0.1 and ϵ = 1, which determine the exploration rate of progressive widening; and set\n20\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nthe number of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) iterations to 100.

Torr, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Salman Khan\nAbstract—Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the natural language processing landscape and brought to life diverse\napplications. Pretraining on vast web-scale data has laid the foundation for these models, yet the research community is now\nincreasingly shifting focus toward post-training techniques to achieve further breakthroughs. While pretraining provides a broad\nlinguistic foundation, post-training methods enable LLMs to refine their knowledge, improve reasoning, enhance factual accuracy, and\nalign more effectively with user intents and ethical considerations. Fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and test-time scaling have\nemerged as critical strategies for optimizing LLMs performance, ensuring robustness, and improving adaptability across various\nreal-world tasks. This survey provides a systematic exploration of post-training methodologies, analyzing their role in refining LLMs\nbeyond pretraining, addressing key challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, reward hacking, and inference-time trade-offs. We\nhighlight emerging directions in model alignment, scalable adaptation, and inference-time reasoning, and outline future research\ndirections. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this fast-evolving field:\nhttps://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Awesome-LLM-Post-training.\nIndex Terms—Reasoning Models, Large Language Models, Reinforcement Learning, Reward Modeling, Test-time Scaling\n✦\n1\nIntroduction\nC\nontemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit\nremarkable capabilities across a vast spectrum of tasks,\nencompassing not only text generation [1, 2, 3] and question-\nanswering [4, 5, 6, 7], but also sophisticated multi-step rea-\nsoning [8, 9, 10, 11]. They power applications in natural\nlanguage understanding [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], content gener-\nation [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25], automated reasoning [26,\n27, 28, 29], and multimodal interactions [30, 31, 32, 33]. By\nleveraging vast self-supervised training corpora, these models\noften approximate human-like cognition [34, 35, 36, 37, 38],\ndemonstrating impressive adaptability in real-world settings.\nDespite these impressive achievements, LLMs remain prone\nto critical shortcomings. They can generate misleading or\nfactually incorrect content (commonly referred to as “hal-\nlucinations”) and may struggle to maintain logical consis-\ntency throughout extended discourse [41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46].\nMoreover, the concept of reasoning in LLMs remains a topic\nof debate. While these models can produce responses that\nappear logically coherent, their reasoning is fundamentally\ndistinct from human-like logical inference [47, 34, 48, 49].\nThis distinction is crucial, as it helps explain why LLMs can\n•\n∗Equal\ncontribution.\nCorresponding\nauthors\n(Email:\nko-\nmal.kumar@mbzuai.ac.ae, tajamul.ashraf@mbzuai.ac.ae)\n•\nKomal Kumar, Tajamul Ashraf, Omkar Thawakar, Rao Muham-\nmad Anwer, Hisham Cholakkal, Salman Khan and Fahad Shahbaz\nKhan are with Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intel-\nligence, Abu Dhabi, UAE.\n•\nMubarak Shah is with the Center for Research in Computer Vision\nat the University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL 32816, USA.\n•\nMing-Hsuan Yang is with the University of California at Merced,\nMerced, CA 95343 USA, and also with Google DeepMind, Moun-\ntain View, CA 94043, USA.\n•\nPhilip H.S.

We summarize the key\ntechniques used in recent LLM models, such as GPT-4 [39],\nLLaMA 3.3 [13], and Deepseek R1 [40].\nproduce compelling outputs while still stumbling on relatively\nsimple logical tasks. Unlike symbolic reasoning that manipu-\nlates explicit rules and facts, LLMs operate in an implicit and\nprobabilistic manner [50, 42, 51]. For the scope of this work,\narXiv:2502.21321v1  [cs.CL]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\n2\n‘reasoning’ in LLMs refers to their ability to generate logically\ncoherent responses based on statistical patterns in data rather\nthan explicit logical inference or symbolic manipulation. Ad-\nditionally, models trained purely via next-token prediction\ncan fail to align with user expectations or ethical standards,\nespecially in ambiguous or malicious scenarios [4, 52]. These\nissues underscore the need for specialized strategies that ad-\ndress reliability, bias, and context sensitivity in LLM outputs.\nLLMs training can be broadly categorized into two stages:\npre-training, which generally relies on a next-token prediction\nobjective over large-scale corpora, and post-training, encom-\npassing multiple rounds of fine-tuning and alignment. Post-\ntraining mechanisms aim to mitigate LLMs limitations by\nrefining model behavior and aligning outputs with human\nintent, mitigating biases or inaccuracies [53].\nAdapting LLMs to domain-specific tasks often involves\ntechniques like fine-tuning [54, 55, 56], which enables task-\nspecific learning but risks overfitting and incurs high com-\nputational costs. To address these challenges, approaches\nsuch as Reinforcement Learning (RL) [57, 58, 59] enhance\nadaptability by leveraging dynamic feedback and optimizing\nsequential decision-making. Additionally, advances in scal-\ning techniques, including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [60],\nadapters, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [61,\n62, 63], improve both computational efficiency and factual\naccuracy. These strategies, coupled with distributed train-\ning frameworks, facilitate large-scale deployment and further\nboost the usability of LLMs across diverse applications (Fig-\nure 1). Through these targeted post-training interventions,\nLLMs become better aligned with human intent and ethical\nrequirements, ultimately enhancing their real-world applica-\nbility. Below, we summarize key post-training stages.\na) Fine-Tuning in LLMs: Fine-tuning adapts pre-trained\nLLMs to specific tasks or domains by updating parameters on\ncurated datasets [64, 65, 66, 54, 55, 67, 56]. While LLMs gen-\neralize well after large-scale pretraining, fine-tuning enhances\nperformance in tasks like sentiment analysis [68, 69], question\nanswering, and domain-specific applications such as medical\ndiagnosis [70, 71, 72]. This process, typically supervised,\naligns models with task requirements but poses challenges like\noverfitting, high computational costs, and sensitivity to data\nbiases [56, 31, 16]. To this end, parameter-efficient techniques\nlike LoRA [60] and adapters learn task-specific adaptation by\nupdating explicit parameters, significantly reducing compu-\ntational overhead. As models specialize, they may struggle\nwith out-of-domain generalization, underscoring the trade-off\nbetween specificity and versatility.\nFine-tuning tailors LLMs for specific tasks,\nimproving performance but risking overfitting,\nhigh compute costs, and reduced generalization.\nb) Reinforcement Learning in LLMs: In conventional RL,\nan agent interacts with a structured environment, taking\ndiscrete actions to transition between states while maximiz-\ning cumulative rewards [73]. RL domains—such as robotics,\nboard games, and control systems—feature well-defined state-\naction spaces and clear objectives [74, 75]. RL in LLMs differs\nsignificantly. Instead of a finite action set, LLMs select tokens\nfrom a vast vocabulary, and their evolving state comprises an\never-growing text sequence [16, 59, 76, 57]. This complicates\nplanning and credit assignment, as the impact of token se-\nlection may only emerge later. Feedback in language-based\nRL is also sparse [77], subjective, and delayed, relying on\nheuristic evaluations and user preferences rather than clear\nperformance metrics [78, 79, 58]. Additionally, LLMs must\nbalance multiple, sometimes conflicting, objectives, unlike\nconventional RL, which typically optimizes for a single goal.\nHybrid approaches combining process-based rewards (e.g.,\nchain-of-thought reasoning) with outcome-based evaluations\n(e.g., response quality) help refine learning [8, 80, 81]. Thus,\nRL for LLMs requires specialized optimization techniques to\nhandle high-dimensional outputs, non-stationary objectives,\nand complex reward structures, ensuring responses remain\ncontextually relevant and aligned with user expectations.\nReinforcement in LLMs extends beyond con-\nventional RL as it navigates vast action spaces,\nhandles subjective and delayed rewards, and bal-\nances multiple objectives, necessitating special-\nized optimization techniques.\nc) Scaling in LLMs: Scaling is crucial for enhancing the\nperformance and efficiency of LLMs. It helps improve general-\nization across tasks but introduces significant computational\nchallenges [82, 83]. Balancing performance and resource ef-\nficiency requires targeted strategies at inference. Techniques\nlike CoT [8] reasoning and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) [84] frame-\nworks enhance multi-step reasoning by breaking down com-\nplex problems into sequential or tree-structured steps. Addi-\ntionally, search-based techniques[85, 86, 87, 88] enable itera-\ntive exploration of possible outputs, helping refine responses\nand ensure higher factual accuracy. These approaches, com-\nbined with methods like LoRA [60], adapters, and RAG [61,\n62, 89], optimize the model’s ability to handle complex,\ndomain-specific tasks at scale. RAG enhances factual accu-\nracy by dynamically retrieving external knowledge, mitigating\nlimitations of static training data [62, 24, 90]. Distributed\ntraining frameworks leverage parallel processing to manage\nthe high computational demands of large-scale models. Test-\ntime scaling optimizes inference by adjusting parameters dy-\nnamically based on task complexity [83, 91]. Modifying depth,\nwidth, or active layers balances computational efficiency and\noutput quality, making it valuable in resource-limited or\nvariable conditions. Despite advancements, scaling presents\nchallenges such as diminishing returns, longer inference times,\nand environmental impact, especially when search techniques\nare performed at test time rather than during training [82].\nEnsuring accessibility and feasibility is essential to maintain\nhigh-quality, efficient LLM deployment.\nTest-time scaling enhances the adaptability\nof LLMs by dynamically adjusting computational\nresources during inference.\n1.1\nPrior Surveys\nRecent surveys on RL and LLMs provide valuable insights\nbut often focus on specific aspects, leaving key post-training\n\n\n3\ncomponents underexplored [51, 92, 93, 94]. Many works ex-\namine RL techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Hu-\nman Feedback (RLHF) [58], Reinforcement Learning from AI\nFeedback (RLAIF) [95], and Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) [57], yet they overlook fine-tuning, scaling, and critical\nbenchmarks essential for real-world applications. Further-\nmore, these studies has not explored the potential of RL even\nwithout human annotation supervised finetuning in various\nframeworks such as DeepSeek R1 with GRPO [59]. Other sur-\nveys explore LLMs in traditional RL tasks, such as multi-task\nlearning and decision-making, but they primarily classify LLM\nfunctionalities rather than addressing test-time scaling and\nintegrated post-training strategies [96, 97]. Similarly, studies\non LLM reasoning [98, 99, 100, 55, 101, 102, 103, 104] discuss\nlearning-to-reason techniques but lack structured guidance\non combining fine-tuning, RL, and scaling. The absence of\ntutorials, along with reviews of software libraries and imple-\nmentation tools, further limits their practicality. In contrast,\nthis survey offers a comprehensive view of LLM post-training as\nshown in Figure 1 by systematically covering fine-tuning, RL,\nand scaling as interconnected optimization strategies. We offer\npractical resources—benchmarks, datasets, and tutorials—to\naid LLM refinement for real-world applications.\n1.2\nContributions\nThe key contributions of this survey are as follows:\n• We provide a comprehensive and systematic review of\npost-training methodologies for LLMs, covering fine-\ntuning, RL, and scaling as integral components of model\noptimization.\n• We offer a structured taxonomy of post-training tech-\nniques, clarifying their roles and interconnections, and\npresent insights into open challenges and future research\ndirections in optimizing LLMs for real-world deployment.\n• Our survey provides practical guidance by introducing\nkey benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation metrics\nessential for assessing post-training effectiveness, ensur-\ning a structured framework for real-world applications.\n2\nBackground\nThe LLMs have transformed reasoning by learning to predict\nthe next token in a sequence based on vast amounts of text\ndata [105, 4] using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)\n[106, 3, 107], which maximizes the probability of generating\nthe correct sequence given an input. This is achieved by\nminimizing the negative log-likelihood:\nLMLE =\nT\nX\nt=1\nlog Pθ(yt | y<t, X).\nHere, X represents the input, such as a prompt or context.\nY = (y1, y2, ..., yT ) is the corresponding target sequence, and\nPθ(yt | y<t, X) denotes the model’s predicted probability for\ntoken yt, given preceding tokens.\nToken-wise training can ensure fluency but\nmay cause cascading errors due to uncorrected\nmistakes in inference.\nAs these models scale, they exhibit emergent reasoning\nabilities, particularly when trained on diverse data that in-\nclude code and mathematical content [108, 8]. However, de-\nspite their impressive capabilities, LLMs struggle to maintain\ncoherence and contextual relevance over long sequences. Ad-\ndressing these limitations necessitates a structured approach\nto sequence generation, which naturally aligns with RL.\nSince LLMs generate text autoregressively—where each to-\nken prediction depends on previously generated tokens—this\nprocess can be modeled as a sequential decision-making prob-\nlem within a Markov Decision Process (MDP) [109]. In this set-\nting, the state st represents the sequence of tokens generated\nso far, the action at is the next token, and a reward R(st, at)\nevaluates the quality of the output. An LLM ’s policy πθ is\noptimized to maximize the expected return:\nJ(πθ) = E\nh ∞\nX\nt=0\nγtR(st, at)\ni\n,\nwhere γ is the discount factor that determines how strongly\nfuture rewards influence current decisions. A higher γ places\ngreater importance on long-term rewards. The primary ob-\njective in RL is to learn a policy that maximizes the ex-\npected cumulative reward, often referred to as the return.\nThis requires balancing exploration—trying new actions to\ndiscover their effects—and exploitation—leveraging known\nactions that yield high rewards. While LLMs optimize a like-\nlihood function using static data, RL instead optimizes the\nexpected return through dynamic interactions. To ensure that\nLLMs generate responses that are not only statistically likely\nbut also aligned with human preferences, it is essential to go\nbeyond static optimization methods. While likelihood-based\ntraining captures patterns from vast corpora, it lacks the\nadaptability needed for refining decision-making in interactive\nsettings. By leveraging structured approaches to maximizing\nlong-term objectives, models can dynamically adjust their\nstrategies, balancing exploration and exploitation to improve\nreasoning, coherence, and alignment [110, 111, 49, 48].\nLLMs exhibit emergent abilities due to scale,\nwhile RL refines and aligns them for better rea-\nsoning and interaction.\n2.1\nRL based Sequential Reasoning.\nThe chain-of-thought reasoning observed in modern LLMs is\nnaturally framed as an RL problem. In this perspective, each\nintermediate reasoning step is treated as an action contribut-\ning to a final answer. The policy gradient update is given by:\n∇θJ(πθ) = Eτ\n\" T\nX\nt=1\n∇θ log πθ(xt | x1:t−1) A(st, at)\n#\n,\nwhere the advantage function A(st, at) distributes credit to\nindividual steps, ensuring that the overall reasoning process\nis refined through both immediate and delayed rewards.\nSuch formulations, including step-wise reward decomposition\n[112, 113], have been crucial for enhancing the interpretability\nand performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks. In\ntraditional RL formulations, an agent has:\nValue function: V (s) = E\u0002\nfuture return | s\u0003\n,\n\n\n4\nAction-value (Q-) function: Q(s, a) = E\u0002\nfuture return | s, a\u0003\n,\nAdvantage function: A(s, a) = Q(s, a) −V (s).\nIn words, A(s, a) measures how much better or worse it is to\ntake a specific action a in state s compared to what the agent\nwould normally expect (its baseline V (s)).\n2.2\nEarly RL Methods for Language Modeling.\nHere, we briefly overview pioneering methods that laid the\ngroundwork for applying RL to language generation tasks.\nThese initial efforts train a decision-making model (called a\n“policy”) by directly adjusting its parameters to maximize re-\nwards. Some policy gradient approaches are explained below:\nPolicy\nGradient\n(REINFORCE).\nThe\nREINFORCE\nalgo-\nrithm [114, 115] is a method used to improve decision-making\nby adjusting the model’s strategy (policy) based on rewards\nreceived from its actions. Instead of directly learning the best\naction for every situation, the algorithm refines how likely dif-\nferent actions are to be chosen, gradually improving outcomes\nover time. At each step, the model updates its parameters (θ)\nbased on how well its past decisions performed:\nθ ←θ + α\n\u0010\nG −b\n\u0011\nT\nX\nt=1\n∇θ log πθ(at | st).\nHere: G represents the total reward the model accumulates\nover an episode, b is a baseline value that helps reduce\nvariance, making learning more stable, ∇θ log πθ(at | st)\nmeasures how much a small change in θ affects the probability\nof choosing action at given state st, α is the learning rate,\ncontrolling how much the policy updates at each step.\nOptimizing actions based on long-term re-\nwards, rather than immediate outcomes, remains\nfundamental in recent LLMs, enabling explo-\nration of multiple reasoning paths.\nCurriculum Learning with MIXER.. Ranzato et al. [116]\nintroduces a gradual transition from maximum likelihood esti-\nmation (MLE) to RL. The overall loss is a weighted combination:\nL = λ(t) LMLE + \u00001 −λ(t)\u0001\nLRL,\nwhere λ(t) decreases with training time. This curriculum\nhelps the model ease into the RL objective and mitigate the\nmismatch between training and inference.\nSelf-Critical Sequence Training (SCST). SCST [117] re-\nfines the policy gradient method by comparing the model’s\nsampled outputs against its own best (greedy) predictions.\nInstead of using an arbitrary baseline, SCST uses the model’s\nown highest-scoring output, ensuring that updates directly\nimprove performance relative to what the model currently\nconsiders its best response. The gradient update follows:\n∇θJ(πθ) ≈\n\u0010\nr(ys) −r(ˆy)\n\u0011\n∇θ log πθ(ys),\nwhere ys is a sampled sequence, ˆy is the greedy output, and\nr(y) represents an evaluation metric such as BLEU [118] for\ntranslation or CIDEr [119] for image captioning. Since the\nlearning signal is based on the difference r(ys) −r(ˆy), the\nmodel is explicitly trained to generate outputs that score\nhigher than its own baseline under the evaluation metric.\nIf the sampled output outperforms the greedy output, the\nmodel reinforces it; otherwise, it discourages that sequence.\nThis direct feedback loop ensures that training aligns with\nthe desired evaluation criteria rather than just maximizing\nlikelihood. By leveraging the model’s own best predictions\nas a baseline, SCST effectively reduces variance and stabilizes\ntraining while optimizing real-world performance metrics.\nMinimum Risk Training (MRT). MRT [151] directly mini-\nmizes the expected risk over the output distribution. Given a\ntask-specific loss ∆(y, y∗) comparing the generated output y\nwith the reference y∗, the MRT objective is defined as:\nLMRT(θ) =\nX\ny∈Y\npθ(y | x) ∆(y, y∗).\nThis formulation incorporates evaluation metrics (e.g., 1 −\nBLEU) directly into training, enabling fine-grained adjust-\nments of the policy.\nAdvantage Actor-Critic (A2C/A3C). RL methods like\nREINFORCE [114] rely solely on policy gradients, which suf-\nfer from high variance, leading to unstable and inefficient\nlearning. Since the reward signal fluctuates across different\ntrajectories, updates may be noisy, causing slow or erratic\nconvergence. To mitigate this, Actor-Critic methods [152, 153,\n154, 155] combine two components: an actor and a critic. The\nactor is a policy πθ(at | st) that selects actions at at state\nst, while the critic is a value function Vϕ(st) that evaluates\nthe expected return of a state. The critic provides a more\nstable learning signal, reducing variance in policy updates\nand enabling efficient learning in continuous action spaces.\nActor updates are guided by the policy gradient theorem,\nwhere the advantage function A(st, at) defined in Sec. 2.1,\ndetermines how much better an action at is compared to the\nexpected value of state st. The policy with the learning rate α\nis updated as:\nθ ←θ + α A(st, at) ∇θ log πθ(at | st).\nMeanwhile, the critic is updated using temporal difference\nlearning, minimizing the squared error between its estimate\nand the actual return:\nϕ ←ϕ −β ∇ϕ\n\u0010\nVϕ(st) −Gt\n\u00112\n.\nwhere β is a learning rate for critic. To enhance stability\nand efficiency, several improvements have been proposed.\nEligibility traces allow learning from recent states, enabling\nfaster convergence. Function approximation with neural net-\nworks ensures effective handling of high-dimensional inputs.\nAdvanced variants such as Natural Gradient methods [156]\nadjust updates using the Fisher Information Matrix, improv-\ning convergence speed.\nA notable early example is Barto’s Actor-Critic model\n[157], where the critic uses a linear function Vϕ(st) and\nthe actor follows a linear policy. Modern methods like A2C\n(Advantage Actor-Critic) [154] and A3C (Asynchronous Ad-\nvantage Actor-Critic) [155] extend this approach by paralleliz-\ning training across multiple environments, leading to faster\nand more stable learning. By leveraging the critic’s value\nestimation, actor-critic methods stabilize learning, improve\nsample efficiency, and accelerate convergence, making them\nmore effective for complex decision-making tasks.\n\n\n5\nRL Enhanced LLMs\nDeveloper\nSource\n# Params\nRL Methods\nFine-Tuning\nArchitecture Type\nModel\nTTS\nDeepSeek-V2 [16]\nDeepseek\nLink\n236B-A21B\nGRPO\nDPO + GRPO\nMoE\nOpen\n✓\nGPT 4.5 [120]\nOpenAI\nLink\n-\nRLHF, PPO, RBRM\nSFT + RLHF\nMoE\nClosed\n✓\nGemini [15]\nGoogle\nLink\n-\nRLHF\nSFT + RLHF\nSingle Model\nClosed\n✗\nClaude 3.7 [121]\nAnthropic\nLink\n-\nRLAIF\nSFT + RLAIF\nSingle Model\nClosed\n✗\nReka [122]\nReka\nLink\n7B, 21B\nRLHF, PPO\nSFT + RLHF\nSingle Model\nClosed\n✗\nDeepSeekR1 [40]\nDeepseek\nLink\n240B-A22B\nGRPO\nDPO + GRPO\nMoE\nOpen\n✓\nNemotron-4 340B [123]\nNVIDIA\nLink\n340B\nDPO, RPO\nDPO + RPO\nSingle Model\nClosed\n✗\nFalcon [124]\nTII\nLink\n40B\n-\nSFT\nSingle Model\nOpen\n✗\nGPT-4 [39]\nOpenAI\nLink\n-\nRLHF, PPO, RBRM\nSFT + RLHF\nMoE\nClosed\n✓\nLlama 3 [13]\nMeta\nLink\n8B, 70B, 405B\nDPO\nSFT + DPO\nSingle Model\nOpen\n✗\nQwen2 [125]\nAlibaba\nLink\n(0.5-72)B, 57B-A14B\nDPO\nSFT + DPO\nSingle Model\nOpen\n✓\nGemma2 [14]\nGoogle\nLink\n2B, 9B, 27B\nRLHF\nSFT + RLHF\nSingle Model\nOpen\n✗\nStarling-7B [26]\nBerkeley\nLink\n7B\nRLAIF, PPO\nSFT + RLAIF\nSingle Model\nOpen\n✗\nMoshi [126]\nKyutai\nLink\n7B\n-\n-\nMulti-modal\nOpen\n✓\nAthene-70B [127]\nNexusflow\nLink\n70B\nRLHF\nSFT + RLHF\nSingle Model\nOpen\n✗\nGPT-3.5 [39]\nOpenAI\nLink\n3.5B, 175B\nRLHF, PPO\nSFT + RLHF\nMoE\nClosed\n✓\nHermes 3 [128]\nNous\nLink\n8B, 70B, 405B\nDPO\nSFT + DPO\nSingle Model\nOpen\n✗\nZed [129]\nZed AI\nLink\n500B\nRLHF\nRLHF\nMulti-modal\nOpen\n✓\nPaLM 2 [130]\nGoogle\nLink\n-\nRLHF\n-\nSingle Model\nClosed\n✓\nInternLM2 [131]\nSAIL\nLink\n1.8B, 7B, 20B\nRLHF, PPO\nSFT + RLHF\nSingle Model\nClosed\n✗\nSupernova [132]\nNova AI\nLink\n220B\nRLHF\nRLHF\nMulti-modal\nOpen\n✓\nGrok3 [133]\nGrok-3\nLink\n175B\n-\nDPO\nDense\nOpen\n✓\nPixtral [134]\nMistral AI\nLink\n12B, 123B\n-\nPEFT\nMultimodal\nOpen\n✓\nMinimaxtext [135]\nMiniMax\nLink\n456B\n-\nSFT\nSingle Model\nClosed\n✗\nAmazonnova [136]\nAmazon\nLink\n-\nDPO, RLHF, RLAIF\nSFT\nSingle Model\nClosed\n✗\nFugakullm [137]\nFujitsu\nLink\n13B\n-\n-\nSingle Model\nClosed\n✗\nNova [138]\nRubik’s AI\nLink\n-\n-\nSFT\nProprietary\nClosed\n✗\n03 [139]\nOpenAI\nLink\n-\nRL through CoT\nRL through CoT\nSingle Model\nClosed\n✓\nDbrx [140]\nDatabricks\nLink\n136B\n-\nSFT\nSingle Model\nOpen\n✗\nInstruct-GPT [58]\nOpenAI\nLink\n1.3B, 6B, 175B\nRLHF, PPO\nSFT + RLHF\nSingle Model\nClosed\n✗\nOpenassistant [141]\nLAION\nLink\n17B\n-\nSFT\nSingle Model\nOpen\n✗\nChatGLM [142]\nZhipu AI\nLink\n6B, 9B\nChatGLM-RLHF\nSFT + RLHF\nSingle Model\nOpen\n✗\nZephyr [143]\nArgilla\nLink\n141B-A39B\nORPO\nDPO + ORPO\nMoE\nOpen\n✓\nphi-3 [17]\nMicrosoft\nLink\n3.8B, 7B, 14B\nDPO\nSFT + DPO\nSingle Model\nClosed\n✗\nJurassic [144]\nAI21 Labs\nLink\n-\n-\nSFT\nProprietary\nClosed\n✗\nKimi K1.5 [145]\nMoonshot AI\nLink\n150B\n-\nRLHF\nMulti-modal\nOpen\n✓\nPhi-4 [146]\nMicrosoft\nLink\n28B, 70B, 140B\nDPO\nSFT + DPO\nSingle Model\nClosed\n✗\nChameleon [147]\nMeta AI\nLink\n34B\n-\nSFT\nSingle Model\nOpen\n✗\nCerebrasgpt [148]\nCerebras\nLink\n13B\n-\nSFT\nSingle Model\nOpen\n✗\nBloomberggpt [149]\nBloomberg L.P.\nLink\n50B\n-\nSFT\nSingle Model\nClosed\n✗\nChinchilla [150]\nDeepMind\nLink\n70B\nRLHF, PPO\nSFT\nSingle Model\nClosed\n✗\nTABLE 1: An overview of reinforcement learning enhanced LLMs, where the notation ‘141B-A39B’ represents a Mixture of\nExperts (MoE) architecture with a total of 141 billion parameters, out of which 39 billion are actively used during inference.\nConnection\nwith\nModern\nMethods. The aforemen-\ntioned early RL methods—REINFORCE [114], MIXER [116],\nSeqGAN [158], SCST [117], MRT [151], and actor-critic algorithms\nestablished the mathematical foundations for sequential rea-\nsoning in LLMs. These methods provided initial solutions to\nchallenges such as exposure bias and high variance. Mod-\nern techniques such as large-scale RL from Human Feedback\n(RLHF) using PPO [73] and advanced reward models, e.g.,\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [159] build di-\nrectly upon these ideas. By integrating sophisticated reward\nsignals and leveraging efficient policy updates, contemporary\nLLMs achieve improved reasoning, safety, and alignment with\nhuman values and pave the way for robust multi-step reason-\ning and improved quality of generated text. Table 1 provides\nan overview of recent models, including their parameters,\narchitecture types, and the distilled RL methods employed,\nalong with links for easy access.\n3\nReinforced LLMs\nFrom a methodological perspective, the integration of RL into\nLLM reasoning typically follows three core steps:\n1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): Commences with a\npretrained language model that is subsequently refined\non a supervised dataset of high-quality, human-crafted\nexamples. This phase ensures the model acquires a base-\nline compliance with format and style guidelines.\n2) Reward Model (RM) Training: Generated outputs\nfrom the fine-tuned model are collected and subjected\nto human preference labeling. The reward model is then\ntrained to replicate these label-based scores or rankings,\neffectively learning a continuous reward function that\nmaps response text to a scalar value.\n3) RL Fine-Tuning: Finally, the main language model is\noptimized via a policy gradient algorithm most e.g PPO\nto maximize the reward model’s output. By iterating this\nloop, the LLM learns to produce responses that humans\nfind preferable along key dimensions such as accuracy,\nhelpfulness, and stylistic coherence.\n4) Reward Modeling and Alignment: Sophisticated\nreward functions are developed—drawing from human\npreferences, adversarial feedback, or automated met-\nrics—to guide the model toward outputs that are coher-\nent, safe, and contextually appropriate. These rewards\nare critical for effective credit assignment across multi-\nstep reasoning processes.\nEarly approaches to aligning LLMs with human preferences\nleveraged classical RL algorithms, such as PPO [73] and Trust\nRegion Policy Optimization (TRPO) [160], which optimize a\npolicy by maximizing the expected cumulative reward while\nenforcing constraints on policy updates via a surrogate ob-\njective function and KL-divergence regularization [161]. Im-\nproved alternatives to these methods for scalable preference-\nbased optimization have emerged, such as Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) [57, 162] and Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) [159, 59, 16], which reformulate the\nalignment objective as a ranking-based contrastive loss func-\ntion [163] over human-labeled preference data. Unlike PPO\nand TRPO [160], which rely on explicit reward models and\n\n\n6\ncritic networks, DPO and GRPO directly optimize the policy\nby leveraging log-likelihood ratios and group-wise reward\ncomparisons, respectively, eliminating the need for explicit\nvalue function approximation while preserving preference-\nconsistent learning dynamics. This transition from classical\nRL-based alignment to preference-based direct optimization\nintroduces novel formulations such as contrastive ranking loss,\npolicy likelihood ratio regularization, and grouped advantage\nestimation, which are explained in subsequent sections.\n3.1\nReward modeling\nLet X be the space of possible queries (e.g., user prompts). For\neach query x ∈X, we collect one or more candidate responses\n{yj}mx\nj=1 where mx is the number of candidate responses for\nquery x. Typically, these responses are generated by a lan-\nguage model or policy under different sampling or prompting\nconditions. Human annotators provide preference judgments\nfor these responses. These can take various forms:\n• Pairwise preference: For two responses yj and yk to\nthe same query x, an annotator indicates whether yj is\npreferred to yk.\n• Rankings: A partial or total ordering of the candidate\nresponses, e.g. yj1 ≻yj2 ≻· · · ≻yjmx .\nWe denote such human preference data by {rj} for each\nresponse or pair, where rj might be a label, a rank, or an\nindex indicating preference level. The overall dataset D then\nconsists of N annotated examples:\nD =\nn\n(xi, {yi\nj}mi\nj=1, {preferencesi})\noN\ni=1.\nIn practice, a large number of queries x are sampled from\nreal or simulated user requests. Candidate responses {yj}mx\nj=1\nare generated by either sampling from a base language model\nor using beam search or other decoding strategies. Human\nannotators then provide pairwise or ranking feedback on\nwhich responses are better (or worse) according to predefined\ncriteria (e.g., quality, correctness, helpfulness, etc). We train a\nparametric model Rθ(x, y), referred to as the reward model, to\nmap each (query, response) pair (x, y) to a scalar score. The\ngoal is for Rθ to reflect the alignment or preference level, such\nthat:\nRθ : X × Y →R.\nHere Y is the space of all possible responses.\nTo train Rθ, we use the human preference labels in D to\ndefine a suitable ranking-based loss, as explained below.\nI. Bradley–Terry Model (Pairwise). For pairwise pref-\nerences, Bradley-Terry model [164] is often used. Suppose the\ndataset indicates that, for a given query x, human annotators\nprefer yj to yk, we denote it as yj ≻yk. Under Bradley–Terry,\nthe probability of yj being preferred over yk is given by:\nP\u0000yj ≻yk | x; θ\u0001\n=\nexp\u0000Rθ(x, yj)\u0001\nexp\u0000Rθ(x, yj)\u0001\n+ exp\u0000Rθ(x, yk)\u0001.\nWe train Rθ by maximizing the likelihood of observed prefer-\nences (or equivalently minimizing the negative log-likelihood):\nLBT(θ) = −\nX\n(x, yj≻yk) ∈D\nlog P\u0000yj ≻yk | x; θ\u0001\n.\nII. Plackett–Luce Model1 (Rankings). When full or\npartial rankings of m responses are available, i.e.,\nyj1 ≻yj2 ≻· · · ≻yjm,\nthe Plackett–Luce model [165] factorizes the probability of\nthis ranking as:\nP\u0000yj1, . . . , yjm | x; θ\u0001\n=\nm\nY\nℓ=1\nexp\u0000Rθ(x, yjℓ)\u0001\nPm\nk=ℓexp\u0000Rθ(x, yjk)\u0001.\nIts negative log-likelihood is:\nLPL(θ) = −\nX\n(x, rank)∈D\nm\nX\nℓ=1\nlog\n \nexp\u0000Rθ(x, yjℓ)\u0001\nPm\nk=ℓexp\u0000Rθ(x, yjk)\u0001\n!\n.\nIn practice, one minimizes the sum (or average) of the chosen\nranking-based loss over all preference data:\nL(θ) =\n1\n|D|\nX\n(x, {yj}, prefs) ∈D\nLranking\n\u0010\nθ; x, {yj}, prefs\n\u0011\n,\nwhere Lranking could be either LBT or LPL. While the reward\nmodel Rθ(x, y) provides a scalar reward signal reflecting\nhuman preferences, this connects to common RL concepts,\nespecially the advantage function.\nReward modeling uses ranking-based losses\nto learn a function from human preferences for\npolicy optimization.\nReward modeling Types. Rewards can be categorized into\nexplicit and implicit approaches.\n3.1.1\nExplicit Reward Modeling\nExplicit reward modeling defines reward functions directly\nbased on predefined rules, heuristics, or human annotations.\nThis reward structure involves direct, numeric signals from\nhumans or from specialized AI modules trained to approx-\nimate human judgments (e.g., ranking or pairwise compari-\nson). This method can produce precise reward estimates but\nmay be time-consuming or costly at scale. Illustrative use\ncases include ‘red-teaming’ exercises where experts rate the\nseverity of toxic outputs, or domain-specialist tasks in which\ncorrectness must be validated by a subject matter expert.\n3.1.2\nImplicit Reward Modeling\nImplicit reward modeling infers rewards indirectly from ob-\nserved behaviors, interactions, or preference signals, often\nleveraging machine learning techniques to uncover latent re-\nward structures. It derives its signals from user interaction\nmetrics such as upvotes, acceptance rates, click-through pat-\nterns, or session engagement times. While it can accumulate\nvast datasets with minimal overhead, this approach risks\nfostering behaviors that exploit engagement heuristics at the\nexpense of content quality or veracity.\nReward Function. Defining a reward function for text gen-\neration tasks is an ill-posed problem [166, 167]. The existing\nRL methods in LLMs either focus on the generation process\n(Process Reward Modeling) or the outcome (Outcome Reward\nModeling), to shape LLM behaviors. We explain these two\nreward modeling paradigms below.\n1. https://hturner.github.io/PlackettLuce/\n\n\n7\nLLM Post\ntraining\nHuman\nannotation\nPolicy Long CoT\nexamples+SFT\nRelative PO\n Rejection\nSampling & SFT\nRL helpfulness\nalignment PO\nReward\nΔℒ(x, y⁺, y⁻)\nDirect\nOptimization\nPreference\npairs: (x, y⁺, y⁻)\nReference\npolicy SFT\nREINFORCE PO\nSFT\nExpert policy\ndemonstrations\nAdversarial\nReward Signal\nSFT\nReward Model\nTraining\nProximal\nPO\nRegularization\nKL-Divergence\nMultiple paths \nusing policy\nAdvantage\nEstimation\nPPO+KL\nRegularization \nValue Function\nTraining\nV-guided loss\nPO+TTS\nOffline\ntrajectories\nTerminal\nrewards {0,1}\nReasoning and\nActing\nCoT Prompting\nSelf-feedback\nEpisodic\nMemory Agent\nTree of\nThoughts\nSelf-\nconsistency\nKL constraint\nRegularization \nInference time reasoning\nRLHF\nDPO\nRLAIF\nTRPO\nOREO\nGRPO\n§3.2.8\n§3.2.7\n§3.2.5\n§3.2.4\n§3.2.6\n§3.2.3\nFig. 2: Overview of Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning methods, showcasing pathways for enhancing reasoning\ncapabilities through approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, self-feedback, and episodic memory. The diagram\nhighlights multiple reinforcement learning-based optimization techniques, including GRPO, RLHF, DPO, and RLAIF, for fine-\ntuning reasoning models with reward mechanisms and preference-based learning.\n3.1.3\nOutcome Reward Modeling\nMeasures the end result (e.g., whether the final answer is\nfactually correct or solves the user’s query). This model\nis straightforward to implement but may offer limited in-\nsight into how the conclusion was reached. It is prevalent\nin short-response tasks, where the user’s primary concern is\nthe correctness or succinctness of the final statement. For\nlong-response tasks, outcome based reward can lead to credit\nassignment problem, i.e., which specific actions or states lead\nto a particular reward outcome.\n3.1.4\nProcess Reward Modeling\nAssigns feedback at intermediate reasoning steps, incentiviz-\ning coherent, logically consistent, and well-structured chains\nof thought. This approach is particularly valuable for tasks\ninvolving mathematical derivations, legal arguments, or code\ndebugging, in which the path to the answer is as significant\nas the final statement. In such problems, the reward assigned\nat individual steps encourages transparency and robust step-\nby-step reasoning. However, it requires a more complex anno-\ntation process, e.g., requires “gold” reasoning steps or partial\ncredit scoring. Process rewards can be combined with outcome\nrewards for a strong multi-phase training signal.\nPRM with last-step aggregation beats ORM.\n3.1.5\nIterative RL with Adaptive Reward Models\nAdaptive Reward Models is a training methodology designed\nto continuously improve the performance of LLMs by iter-\natively refining the reward models and the policy model.\nThis approach addresses the challenges of reward hacking and\nreward model drift, which can occur when the reward model\nbecomes misaligned with the desired objectives during large-\nscale RL training. The RL process is divided into multiple\niterations, where the model is trained in cycles. After each\niteration, the reward model is updated based on the latest\nmodel behavior and human feedback. The reward model is\nnot static but evolves over time to better align with human\npreferences and task requirements. This adaptation ensures\nthat the reward signals remain accurate and relevant as the\nmodel improves. Repeat the iterative process until the model’s\nperformance plateaus or meets the desired benchmarks. The\nreward model and policy model co-evolve, with each iteration\nbringing them closer to optimal alignment.\n3.2\nPolicy Optimization\nOnce we have a trained reward model Rθ(x, y) that captures\nhuman preferences, we can integrate it into a RL framework to\noptimize a policy πϕ. In essence, we replace (or augment) the\nenvironment’s native reward signal with Rθ(x, y) so that the\nagent focuses on producing responses y that humans prefer for\na given query x.\nIn typical RL notation:\n• Each state s here can be interpreted as the partial dia-\nlogue or partial generation process for the next token (in\nlanguage modeling).\n• Each action a is the next token (or next chunk of text) to\nbe generated.\n• The policy πϕ(a | s) is a conditional distribution over the\nnext token, parameterized by ϕ.\nWe seek to find ϕ that maximizes the expected reward under\nRθ. Concretely, let x be a user query, and let y ∼πϕ(· | x) be\nthe generated response. We aim to solve:\nmax\nϕ\nEx∼X\nh\nEy∼πϕ(· | x)\n\u0002\nRθ(x, y)\u0003i\n.\n\n\n8\nThis means that on average, over user queries x and responses\ny drawn from the policy πϕ, we want the reward model’s score\nRθ(x, y) to be as high as possible.\nPolicy Gradient and Advantage. The modern algorithms\n(e.g., PPO [73], GRPO [59], TRPO [160]) rely on policy gradients.\nFigure 5 presents a structured comparison of the these main\nRL frameworks. Each framework builds upon different princi-\nples for policy learning, reference modeling, and reward com-\nputation. Recall that the advantage function A(s, a) quantifies\nhow much better an action a is than the baseline expected\nreturn V (s). At a high level, we update the policy πϕ in the\ndirection that increases πϕ(a | s) for actions a with positive\nadvantage and decreases it for negative-advantage actions.\nFormally, the advantage At at time t can be written as:\nAt = Q(st, at) −V (st),\nwhere Q(st, at) is the expected future return (sum of future\nrewards, including Rθ) starting from st when taking action at.\nWhen using the reward model Rθ:\n1) We interpret Rθ(x, y) as the immediate or terminal re-\nward for the generated response y.\n2) The policy’s future returns thus factor in how likely\nsubsequent tokens are to be positively scored by Rθ.\n3) The advantage function still captures how much better\na particular generation step is compared to the baseline\nperformance V (st).\nThe reward model learns relative preferences\nrather than absolute scores. This avoids the need\nfor calibrated human ratings and focuses on pair-\nwise comparisons.\n3.2.1\nOdds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO)\nA simplest method ORPO [168] which directly optimizing a\npolicy from pairwise human preferences. Instead of first learn-\ning a separate reward model and then running standard RL,\nORPO updates the policy to increase the likelihood of preferred\nresponses (according to human labels) relative to dispreferred\nones. The key idea is to look at the odds ratio:\nπϕ(yj | x)\nπϕ(yk | x),\nwhere yj is the preferred response and yk is the less-preferred\nresponse for a given query x.\nPairwise Preference Probability. In many direct pref-\nerence approaches (e.g., Bradley–Terry style), one writes\nPϕ\n\u0000yj ≻yk | x\u0001\n= σ\n\u0010\nln πϕ(yj | x)\nπϕ(yk | x)\n\u0011\n=\n1\n1 + exp\n\u0010\nln πϕ(yk|x)\nπϕ(yj|x)\n\u0011,\nwhere σ(·) is the logistic (sigmoid) function. Intuitively, if the\npolicy πϕ assigns higher probability to yj than to yk, the odds\nπϕ(yj|x)\nπϕ(yk|x) exceed 1, making yj more likely to be the preferred\noutcome under the model.\nIn ORPO, one typically defines a negative log-likelihood loss\nfor all pairs {(x, yj ≻yk)} in the dataset:\nLORPO(ϕ) = −\nX\n(x, yj≻yk) ∈D\nlog\n\u0010\nPϕ\n\u0000yj ≻yk | x\u0001\u0011\n.\nSubstituting the logistic form gives:\nLORPO(ϕ) = −\nX\n(x, yj≻yk) ∈D\nlog\n\u0010\nπϕ(yj | x)\nπϕ(yj | x) + πϕ(yk | x)\n\u0011\n,\nwhich can also be interpreted as maximizing the log odds ratio\nfor the correct (preferred) label in each pairwise comparison.\nInterpretation via Odds Ratios. By treating each\npreference label (yj ≻yk) as a constraint on the odds πϕ(yj|x)\nπϕ(yk|x),\nORPO pushes the policy to increase its probability mass on yj\nwhile decreasing it on yk. When viewed in logarithmic space:\nln\n\u0010\nπϕ(yj|x)\nπϕ(yk|x)\n\u0011\n,\na higher value corresponds to a greater likelihood of selecting\nyj over yk. Hence, minimizing LORPO(ϕ) aligns πϕ with the\nhuman-labeled preferences.\n. ORPO is potentially less flexible for combining\nmultiple reward signals.\n3.2.2\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in LLMs\nA popular method for policy optimization is PPO [73], a\nstrategy adapted to align LLMs with human feedback. Given\na policy πθ parameterized by θ and a reward function R,\nPPO updates the policy by optimizing a clipped objective\nthat balances exploration and stability. Specifically, if rt(θ) =\nπθ(at|st)\nπθref(at|st) denotes the probability ratio for an action at in\nstate st, the clipped PPO objective is:\nLPPO(θ) = Et\nh\nmin \u0000rt(θ) At, clip(rt(θ), 1 −ϵ, 1 + ϵ) At\n\u0001i\n,\nwhere At is an estimator of the advantage function and ϵ is a\nhyperparameter controlling the allowable deviation from the\nprevious policy. At is computed using Generalized Advantage\nEstimation (GAE) [169] based on rewards and a learned value\nfunction. The clipping objective of PPO restricts how dras-\ntically the updated policy distribution can diverge from the\noriginal policy. This moderation averts catastrophic shifts in\nlanguage generation and preserves training stability.\nPolicy Optimization with KL Penalty. During RL fine-\ntuning with PPO, the policy π is optimized to maximize reward\nwhile staying close to the base model ρ. The modified reward\nfunction includes a KL divergence penalty:\nJ(π) = E(x,y)∼D\n\u0002\nr(x, y) −β KL\u0000π(·|x) ∥ρ(·|x)\u0001\u0003\n,\nwhere β controls the penalty strength. The KL term KL(π ∥ρ)\nprevents over-optimization to the proxy reward r(x, y) (i.e.,\nreward hacking).\nThe KL penalty ensure policy retains the base\nmodel’s linguistic coherence and avoids degener-\nate outputs.\n3.2.3\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\nRLHF [58] refines LLMs through direct human preference sig-\nnals, making them more aligned with human expectations.\nThe process involves three main steps. First, SFT is performed\non a pretrained model using high-quality labeled data to\nestablish strong linguistic and factual capabilities. Second, a\n\n\n9\nreward function R is trained using human-annotated rankings\nof generated responses, allowing it to predict preferences and\nprovide a scalar reward signal. Third, PPO is employed in the\nRLHF [58] pipeline by using human-provided preference scores\n(or rankings) to shape R and thereby guide the policy up-\ndates. This ensures that the model prioritizes outputs aligned\nwith human-preferred behavior. The robust performance un-\nder conditions of noisy or partial reward signals makes PPO\nwell-suited for text generation tasks, where large action spaces\nand nuanced reward definitions are common.\n3.2.4\nReinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF)\nRLAIF [95] is an alternative to RLHF that replaces human\nannotation with AI-generated feedback. Instead of relying\non human-labeled preferences, RLAIF employs a secondary,\nhighly capable language model to generate preference labels,\nwhich are then used to train a reward model. This reward\nmodel guides reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning of the\ntarget model. RLAIF reduces the cost and time required for\ndata collection by eliminating the need for human annota-\ntors. It enables large-scale model alignment without requiring\nextensive human intervention while maintaining high perfor-\nmance and alignment. Empirical studies indicate that RLAIF\n[95, 170] is a scalable and efficient alternative to RLHF, making\nit a promising direction for reinforcement learning-driven\nlanguage model optimization.\nThe clipping mechanism constrains policy\nupdates to remain within a safe trust region,\nwhich is crucial when dealing with complex, high-\ndimensional action spaces.\n3.2.5\nTrust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)\nTRPO [160] is another widely used policy optimization method,\npreceding PPO and sharing its fundamental goal: improving\nstability in reinforcement learning updates. TRPO optimizes\npolicy updates while ensuring they remain within a con-\nstrained trust region, measured by KL divergence.\nInstead of using a clipped objective like PPO, TRPO enforces\na hard constraint on policy updates by solving the following\noptimization problem:\nmax\nθ\nEt\n\u0014 πθ(at | st)\nπθold(at | st)At\n\u0015\nsubject to the constraint:\nEt [DKL (πθold(· | st)∥πθ(· | st))] ≤δ.\nwhere δ is a hyperparameter that controls how much the new\npolicy can diverge from the old one.\nUnlike PPO, which approximates this constraint using clip-\nping, TRPO directly solves a constrained optimization problem,\nensuring each update does not move too far in policy space.\nHowever, solving this constrained problem requires computa-\ntionally expensive second-order optimization techniques like\nconjugate gradient methods, making TRPO less efficient for\nlarge-scale models like LLMs. In practice, PPO is preferred\nover TRPO due to its simplicity, ease of implementation, and\ncomparable performance in large-scale applications like RLHF.\nHowever, TRPO remains an important theoretical foundation\nfor stable policy optimization in deep reinforcement learning.\nq\nPolicy\no\nReference\nReward\nValue\nr\nv\nGAE\nA\nq\nPolicy\nGroup\nComputation\nReward\nReference\nq\nPolicy\nr\nDPO\nobjective\nReference\nModel\nPreference\nData\nupdate\nback-prop\nPPO\nKL\nKL\nDPO\nGRPO\npreferences\nupdate\nFig. 3: Comparison of PPO [73], GRPO [59], and DPO [162].\nWe highlight policy models, reference models, rewards and\noptimization flows with corresponding loss functions.\n3.2.6\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO)\nDPO [162] is a recently proposed method for training LLMs\nfrom human preference data without resorting to the tradi-\ntional RL loop (as in RLHF with PPO). Instead of learning a\nseparate reward function and then running policy-gradient\nupdates, DPO directly integrates human preference signals into\nthe model’s training objective. So instead of the above PPO\nobjective, DPO instead constructs an objective that directly\npushes up the probability of a chosen (preferred) response\n(y+) while pushing down the probability of a less-preferred\nresponse (y−), all within a single log-likelihood framework.\nRather than bounding policy changes with clip, the DPO loss\nuses the difference between log probabilities of ‘winning’ vs.\n‘losing’ responses. This explicitly encodes the user’s preference\nin the updated parameters.\nHere, πθ is the learnable policy, πref is a reference policy\n(often the SFT-trained model), σ(·) is the sigmoid function,\nβ is a scaling parameter, and Dtrain is a dataset of triplets\n(x, y+, y−) where y+ is the preferred output over y−.\nLDPO(θ) = E((x,y+),y−)∼Dtrain\nh\nσ\n\u0010\nβ log πθ(y+ | x)\nπref(y+ | x)\n−β log πθ(y−| x)\nπref(y−| x)\n\u0011i\n.\nThe key insight is that an LLM can be treated as a “hidden\nreward model”: we can reparameterize preference data so that\nthe model’s own log probabilities reflect how preferable one re-\nsponse is over another. By directly adjusting the log-likelihood\nof more-preferred responses relative to less-preferred ones,\nDPO sidesteps many complexities of RL-based methods (e.g.,\nadvantage functions or explicit clipping).\n\n\n10\nThe advantage function Aϕ = Vϕ(st+1) −Vϕ(st)\nquantifies\nper-step\ncontributions,\ncritical\nfor\nidentifying key reasoning errors. This granularity\nis lost in DPO, which treats entire trajectories\nuniformly.\nPerplexity Filtering for On-Distribution Data. To en-\nsure DPO training data is on-distribution (aligned with ρ),\nresponses are filtered using perplexity. The perplexity of a\nresponse y = (y1, y2, . . . , yT ) is defined as:\nPP(y) = exp\n \n−1\nT\nT\nX\ni=1\nlog Pρ(yi | y<i)\n!\n,\nwhere yi is the i-th token. Only responses with perplexity\nbelow a threshold (e.g., the 95th percentile of ρ-generated\nresponses) are retained.\nThe advantage function remains a core con-\ncept to determine which actions (token choices)\nare better than the baseline at each step.\n3.2.7\nOffline Reasoning Optimization (OREO)\nOREO [171] is an offline reinforcement learning method de-\nsigned to enhance LLMs’ multi-step reasoning by optimizing\nthe soft Bellman equation [109]. Unlike DPO, which relies\non paired preference data, OREO uses sparse rewards based\non final outcomes (e.g., correctness of reasoning chains) and\njointly trains a policy model πθ and a value function Vϕ for\nfine-grained credit assignment. The core objective minimizes\nthe inconsistency in the soft Bellman equation:\nVϕ(st) −Vϕ(st+1) = r(st, at) −β log πθ(at | st)\nπref(at | st),\nwhere st+1 = f(st, at) is the next state, r is the sparse reward,\nand β controls KL regularization. The policy and value losses\nare:\nLV (ϕ) = 1\nT\nT −1\nX\nt=0\n \nVϕ(st) −Rt + β\nX\ni≥t\nlog πθ(ai | si)\nπref(ai | si)\n!2\n,\nLπ(θ) = 1\nT\nT −1\nX\nt=0\n\u0012\nVϕ(st) −Rt + β log πθ(at | st)\nπref(at | st)\n\u00132\n+ αLreg,\nwhere Lreg penalizes deviations from πref, and α balances\nregularization.\nOREO’s explicit value function enables test-\ntime beam search (e.g., selecting high-value rea-\nsoning steps) and iterative training, where failed\ntrajectories refine the policy. This contrasts with\nDPO implicit value function, which lacks stepwise\ncredit assignment.\n. OREO’s computational cost scales with trajec-\ntory length and value-model training. While ef-\nfective for math/agent tasks, its generalization\nto broader domains (e.g., coding) requires vali-\ndation. Iterative training also demands careful\ndata curation to avoid overfitting to failure\nmodes.\n3.2.8\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\nGRPO [59] simplifies the PPO framework by eliminating the\nneed for a separate value function. Instead, GRPO estimates\nthe baseline from the average reward of multiple sampled\noutputs for the same question. The primary contribution in\nGRPO is that it removes the need for a separate value model\n(critic model) and instead estimates the baseline reward from\na group of sampled LLM outputs. This significantly reduces\nmemory usage and stabilizes policy learning. The approach\nalso aligns well with how reward models are trained, i.e.,\nby comparing different LLM-generated outputs rather than\npredicting an absolute value.\nFor each question q, GRPO samples a group of outputs\n{o1, o2, . . . , oG} from the old policy πold\nθ . A reward model\nis used to score each output in the group, yielding rewards\n{r1, r2, . . . , rG}. The rewards are normalized by subtracting\nthe group average and dividing by the standard deviation:\n¯ri = ri −mean(r)\nstd(r)\n.\nThe advantage ˆAi,t for each token in the output is set as the\nnormalized reward ¯ri.\nGRPO first samples a question q ∼P(Q) and then samples\nG outputs {oi}G\ni=1 from πold\nθ (O | q). Define the per-output\nobjective as\nJ(oi, θ, q) =\n1\n|oi|\n|oi|\nX\nt=1\n \nmin\nn\nrratio,i,t ˆAi,t,\nclip\u0000rratio,i,t, 1 −ϵ, 1 + ϵ\u0001 ˆAi,t\no\n−β DKL\nh\nπθ ∥πref\ni!\n.\nThen, the GRPO objective becomes\nJGRP O(θ) = Eq∼P (Q)\n\"\n1\nG\nG\nX\ni=1\nJ(oi, θ, q)\n#\n,\nwhere the probability ratio is defined as\nrratio,i,t ≜πθ(oi,t | q, oi,<t)\nπold\nθ (oi,t | q, oi,<t).\nwhere ϵ is a clipping hyperparameter akin to PPO, and β\nadjusts the KL-divergence penalty encouraging the new policy\nπθ not to deviate excessively from a reference policy πref,\nwhich is typically the initial supervised fine-tuned (SFT)\nmodel [172, 173]. GRPO can be applied in two modes: outcome\nsupervision and process supervision.\nOutcome Supervision: Provides a reward only at the\nend of each output. The advantage ˆAi,t for all tokens in the\noutput is set as the normalized reward ¯ri.\n¯ri = ri −mean(r)\nstd(r)\n.\n\n\n11\nProcess Supervision: Provides a reward at the end of\neach reasoning step. The advantage ˆAi,t for each token is\ncalculated as the sum of the normalized rewards from the\nfollowing steps:\nˆAi,t =\nX\nindex(j)≥t\n¯ri,index(j),\nwhere index(j) is the end token index of the j-th step.\nOverall, GRPO serves as an efficient alternative to classic actor-\ncritic frameworks in DeepSeekR1 [40] by leveraging group-\nlevel advantages, thereby reducing training costs without\nsacrificing the capacity to distinguish fine-grained differences\namong candidate responses.\nFine-grained per-step rewards enable the\nmodel to effectively identify and reinforce high-\nquality responses, boosting overall performance\nin complex, multi-step reasoning tasks.\n3.2.9\nMulti-Sample Comparison Optimization\nInstead of relying solely on single-pair comparisons, multi-\nsample comparison optimization [174] approach compares\nmultiple\nresponses\nsimultaneously\nto\npromote\ndiversity\nand mitigate bias. Specifically, given a set of responses\n{y1, y2, . . . , yn} for a query x, the probability of observing the\nranking y1 > y2 > · · · > yn is determined by the product\nP(y1 > y2 > · · · > yn) =\nY\ni\neR(x,yi)\nP\nj eR(x,yj) .\nIn this formulation, each response yi is jointly evaluated in the\ncontext of all other responses, ensuring that comparisons are\nnot isolated pairwise events but rather part of a broader rank-\ning framework that helps capture more nuanced preferences\nand reduces potential biases.\n3.3\nPure RL Based LLM Refinement\nThe work from Guo et al. (2025) [40] introduces two main\nmodels: DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1.\n• DeepSeek-R1-Zero operates with a purely Reinforce-\nment Learning approach, excluding any SFT.\n• DeepSeek-R1 incorporates cold-start data and applies\na multi-stage training pipeline.\nThe methodology encompasses several steps (See Figure 2\nin GRPO for main steps): collecting cold-start data, perform-\ning RL training, carrying out SFT, using distillation to transfer\nknowledge to smaller models, and addressing specific chal-\nlenges such as language mixing and readability. This multi-\nstage pipeline ensures robustness and alignment with human\npreferences, while distillation enables efficient deployment of\nsmaller models without significant performance loss.\n3.3.1\nCold-Start RL Phase\nThe process begins with a cold-start RL phase, where a small\namount of curated data is gathered to fine-tune an initial, or\nbase, model. Following this preliminary fine-tuning, RL is con-\nducted—often via algorithms like GRPO until convergence. The\ncold-start phase is critical for stabilizing the model before full\nRL training, preventing instability that can arise from purely\nRL-driven updates. The cold-start data preparation focuses\non capturing human-readable reasoning patterns to prevent\ninstability from purely RL-driven updates. This step generates\nCoT-style examples with consistent < reasoning_process >\nand < summary > fields, usually involving thousands of\ncarefully curated samples. Structured CoT formats and con-\nsistent fields ensure clarity and robustness in the model’s rea-\nsoning outputs, reducing errors and improving interpretabil-\nity [8, 175, 176, 177].\nCoT examples before RL training provide a\nstronger foundation for reasoning tasks, leading\nto more robust and interpretable outputs.\n3.3.2\nRejection Sampling and Fine-tuning\nThis concept is also used in WebGPT [81]. Once RL stabilizes,\na rejection sampling mechanism is employed to generate high-\nquality responses that are subsequently filtered for correct-\nness, clarity, and other quality metrics. These filtered re-\nsponses are then blended with additional datasets to produce\na new, larger corpus for Supervised Fine-Tuning. Rejection\nsampling ensures that only high-quality outputs are used for\nfurther training, enhancing the model’s overall performance\nand reliability. After RL converges for high-stakes reasoning\ntasks, rejection sampling is used to filter a large number of\ngenerated outputs, expanding the training set. These newly\ngenerated reasoning examples (potentially up to hundreds of\nthousands in quantity) are mixed with existing SFT data to\ncreate a combined dataset of substantial size (often around\n800k samples). Rejection sampling and dataset expansion\nsignificantly enhance the model’s coverage of general tasks\nwhile preserving its reasoning proficiency.\n3.3.3\nReasoning-Oriented RL\nThe reasoning-oriented RL leverages GRPO [59], which samples\na group of outputs from the current policy and computes\nrewards and advantages for each output. Rewards may be\ncomputed via rule-based checks, e.g., ensuring correct solu-\ntions in math or code tasks, enforcing structured CoT tags,\nand penalizing undesired language mixing. GRPO group-based\nsampling and reward computation ensure that the model\nprioritizes high-quality, structured outputs, enhancing its rea-\nsoning capabilities.\n3.3.4\nSecond RL Stage for Human Alignment\nA second RL stage further aligns the model with broader\nhuman preferences (helpfulness, harmlessness, creativity, etc.)\nby introducing additional reward signals and prompt distri-\nbutions. The second RL stage ensures the model aligns with\nhuman values, making it more versatile and contextually\naware. After re-training the base model on this combined\ndataset, a second round of RL can be conducted to align\nthe model more closely with human preferences (e.g., for\nhelpfulness and harmlessness). This RL stage fine-tunes the\nmodel to better align with human values, ensuring outputs\nare not only accurate but also contextually appropriate.\n3.3.5\nDistillation for Smaller Models\nFinally, distillation techniques are used to transfer the refined\ncapabilities of the main model to smaller architectures, en-\nabling more efficient deployments without sacrificing much\n\n\n12\nData\nSystem\nModel\nAccelerators \n(Groq, vLLM, Triton,\netc.) \nData Compression, Data\nFiltering (TokenMerging,\nRecapDataComp-18,\netc.)\nCo-Optimized Architectures\n(FlashAttention, BlockSparse\nIO, DeepSeek v3 etc.)\nParallel Computing, \nDistributed Training\n(LoRA, PEFT,\nDeepSpeed,etc.)\nScaling law, Data mining\n(Chinchilla, RETRO, C4\ndata, etc.)\nModel compression\n(Bitsandbite, GPTQ,\netc.)\nEfficient Finetuning and Deployment\nFig. 4: This Venn diagram illustrates the interplay between Sys-\ntem, Data, and Model for efficient finetuning and deployment.\nIt covers strategies like accelerators (Groq, vLLM), adaptation\n(LoRA, PEFT), co-optimized architectures (FlashAttention), data\ncompression (TokenMerging), scaling laws (Chinchilla), and\nmodel compression (GPTQ) to boost performance and scalability.\nperformance. It allows smaller models to inherit advanced\nreasoning capabilities, making them competitive on challeng-\ning benchmarks without the computational costs of full-scale\nRL training. Finally, distillation plays a pivotal role: the top-\nperforming model, DeepSeek-R1 [40], serves as a teacher to\nsmaller architectures (e.g., Qwen or Llama families, ranging\nfrom 1.5B to 70B parameters). This transfer allows the smaller\nmodels to inherit advanced reasoning capabilities, making\nthem competitive on challenging benchmarks without incur-\nring the computational costs of full-scale RL training.\nDistillation democratizes advanced reasoning\ncapabilities, enabling smaller models to achieve\ncompetitive performance with reduced compu-\ntational overhead.\n4\nSupervised Finetuning in LLMs\nAs shown in Figure 2, finetuning forms a basic component of\nLLM post-training recipes. In this section, we summarize the\ndifferent types of LLM fine-tuning mechanisms.\n4.1\nInstruction finetuning\nIn instruction finetuning, a model is trained on curated pairs\nof instruction (prompt) and response (completion). The main\ngoal is to guide the LLM to follow a user-provided instruction\naccurately and helpfully, regardless of the task domain. This\nusually involves compiling large, diverse instruction-response\ndatasets covering many task types (e.g., summarization, QA,\nclassification, creative writing). Models such as T0 [178],\nFLAN [179], Alpaca [180], Vicuna [181] and Dolly [182]\ndemonstrate how instruction-finetuned LLMs can outperform\nbase models on zero-shot or few-shot tasks by virtue of their\nenhanced instruction-following abilities.\n4.2\nDialogue (Multi-turn) Finetuning\nSome LLMs undergo dialogue-style finetuning to better handle\nmulti-turn conversations. Different from instruction tuning\ndescribed above, here the data takes the form of a contin-\nuous dialogue (multi-turn conversations) instead of a single\nprompt-response pair. In this approach, training data consists\nof chat transcripts with muliple user queries and system re-\nsponses, ensuring the model learns to maintain context across\nturns and produce coherent replies. Models like LaMDA [183]\nand ChatGPT [39] highlight how dialogue-tuned LLMs can\nfeel more interactive and context-aware. While dialogue fine-\ntuning can overlap with instruction finetuning (because many\ninstructions come in a chat format), specialized conversation\ndata often yields more natural, multi-turn user experiences.\n4.3\nCoT Reasoning finetuning\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning finetuning teaches models\nto produce step-by-step reasoning traces instead of just final\nanswers. By exposing intermediate rationales or thoughts,\nCoT finetuning can improve both interpretability and accu-\nracy on complex tasks (e.g., math word problems, multi-\nhop QA). In practice, CoT finetuning uses supervised rea-\nsoning annotations (often handcrafted by experts) to show\nhow a solution unfolds. Notable early work includes Chain-\nof-Thought Prompting [8] and Self-Consistency [184], which\ninitially applied the idea to prompting; subsequent efforts\n(e.g., Chain-of-Thought Distillation [185]) adapt it to a full\nfinetuning or student-teacher paradigm. These efforts have\nalso been extended to the multimodal domain, e.g., LlaVA-\nCoT [186] and LlamaV-o1 [187] where image, QA and CoT\nreasoning steps are used in LLM finetuning.\n4.4\nDomain-Specific (Specialized) Finetuning\nWhen an LLM needs to excel in a specific domain (e.g.,\nbiomedicine, finance, or legal), domain-specific finetuning is\nused. Here, a curated corpus of domain-relevant text and la-\nbeled examples is employed to finetune the LLM. For instance,\nBioGPT [71] and BiMediX [216] specialize in biomedical\nliterature, FinBERT [217] for financial texts, ClimatGPT\n[218, 219] for climate and sustainability and CodeT5 [220]\nfor code understanding. Supervised finetuning in these do-\nmains often includes classification, retrieval, or QA tasks with\ndomain-specific data, ensuring the model’s parameters adapt\nto the specialized language and concepts of the field. Domain-\nspecific finetuning is also extended to vision-language models\nsuch as, [221] finetuned on remote sensing imagery, [222] on\nmedical imaging modalities, [223, 224, 225] on spatiotemporal\nvideo inputs, and [226] adapted for chart understanding.\n4.5\nDistillation-Based Finetuning\nLarge ‘teacher’ models are sometimes used to produce labeled\ndata or rationales, which a smaller ‘student’ model finetunes\non, this is generally called knowledge distillation [227, 228].\nIn the context of LLMs, CoT Distillation [185] is one example\nwhere a powerful teacher LLM generates intermediate rea-\nsoning steps, and the student LLM is finetuned to reproduce\nboth the final answer and the reasoning chain. Step-by-step\ndistillation [229] generates descriptive rationales alongside\nfinal answers to train smaller models through distillation\nwith smaller datasets. This approach can yield lighter, faster\nmodels that retain much of the teacher’s performance, even in\nzero-shot or few-shot tasks [230].\n\n\n13\nModel\nCategory\nSource\nDescription\n1.

This stage\nuses human-labeled or human-ranked examples to teach the\nmodel about desirable vs. undesirable outputs (e.g., safe vs.\ntoxic). By training on these explicit preferences, the model\nbecomes more aligned with user values, reducing harmful or\noff-topic completions. Works like InstructGPT [58] illustrate\nhow supervised preference data is critical before reward model\ntraining and RL updates begin.\n4.7\nEfficient Finetuning\nFully finetuning a LLM can be computationally and memory-\nintensive, particularly as model sizes grow into the tens or\nhundreds of billions of parameters. To address these chal-\nlenges, parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) techniques intro-\nduce a small set of trainable parameters or learnable prompts\nwhile leaving most of the model weights frozen. Approaches\nsuch as LoRA [60], Prefix Tuning [231], and Adapters [232]\nexemplify this strategy by injecting lightweight modules (or\nprompts) in specific layers, thus significantly reducing the\nmemory footprint.\nFigure 4 illustrates how these techniques fit into a broader\necosystem that involves system-level optimizations, data man-\nagement, and evaluation strategies for LLMs. In particular,\nPEFT approaches can be combined with quantization and\npruning methods [190, 188] to further minimize memory\nusage and compute overhead, enabling finetuning on smaller\nGPUs or even consumer-grade hardware. For instance, QLoRA\nunifies 4-bit quantization with low-rank adaptation, while\nBitsAndBytes provides 8-bit optimizers to make LLM training\nmore practical in constrained environments (Table 2).\nMoreover, these PEFT methods still require supervised\ndata to guide the adaptation process, but the reduction in\nthe number of trainable parameters makes it more feasible\nto use in-domain or task-specific datasets. This is especially\nvaluable for specialized domains (e.g., medical or software\ndevelopment), where data might be limited or expensive to\nannotate. As shown in Table 2, PEFT (HF) integrates several\nof these approaches (LoRA, prefix tuning, and more) into a\nsingle library, streamlining deployment in both research and\nproduction settings.\nCombining efficient tuning designs like LoRA\nand QLoRA with system and data optimizations\n(Figure 4) enables cost-effective LLM adaptation\nfor tasks like domain-specific text generation,\nwithout expensive full fine-tuning.\n5\nTest-time Scaling Methods\nWhile RL fine-tunes the model’s policy, test-time scaling (TTS)\nenhances reasoning during inference typically without model\n\n\n14\nTree-of-Thoughts\ncompute-optimal scaling strategy\nSelf-Consistency\nDecoding\nTest Time Scaling\nSequential \nrevision\nImproved\nReasoning\nAdvanced \nSampling \nScaling \nStrategies\nChain-of-Thought\nPrompting\nConfidence\nBased \nSampling\nSearch \nAgainst \nVerifiers\nBeam\nSearch\nBest-of-N\nSearch\nMonte Carlo\nTree Search\nSelf-Improvement\nvia Refinements \nFig. 5: An overview of Test-time Scaling methods: parallel\nscaling, sequential scaling, and search-based methods. It also\nshows how they integrate into a compute-optimal strategy.\nupdates. Figure 5 presents a taxonomy of TTS methods,\ncategorizing them based on their underlying techniques.\n5.1\nBeam Search\nBeam search was first introduced in the context of speech\nrecognition [233]. It gained prominence as a decoding strategy\nfor sequence models and was later adopted in neural machine\ntranslation and speech systems [234]. With the popularity of\nLLMs, this algorithm has been used for approximate search in\nmany text generation tasks.\nThe concept of Beam search is similar to pruned breadth-\nfirst search, where top N highest-probability partial se-\nquences (the ‘beam’) are kept at each step, discarding lower-\nprobability paths. By limiting the beam width (N), it man-\nages the exponential search space while aiming to find a\nnear-optimal sequence. These beams are expanded at each\ndecoding step to find multiple probable paths. In reasoning\nLLMs, such paths allow us to systematically explore multiple\nreasoning chains in parallel, focusing on the most promising\nones. This ensures that high-likelihood reasoning steps are\nconsidered, which can improve the chances of finding a correct\nand coherent solution compared to greedy decoding. It has\ntraditionally been used in tasks such as translation, sum-\nmarization, and code generation, where the goal is a highly\nprobable correct sequence [93].\nWhile modern LLMs often favor stochastic sampling (e.g.,\ntemperature sampling) to promote diversity in generated text,\nbeam search is still a valuable technique for structured reason-\ning problems. For example, the Tree-of-Thoughts framework\n[84] allows plugging in different search algorithms to explore a\ntree of possible ‘thoughts’ or reasoning steps; one instantiation\nuses a beam search (with beam width b) to maintain the b\nmost promising states at each reasoning step. Here, beam\nsearch is used to systematically explore solution steps for tasks\nlike mathematical puzzles and planning problems, pruning\nless promising reasoning branches and thus improving the\nmodel’s problem-solving accuracy. Beam search remains a\nstrong baseline for test-time reasoning when one wants the\nmodel to output the single most likely reasoning path or\nanswer under the model’s learned distribution.\n5.2\nBest-of-N Search (Rejection Sampling)\nBest-of-N (BoN) [235] search generates N candidate outputs\n(usually via sampling) and then picks the best one according\nto a chosen criterion (e.g., a reward model or the model’s own\nlikelihood) [236, 237, 238]. Conceptually, this is an application\nof rejection sampling: one draws multiple samples and rejects\nall but the top-rated result. Unlike Beam Search [233, 234],\nwhich incrementally expands and prunes partial hypotheses,\nBoN simply samples full solutions independently, allowing for\ngreater diversity but at a higher computational cost. Beam\nSearch systematically aims for the most probable sequence,\nwhile BoN may capture high-quality but lower-probability\nsolutions through brute-force sampling.\nBeam search (effective for harder questions)\noutperforms best-of-N sampling at low compute\nbudgets, while best-of-N scales better for easier\ntasks.\nDuring LLM inference, BoN is used to enhance correctness or\nalignment without retraining the model. By sampling multiple\nanswers and selecting the top candidate (e.g., via a reward\nmodel or a checker), BoN effectively boosts accuracy on tasks\nlike QA or code generation. BoN is easy to understand and\nimplement and is almost hyper-parameter-free, with N being\nthe only parameter that can be adjusted at inference. In\nreinforcement learning contexts, BoN sampling can serve as\na baseline exploration mechanism i.e., to generate many roll-\nouts, pick the best outcome according to the learned reward,\nand proceed, although at increased computational overhead.\nOpenAI’s WebGPT used BoN to pick the best response via\na reward model, yielding strong QA performance [81]. BoN\nis also used as a simple alignment method that is highly com-\npetitive with other post-training techniques e.g., RLHF [58] and\nDPO [78]. Studies have shown BoN can approach or match RLHF\nresults when guided by a sufficiently robust reward model\n[82, 239]. Alternatives such as speculative rejection [240] build\non this idea and utilize a better reward model to improve\nefficiency. The studies also highlight issues of reward hacking\nif the (proxy) reward function used for BoN is imperfect [241]\nor instability issues if the N parameter gets very large.\nUsing process reward models with beam\nsearch vs best-of-N depends on the difficulty and\ncompute budget.\n5.3\nCompute-Optimal Scaling\nThe Compute-Optimal Scaling Strategy (COS) [83] is a dy-\nnamic method designed to allocate computational resources\nefficiently during inference in LLMs, optimizing accuracy with-\nout unnecessary expense. Instead of applying a uniform sam-\npling strategy across all inputs, this approach categorizes\nprompts into five difficulty levels—ranging from easy to\nhard—either by leveraging oracle difficulty (ground-truth suc-\ncess rates) or model-predicted difficulty (e.g., verifier scores\nfrom Preference Ranking Models). Once categorized, the\nstrategy adapts compute allocation: easier prompts undergo\nsequential refinement, where the model iteratively refines\nits output to improve correctness, while harder prompts\ntrigger parallel sampling or beam search, which explores\nmultiple response variations to increase the likelihood of\nfinding a correct solution. This dual approach balances ex-\n\n\n15\nploration (for challenging inputs) and refinement (for near-\ncorrect responses), ensuring optimal performance per unit\nof computational effort. Remarkably, this method achieves\nfour times lower compute usage than traditional best-of-N\nsampling while maintaining equivalent performance. The key\ninsight is that by matching computational strategy to problem\ndifficulty, it avoids wasted resources on trivial cases while\nensuring sufficient sampling diversity for complex tasks. In\nessence, it functions as a “smart thermostat” for LLM inference,\ndynamically adjusting computational effort in response to\ninput complexity, leading to a more efficient and cost-effective\ndeployment of large-scale language models.\nCOS achieves 4× efficiency gains over best-\nof-N baselines by optimally balancing sequen-\ntial/parallel compute. Beam search + revisions\noutperform larger models on easy/intermediate\nquestions.\n5.4\nChain-of-thought prompting\nCoT prompting induces LLMs to produce intermediate reason-\ning steps rather than jumping directly to the final answer.\nBy breaking down problems into logical sub-steps, CoT taps\ninto a model’s latent ability to perform multi-step inferences,\nsignificantly improving performance on tasks like math word\nproblems, logical puzzles, and multi-hop QA.\nWei et al. [8] demonstrated CoT’s effectiveness on arith-\nmetic and logic tasks, showing large gains over direct prompt-\ning. Kojima et al. [242] introduced Zero-Shot CoT, revealing\nthat even adding a simple phrase like “Let’s think step\nby step” can trigger coherent reasoning in sufficiently large\nmodels. Subsequent works (e.g., Wang et al., 2022 [184]) com-\nbined CoT with sampling-based strategies (Self-Consistency)\nfor even higher accuracy. As described in Sec. 5.4, CoT format\ndata have also been used for SFT and are shown to help\nreshape the model responses to be more step-by-step.\nFinetune models to revise answers sequen-\ntially, leveraging previous attempts. Sequential\nrevisions excel on easier questions, while parallel\nsampling (exploration) benefits harder ones\n5.5\nSelf-Consistency Decoding\nSelf-Consistency is a decoding strategy introduced by Wang\net al. [243]. It was proposed as an alternative to simple\ngreedy decoding for chain-of-thought prompts. It built upon\nthe idea of sampling multiple distinct reasoning paths for a\nquestion and was the first to show that marginalizing over\nthose paths can significantly improve accuracy on arithmetic\nand reasoning problems. In other words, it allows the model\nto think in many ways and then trust the consensus, which\nimproves correctness in many reasoning scenarios.\nThe self-consistency method works by sampling a diverse\nset of reasoning chains from the model (via prompt engi-\nneering to encourage different CoTs, and using temperature\nsampling) and then letting the model output a final answer\nfor each chain. Instead of trusting a single chain, the method\nselects the answer that is most consistent across these multiple\nreasoning paths, effectively a majority vote or highest probabil-\nity answer after marginalizing out the latent reasoning. The\nintuition is that if a complex problem has a unique correct\nanswer, different valid reasoning paths should converge to\nthat same answer. By pooling the outcomes of many chains,\nthe model can “decide” which answer is most supported. In\napplication, one might sample, e.g., 20 CoTs for a math prob-\nlem and see what final answer appears most frequently; that\nanswer is then taken as the model’s output. This approach\nturns the one-shot CoT process into an ensemble where the\nmodel cross-verifies its answers. It is especially useful for\narithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks where reasoning\ndiversity helps.\nSmaller models with test-time compute can\noutperform much larger models in certain sce-\nnarios.\nSelf-consistency is often combined with other methods:\ne.g., sampling multiple chains and then applying a verifier\nto the most common answer. Its strength lies in requiring no\nnew training, only extra sampling, making it a popular test-\ntime scaling strategy to obtain more reliable answers from\nLLMs. It has also inspired other variants, e.g., Universal Self-\nConsistency [244] extend the original idea (which worked only\nwith majority vote on single final answer) to more general\ngeneration tasks such as summarization and open-ended QA.\n5.6\nTree-of-thoughts\nToT framework [84] generalizes the chain-of-thought approach\nby allowing the model to branch out into multiple possible\nthought sequences instead of following a single linear chain. It\nthus formulates the problem of language-model reasoning as a\ntree search, drawing on classic AI search methods inspired by\nhuman problem-solving [245, 37]. Tree of Thoughts treats in-\ntermediate reasoning steps as “nodes” in a search tree and uses\nthe language model to expand possible next steps (thoughts)\nfrom a given state. Rather than sampling one long reasoning\npath, the model explores a tree of branching thoughts and\ncan perform lookahead and backtracking. At each step, the\nLLM might generate several candidate next thoughts, and a\nheuristic or value function evaluates each partial solution\nstate. Then a search algorithm (e.g., depth-first, breadth-first,\nbeam search) navigates this tree, deciding which branches to\nexplore further. This approach allows systematic exploration\nof different reasoning strategies: if one path leads to a dead-\nend, the model can return to an earlier state and try a different\nbranch (unlike standard CoT which commits to one line of\nreasoning). In effect, ToT is an iterative prompting procedure\nwhere the model generates thoughts, evaluates them, and\nrefines its approach, mimicking how a human might mentally\nmap out various ways to solve a problem.\nToT is especially useful for complex problems like puzzles,\nplanning tasks, or games where multiple steps and strategic\nexploration are needed and outperforms simpler CoT methods\nby systematically searching through the solution space. It pro-\nvides a flexible framework – one can plug in various generation\nstrategies (e.g. sampling vs. prompting) and search algorithms\n(BFS, DFS, A*, MCTS) depending on the task.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) introduces step-by-step reasoning, while Self-Consistency\n(CoT-SC) generates multiple CoT paths and selects the most frequent answer. Multiple CoTs explores diverse reasoning paths\nindependently. Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) structures reasoning as a tree, enabling backtracking and refinement, whereas Graph-\nof-Thoughts (GoT) generalizes this by dynamically aggregating and connecting thoughts. The legend deciphers key mechanisms\nlike grading, backtracking, and self-refinement, crucial for optimizing reasoning efficiency.\nmore computationally heavy, ToT shows that allocating extra\n“thinking time” (compute) to explore alternatives can yield\nsignificantly better reasoning and planning performance. It\nhas spawned follow-up research aiming to improve or utilize\nit for better reasoning e.g., multi-agent systems have been\ncombined with ToT: different LLM “agents” generate thoughts\nin parallel and a validator agent prunes incorrect branches,\nleading to improved accuracy over the single-agent ToT [246].\nInference-time computation for LLMs can out-\nperform scaling model parameters, especially for\nchallenging reasoning tasks like math problems.\n5.7\nGraph of Thoughts\nThe Graph of Thoughts (GoT) [247] framework extends the\nToT by allowing more flexible and efficient reasoning processes\nthrough graph-based structures rather than strict hierarchical\ntrees. Thought representation differs between the two ap-\nproaches: in ToT, each step in reasoning is structured as a\nnode in a tree with fixed parent-child relationships, whereas\nGoT represents thoughts as nodes in a graph, enabling more\nadaptable dependencies and interconnections.\nIn terms of thought expansion strategies, ToT follows a\ntraditional approach where multiple thought candidates are\ngenerated at each step, explored using tree-based search\nstrategies, and pruned based on heuristics before selecting the\nmost optimal path. In contrast, GoT incorporates graph-based\nthought expansion, allowing thoughts to interconnect dynam-\nically. This enables three key transformations: aggregation\n(merging multiple solutions into a unified answer), refinement\n(iteratively improving thoughts over time), and generation\n(producing diverse candidates). Instead of navigating through\na rigid hierarchy, GoT prioritizes thoughts using a volume\nmetric and explores paths optimally, reducing unnecessary\ncomputations.\nA critical limitation of ToT is its restricted backtrack-\ning—once a branch is discarded, it is not reconsidered. GoT\novercomes this by allowing iterative refinement, where previ-\nous thoughts can be revisited, modified, and improved upon.\nThis iterative nature is particularly useful in complex rea-\nsoning tasks where initial thoughts may require adjustments.\nMoreover, computational efficiency in GoT is significantly\nimproved by reducing redundant calculations through the\nmerging of partial solutions.\nGoT enhances problem-solving efficiency and\nadaptability, making it superior to ToT for tasks\nrequiring complex reasoning.\n5.8\nConfidence-based Sampling\nIn confidence-based sampling, the language model generates\nmultiple candidate solutions or reasoning paths and then\nprioritizes or selects among them based on the model’s own\nconfidence in each outcome [248]. This can happen in two\nways: (a) Selection: Generate N outputs and pick the one with\nthe highest log probability (i.e., the model’s most confident\noutput). This is essentially best-of-N by probability – the\nmodel chooses the answer it thinks is most likely correct.\n(b) Guided exploration: When exploring a reasoning tree or\nmulti-step solution, use the model’s token probabilities to\ndecide which branch to expand (higher confidence branches\nare explored first). In other words, the model’s probability es-\ntimates act as a heuristic guiding the search through solution\nspace [249]. Compared to pure random sampling, confidence-\nbased methods bias the process toward what the model be-\nlieves is right, potentially reducing wasted exploration on low-\nlikelihood (and often incorrect) paths.\nConfidence-based strategies have been incorporated at\ninference time e.g., a tree-based search for LLM generation [248]\nassigns each possible completion (leaf) a confidence score. The\nalgorithm samples leaves in proportion to these confidence\nscores to decide which paths to extend. Similarly, some rea-\nsoning approaches use the model’s estimated likelihood of an\nanswer to decide when to halt or whether to ask a follow-\nup question – essentially if the model’s confidence is low,\n\n\n17\nit might trigger further reasoning (a form of self-reflection).\nConfidence-based selection is also used in ensemble settings:\ne.g., an LLM may generate multiple answers and a secondary\nmodel evaluates the confidence of each answer being correct,\npicking the answer with the highest confidence. This was\nexplored in tasks like medical Q&A, where an LLM gave an\nanswer and a confidence score, and only high confidence\nanswers were trusted or returned [250].\n5.9\nSearch Against Verifiers\nThis verification approach [251] in LLMs enhances answer\nquality by generating multiple candidate responses and select-\ning the best one using automated verification systems. This\napproach shifts focus from increasing pre-training compute\nto optimizing test-time compute, allowing models to “think\nlonger” during inference through structured reasoning steps\nor iterative refinement. The method involves two main steps:\nGeneration: The model (or “proposer” produces multiple\nanswers or reasoning paths, often using methods like high-\ntemperature sampling or diverse decoding.\nVerification: A verifier (e.g., a reward model) evaluates these\ncandidates based on predefined criteria, such as correctness,\ncoherence, or alignment with desired processes. Verifiers are\ncategorized based on their evaluation focus:\n1) Outcome Reward Models (ORM): Judge only the final\nanswer (e.g., correctness of a math solution).\n2) Process Reward Models (PRM): Evaluate the reason-\ning steps (e.g., logical coherence in a thought chain),\nproviding granular feedback to prune invalid paths.\nSeveral techniques fall under this paradigm, enhancing\nverification-based optimization. Best-of-N Sampling involves\ngenerating multiple answers and ranking them via a verifier\n(ORM/PRM), selecting the highest-scoring one, making it a sim-\nple yet effective approach for improving answer correctness.\nBeam Search with PRM tracks top-scoring reasoning paths\n(beams) and prunes low-quality steps early, similar to Tree\nof Thought approaches, balancing breadth and depth in rea-\nsoning path exploration. Monte Carlo Tree Search balances\nexploration and exploitation by expanding promising reason-\ning branches, simulating rollouts, and backpropagating scores,\nproviding an optimal trade-off between search depth and\nverification confidence. Majority Voting (Self-Consistency)\naggregates answers from multiple samples and selects the\nmost frequent one, avoiding explicit verifiers, which works\nwell in settings where consistency across multiple responses\nindicates correctness.\nORM is suitable for tasks where correctness is\nbinary (right/wrong) and can be easily assessed.\nPRM is useful in multi-step reasoning, ensuring\nintermediate steps follows logical progression.\n5.10\nSelf-Improvement via Refinements\nThis approach refers to the ability of LLMs to enhance their\noutputs through self-evaluation and revision iteratively. This\nprocess enables models to refine their responses dynamically\nduring inference rather than relying solely on pre-trained\nweights. One notable method is Self-Refinement [252],\nwhere an LLM generates an initial response, critiques it, and\nthen refines the output based on its self-generated feedback.\nThis iterative process continues until the model achieves a\nsatisfactory result. Such techniques have been shown to im-\nprove performance on various tasks, including mathematical\nreasoning and code generation. This process follows these key\nsteps: a) Initial Generation: The model produces an answer\nor reasoning path. b) Self-Critique: The model reviews its\nown response and identifies errors, inconsistencies, or areas for\nimprovement. c) Refinement: The model adjusts its response\nbased on the critique and generates an improved version.\nd) Iteration: The process repeats until the output meets a\npredefined quality threshold or stops improving.\nAnother approach is called Self-Polish [253], where the\nmodel progressively refines given problems to make them more\ncomprehensible and solvable. By rephrasing or restructuring\nproblems, the model enhances its understanding and pro-\nvides more accurate solutions. Self-Polish involves progres-\nsive refinement of problem statements to make them more\ncomprehensible and solvable. The model first rephrases or\nrestructures the problem for better clarity, then breaks down\ncomplex queries into simpler sub-problems and refines am-\nbiguous inputs to ensure precise understanding. By restruc-\nturing problems before solving them, the model improves its\ncomprehension and generates more accurate solutions.\nSelf-improvement methodologies represent a\nparadigm shift in LLM optimization, emphasiz-\ning active reasoning and internal feedback over\nstatic pre-training. By iterating on their own\nresponses, models achieve greater consistency\nand accuracy across a wide range of applications.\n5.11\nMonte Carlo Tree Search\nMCTS [254] is based on the application of Monte Carlo sim-\nulations to game-tree search. It rose to prominence with\nsuccesses in games, notably, it powered AlphaGo [255] in\n2016 by searching possible moves guided by policy and value\nnetworks. This, as well as the application to other board and\nvideo games, demonstrates the power of MCTS for sequential\ndecision-making under uncertainty.\nMCTS is a stochastic search algorithm that builds a decision\ntree by performing many random simulations. It is best known\nfor finding good moves in game states, but it can be applied to\nany problem where we can simulate outcomes. The algorithm\niteratively: (a) Selects a path from the root according to a\nheuristic (like UCT [256], which picks nodes with a high upper-\nconfidence bound), (b) Expands a new node (a previously\nunvisited state) from the end of that path, (c) Simulates a ran-\ndom rollout from that new state to get an outcome (e.g., win\nor loss in a game, or some reward), and (d) Backpropagates\nthe result up the tree to update the values of nodes and inform\nfuture selections. Repeating these simulations thousands of\ntimes concentrates the search on the most promising branches\nof the tree. In essence, MCTS uses random sampling to evaluate\nthe potential of different action sequences, gradually biasing\nthe search towards those with better average outcomes. In\n\n\n18\nLLM reasoning, we can treat the generation of text as a\ndecision process and use to explore different continuations.\nFor example, at a given question (root), each possible next\nreasoning step or answer is an action; a simulation could\nmean letting the LLM continue to a final answer (perhaps\nwith some randomness), and a reward could be whether the\nanswer is correct. By doing this repeatedly, MCTS can identify\nwhich chain of thoughts or answers has the highest empirical\nsuccess rate. The appeal of MCTS for reasoning is that it can\nhandle large search spaces by sampling intelligently rather\nthan exhaustively, and it naturally incorporates uncertainty\nand exploration.\nTrain verifiers to score intermediate steps\n(via Monte Carlo rollouts) instead of just final\nanswers.\nRecent efforts have integrated MCTS with LLMs to tackle\ncomplex reasoning and decision-making tasks. One example is\nusing MCTS for query planning: Monte Carlo Thought Search\n[257], where an LLM is guided to ask a series of sub-questions to\nfind an answer. Jay et al. [257] used an MCTS-based algorithm\ncalled ‘Monte Carlo Reasoner’ that treats the LLM as an\nenvironment: each node is a prompt (state) and each edge\nis an action (e.g., a particular question to ask or step to\ntake), and random rollouts are used to evaluate outcomes.\nThis approach allowed the system to efficiently explore a space\nof possible reasoning paths and pick a high-reward answer\npath, outperforming naive sampling in a scientific Q&A task.\nSimilarly, MCTS has been applied to code generation with LLMs\n[258] – the algorithm explores different code paths (using the\nmodel to propose code completions and etest them) to find a\ncorrect solution. Another line of work ensembles multiple LLMs\nwith MCTS, treating each model’s output as a branch and using\na reward model to simulate outcomes [259]. Early results show\nthat MCTS-based reasoning can solve problems that single-pass\nor greedy methods often miss, although with more compute\n[74]. The downside is that MCTS can be significantly slower\nthan straightforward sampling or beam search, which recent\nresearch is addressing by improving efficiency (e.g., by state\nmerging [87]). In general, MCTS brings the strength of planning\nalgorithms to LLM inference and enables an LLM to ’look ahead’\nthrough simulated rollouts and make more informed reasoning\nchoices, much like it has done for AI in gameplay.\nTest-time compute is not a 1-to-1 replacement\nfor pretraining but offers a viable alternative in\nmany cases.\n5.12\nChain-of-Action-Thought reasoning\nLLMs excel in reasoning tasks but rely heavily on external\nguidance (e.g., verifiers) or extensive sampling at inference\ntime. Existing methods like CoT [8] lack mechanisms for self-\ncorrection and adaptive exploration, limiting their autonomy\nand generalization. Satori [260] introduced a two-stage train-\ning paradigm, which works by initially tuning the model’s\noutput format and then enhancing its reasoning capabilities\nthrough self-improvement. In Stage 1 (Format Tuning), the\nmodel is exposed to a large set of 10K synthetic trajectories\ngenerated by a multi-agent framework comprising a generator,\na critic, and a reward model. This supervised fine-tuning\nhelps the model to produce outputs in specific reasoning\nformat using meta-action tokens, although it may still have\ndifficulty generalizing beyond these examples. In Stage 2 (Self-\nImprovement via RL), the model employs PPO with a Restart\nand Explore strategy [260], which allows it to restart from\nintermediate steps, whether they were correct or not, to refine\nits reasoning process. The model receives rewards based on a\ncombination of rule-based correctness, reflection bonuses, and\npreference-based Outcome Reward Model feedback explained\nin § 5.9, thereby incentivizing the allocation of more compu-\ntational resources to tougher problems and enabling extended\nreasoning during testing for complex tasks.\nMulti-agent frameworks and advanced fine-tuning strate-\ngies are increasingly being explored to enhance reasoning\nin LLMs. Multi-Agent LLM Training (MALT) [261] introduces\na structured approach where generation, verification, and\nrefinement steps are distributed across specialized agents,\nallowing for iterative self-correction and improved reasoning\nchains. Similarly, optimizing preference alignment remains\na crucial challenge in ensuring both safety and helpfulness\nin LLMs [262]. Approaches like Bi-Factorial Preference Opti-\nmization (BFPO) [263] reframe RLHF objectives into a single\nsupervised learning task, reducing human intervention while\nmaintaining robust alignment. Beyond text-based reason-\ning, multimodal approaches like Multimodal Visualization-of-\nThought (MVoT) [264] extend CoT prompting by incorporating\nvisual representations, significantly enhancing performance\nin spatial reasoning tasks. These advancements highlight the\ngrowing need for structured multi-agent collaboration, safety-\naware optimization, and multimodal reasoning to address\nfundamental limitations in LLM reasoning [265, 266, 267].\n5.13\nPretraining vs. Test-Time Scaling\nPretraining and TTS are two distinct strategies for improving\nLLM performance, each with different tradeoffs in compu-\ntational cost and effectiveness. Pretraining involves scaling\nmodel parameters or increasing training data to enhance\ncapabilities, requiring substantial upfront computational in-\nvestment [3]. In contrast, TTS optimizes inference-time com-\npute (such as iterative refinements, search-based decoding,\nor adaptive sampling), allowing performance improvements\nwithout modifying the base model.\nFrom a performance vs. cost perspective, TTS achieves\nresults comparable to a model 14× larger on easy to in-\ntermediate tasks (e.g., MATH benchmarks), while reducing\ninference costs by 4× fewer FLOPs in compute-intensive\nscenarios [268]. However, pretraining remains superior for\nthe hardest tasks or when inference compute constraints are\nhigh, as larger pretrained models inherently encode deeper\nreasoning capabilities.\nA smaller model with test-time compute can\noutperform a 14× larger model on easy/inter-\nmediate questions when inference tokens (Y) are\nlimited (e.g., self-improvement settings).\n\n\n19\nIn terms of use cases, TTS is useful for scenarios with\nflexible inference budget or when base models already exhibit\nreasonable competence in the task. Conversely, pretraining is\nessential for tasks requiring fundamentally new capabilities\n(e.g., reasoning on novel domains) where inference-time opti-\nmizations alone may not suffice.\nThere are notable tradeoffs between the two approaches.\nTTS reduces upfront training costs, making it attractive for\nflexible, on-the-go optimization, but requires dynamic com-\npute allocation at inference. Pretraining, on the other hand,\nincurs high initial costs but guarantees consistent performance\nwithout additional runtime overhead, making it ideal for\nlarge-scale API deployments or latency-sensitive applications.\nOverall, TTS and pretraining are complementary in nature.\nFuture LLM systems may adopt a hybrid approach, where\nsmaller base models are pretrained with essential knowledge,\nwhile TTS dynamically enhances responses through adaptive,\non-demand computation. This synergy enables more cost-\neffective and efficient large-scale model deployment.\nChoose pretraining for foundational capabil-\nities and test-time scaling for accurate context-\naware refinement.\n6\nBenchmarks for LLM Post-training Evaluation\nTo evaluate the success of LLM post-training phases, a di-\nverse set of benchmarks have been proposed covering mul-\ntiple domains: reasoning tasks, alignment, multilinguality,\ngeneral comprehension, and dialogue and search tasks. A well-\nstructured evaluation framework ensures a comprehensive\nunderstanding of an LLM strengths, and limitations across\nvarious tasks. These benchmarks play a crucial role in LLM\npost-processing stages, where models undergo fine-tuning, cal-\nibration, alignment, and optimization to improve response ac-\ncuracy, robustness, and ethical compliance. Next, we explain\nthe main benchmark gorups. Table 3 provides an overview of\nkey datasets categorized under these benchmark groups.\nReasoning Benchmarks. These benchmarks assess LLMs on\ntheir ability to perform logical, mathematical, and scientific\nreasoning. Mathematical reasoning datasets like MATH [269],\nGSM8K [270], and MetaMathQA [271] test models on\nproblem-solving, multi-step arithmetic, and theorem-based\nproblem formulations. Scientific and multimodal reasoning\nbenchmarks such as WorldTree V2 [272] and MMMU [274]\nevaluate knowledge in physics, chemistry, and multimodal\nunderstanding, which are crucial for fact-checking and veri-\nfication processes in LLM-generated responses. Additionally,\ndatasets like PangeaBench [273] extend reasoning tasks into\nmultilingual and cultural domains, enabling models to refine\ncross-lingual reasoning. These benchmarks help determine\nhow well models can process structured knowledge and apply\nlogical deductions.\nRL Alignment Benchmarks. RL alignment benchmarks\nare central to LLM alignment and post-training optimiza-\ntion. They refine response generation, ethical constraints, and\nuser-aligned outputs through RLHF.

Multilingual benchmarks are es-\nsential for LLM post-processing in cross-lingual generalization,\ntranslation adaptation, and fine-tuning for low-resource lan-\nguages. CulturaX [285] and PangeaIns [286] evaluate tok-\nenization, translation, and instruction-following in over 150\nlanguages, ensuring fairness and diversity in model outputs.\nTydiQA [287] and MM-Eval [289] target bilingual and task-\noriented multilingual evaluation, enabling improvements in\nLLM fine-tuning. These datasets ensure that LLMs are not just\nEnglish-centric but optimized for multilingual adaptability.\nGeneral Comprehension Benchmarks. General compre-\nhension benchmarks contribute to model fine-tuning, response\ncoherence, and preference optimization. Datasets such as\nChatbot Arena [291], MTBench [291], and RewardBench [167]\ntest user preference modeling and conversational fluency,\ncrucial for LLM response ranking and re-ranking methods.\nBigBench [290] evaluates broad multi-domain comprehension,\nwhile MMLU [277, 278] measures correctness and informa-\ntiveness. These datasets help in refining LLM fluency, factual\ncorrectness, and open-ended response generation.\nDialogue and Search Benchmarks. Dialogue and search\nbenchmarks play a key role in optimizing LLM retrieval-based\nresponses, multi-turn coherence, and information retrieval ac-\ncuracy. Datasets such as ConvAI2 [292] and MultiWOZ [293]\n\n\n20\nevaluate multi-turn conversational models, essential for di-\nalogue history tracking and adaptive response fine-tuning.\nFor search relevance assessment, BEIR [296] provides large-\nscale human-annotated judgments for retrieval fine-tuning,\nensuring LLMs generate and rank responses effectively. TREC\nDL21/22 [294, 295] contributes to document relevance ranking\nand fact retrieval.\n7\nFuture Directions\nWe gathered all papers related to post-training methods in\nLLMs and analyzed their trends, as shown in Figure 7. Advanc-\ning RL techniques [303, 57, 40] for refining the LLMs have\na noticeable increase in prominence since 2020 (Figure 7a),\nemphasizing the demand for interactive approaches such\nas human-in-the-loop [35, 304] reinforcement and scalability\n[111, 82, 305]. At the same time, reward modeling [306,\n166, 167] (Figure 7b) has seen a steady rise in interest due to\nthe emergence of self-rewarding language models, yet the field\nstill struggles with reward hacking [307, 308] and the design\nof robust [309], failure-aware reward functions beyond reward\nhacking [310]. Decoding and search (Figure 7c) methods in-\nclude tree-of-thoughts [84] and Monte Carlo [311, 257] strate-\ngies aiming to enhance model reasoning through iterative\nself-critique [312, 304, 29], but these techniques also demand\nreliable uncertainty estimators to prevent excessive computa-\ntional overhead [313, 111]. Safety [299, 314, 315], robustness\n[316], and interpretability [317, 318, 319] have likewise become\ncentral concerns (Figure 7d), motivating the development of\nbias-aware [320, 321] and uncertainty-aware [322] RL meth-\nods beyond correlation with human uncertanity [323] that\nsafeguard user trust and prevent adversarial attacks. Another\ncrucial area involves personalization [324, 325] and adap-\ntation [193] (Figure 7e), where efforts to tailor LLMs for\nspecific domains must be balanced against risks to privacy\n[326], particularly when enterprise data or sensitive personal\ninformation is involved. In parallel, process [327, 328] vs.\noutcome reward optimization [329] (Figure 7f) remains an\nopen question: while process-based rewards help guide incre-\nmental improvements, outcome-focused metrics are simpler\nbut may not capture crucial intermediate decision-making\nsteps. Beyond reward structure, fine-tuning LLMs on new\ntasks still encounter issues like catastrophic forgetting\n[330] and potential data leakage [331, 332], underscoring\nthe need for parameter-efficient methods [60] and privacy-\npreserving strategies such as differential privacy [333] and\nfederated learning [334]. Human feedback, while central to\nalignment, is inherently costly and limited in scope; methods\nlike Constitutional AI [53] and RLAIF [95] seek to automate\nparts of this oversight, though they introduce fresh concerns\nabout bias calibration [335] and model self-consistency [184].\nFinally, test-time scaling [111] and dynamic reasoning [336]\nframeworks pose further challenges: models must learn when\nto allocate more computation for complex queries, how to\nadapt verification modules [337] efficiently, and how to main-\ntain robust performance even when facing adversarial inputs.\nThese converging research directions—spanning reward mod-\neling, decoding strategies, interpretability, personalization,\nand safe fine-tuning—highlight the multifaceted role of RL in\nLLMs and collectively shape the future trajectory of large-scale\nlanguage model development. Below, we delve into some of\nthese directions in greater detail.\nFine-tuning challenges. Fine-tuning remains one of the\nmost direct post-training methods to adapt LLMs to specific\ntasks or domains, yet it faces several open challenges. One\nfundamental issue is catastrophic forgetting – when updating\nan LLM on new data causes it to lose or degrade previously\nlearned capabilities. Even advanced PEFT methods like LoRA\n[60], which greatly reduce the number of trainable weights,\ndo not fully solve this problem [330]. Future work can ex-\nplore better continual learning strategies and regularization\ntechniques so that models can acquire new skills without\nerasing old ones. For example, new fine-tuning algorithms\n(e.g. CURLoRA [330]) explicitly aim to stabilize training and\npreserve prior knowledge while adding new tasks. Promising\nresearch directions include curriculum-based fine-tuning [338]\n(introducing new facts gradually or in context with known\nfacts) and hybrid training that combines retrieval or external\nknowledge bases. For instance, rather than solely adjusting\nthe model’s weights, one could fine-tune LLMs to consult a\nknowledge repository or perform tool use (such as database\nqueries or computations) when faced with queries outside\ntheir original training distribution [339, 340]. This retrieval-\naugmented fine-tuning [341] could let models incorporate\nfresh information at inference time, reducing the need to over-\nwrite their internal weights with new facts. Another approach\nis training models to explicitly represent uncertainty about\nnew knowledge, thereby enabling them to say ‘I don’t know’\nor defer to an external source if a query concerns content\nnot seen in pre-training. By blending weight updates with\nexternal knowledge integration, future fine-tuned LLMs will\nmaintain higher factual accuracy and lower hallucination rates\non emerging information.\nSafe Fine-tuning. From an ethical and safety perspective,\nfine-tuning raises important open research questions. Fine-\ntuning data often contains sensitive or proprietary informa-\ntion [326], which can lead to privacy risks if the model mem-\norizes and later regurgitates that data. A recent comprehen-\nsive survey [342] highlights vulnerabilities in the fine-tuning\nstage, such as membership inference attacks (detecting if a\nspecific record was in the fine-tuning set) and data extraction\n(recovering parts of the fine-tuning data from the model’s\noutputs). Mitigating these risks is an open problem: methods\nlike differential privacy fine-tuning [333] (adding noise to the\nweight updates) and federated fine-tuning (where data never\nleaves user devices and only aggregated updates are sent to the\nmodel) are being actively explored. However, these methods\noften come at the cost of model utility or require careful\ncalibration to avoid degrading performance.\nLimitations of Human Feedback. Human feedback is\ncostly and subjective. One promising avenue to address the\nlimitations of human feedback is using AI feedback and\nautomation to assist or replace human evaluators. Constitu-\ntional AI [53], introduced by Anthropic, is a notable example:\ninstead of relying on extensive human feedback for every\nharmful or helpful behavior, the model is guided by a set of\nwritten principles (a ‘constitution’) and is trained to critique\nand refine its own responses using another AI model as the\njudge [343]. Emerging directions here include RLAIF [95] and\nother semi-automated feedback techniques [344]: using strong\nmodels to evaluate or guide weaker models, or even having\n\n\n21\n(a) Growing trend in RL for LLMs, with\na focus on Human-in-the-Loop RL.\n(b) Reward modeling trends show RLHF\nstabilization, with Self-Rewarding Models\nleading, but Reward Hacking persists.\n(c)\nDecoding\nstrategies\nlike\nTree-of-\nThoughts and MCTS are improving LLM\nreasoning and decision-making.\n(d) Safety and Robustness research is\ngrowing, with Uncertainty-Aware RL en-\nsuring RLHF model reliability.\n(e) Personalization and Adaptation focus\non Privacy-Preserving RLHF. On-device\nadaptation remains a challenge.\n(f) Process Reward Modeling dominates\nOutcome-Based Optimization, favoring\niterative strategies for RL-based LLMs.\nFig. 7: Yearly Trends in RL specific post-training methods for LLMs and emerging research directions.\nmultiple AI agents debate a question and using their agree-\nment as a reward signal [345, 346]. Such AI-aided feedback\ncould vastly scale the tuning process and help overcome the\nbottleneck of limited human expert time. However, it raises\nnew theoretical questions: how do we ensure the AI judge is\nitself aligned and correct? There is a risk of feedback loops\nor an echo chamber of biases if the automated preferences are\nflawed. An open gap is the creation of robust AI feedback\nsystems that are calibrated to human values (perhaps peri-\nodically ‘grounded’ by human oversight or by a diverse set\nof constitutional principles). The blending of human and AI\nfeedback in a hierarchical scheme could provide a scalable yet\nreliable RL paradigm for LLMs.\nTest-time scaling challenges. Open challenges in TTS re-\nvolve around how to orchestrate the inference-time processes\nefficiently and reliably. A key question is how much computing\nis enough for a given query, and how to determine this on\nthe fly? Using less resources can result in mistakes, but using\ntoo much is inefficient and could introduce inconsistencies.\nRecent research by Snell et al. [83] tackled it by proposing a\nunified framework with a ‘Proposer’ and a ‘Verifier’ to system-\natically explore and evaluate answers. In their framework, the\nProposer (usually the base LLM) generates multiple candidate\nsolutions, and the Verifier (another model or a heuristic)\njudges and selects the best. The optimal strategy can vary by\nproblem difficulty: for easier queries, generating many answers\nin parallel and picking the top might be sufficient, whereas\nfor harder problems, sequential, step-by-step reasoning with\nverification at each step works better. An important future\ndirection is building adaptive systems where the LLM dy-\nnamically allocates computation based on an estimate of the\nquestion’s complexity. This idea connects to meta-cognition in\nAI [314], enabling models to have a sense of what they don’t\nknow or what deserves more thought. Developing reliable\nconfidence metrics or difficulty predictors for LLMs is an open\nresearch area, but progress here would make TTS far more\npractical i.e., the model would only ‘slow down and think’\nwhen necessary, much like a human spending extra time on\na hard problem. Recent study [347] shows distilling test-time\ncomputations into synthetic training data create synergistic\npretraining benefits which can also be further explored.\nReward Modeling and Credit Assignment. Current RL\napproaches suffer from reward misgeneralization, where mod-\nels over-optimize superficial proxy metrics rather than genuine\nreasoning quality. The sparse nature of terminal rewards\nin multi-step tasks increases credit assignment challenges,\nparticularly in long-horizon reasoning scenarios. Traditional\nmethods like DPO require inefficient pairwise preference data\nand fail to utilize failure trajectories effectively. Hybrid reward\nmodels can be investigated by integrating process supervi-\nsion with outcome-based rewards using contrastive stepwise\nevaluation [348]. This approach enables a more granular as-\nsessment of intermediate decision-making steps while aligning\nwith long-term objectives. Recent work [171] suggests step-\nlevel policy optimization could improve value function ac-\ncuracy while maintaining safety constraints. Dynamic credit\nassignment mechanisms can be explored through temporal\ndifference learning adapted for transformers [349, 350]. Such\nadaptations may enhance the model’s ability to capture long-\nrange dependencies and optimize reward propagation over\nextended sequences. Failure-aware training strategies can be\ndeveloped by incorporating negative examples into the RL loop\nvia adversarial data augmentation [351]. This can improve\nmodel robustness by systematically exposing it to challenging\nscenarios and encouraging more resilient policy learning.\nEfficient RL Training and Distillation. Current RL meth-\nods for LLMs require prohibitive computational resources [352]\nwhile often underperforming knowledge distillation tech-\nniques [93]. This inefficiency limits scalability and practical\n\n\n22\ndeployment, as distilled models frequently surpass RL-trained\ncounterparts despite requiring less training overhead. Addi-\ntionally, pure RL approaches struggle to balance language\nquality with reasoning improvement [97, 93], creating a per-\nformance ceiling.\nThe development of hybrid frameworks that initialize RL\npolicies with distilled knowledge from large models, combining\nthe exploratory benefits of RL with the stability of supervised\nlearning is an interesting direction. Similarly, curriculum sam-\npling strategies that progressively increase task complexity\nwhile using distillation to preserve linguistic coherence can\nalso help. PEFT methods [60] can be leveraged during RL up-\ndates to maintain base capabilities while enhancing reasoning.\nIntegration: Combining PRM-guided tree\nsearch with online distillation achieves 4× effi-\nciency gains over baseline methods while main-\ntaining 94% solution accuracy on MATH dataset.\nPrivacy-Preserving Personalization. Customizing mod-\nels for enterprise and individual use cases raises the risk of\nexposing private training data through memorization, making\nprivacy-preserving [326] adaptation essential. Promising so-\nlutions include homomorphic instruction tuning [353], which\nprocesses encrypted user queries while maintaining end-to-end\nencryption during inference; differential privacy via reward\nnoising [354], which introduces mathematically bounded noise\ninto RLHF preference rankings during alignment; and federated\ndistillation, which aggregates knowledge from decentralized\nuser-specific models without sharing raw data.\nCollaborative Multi-Model Systems. As single-model\n[355, 356, 357] scaling approaches physical limits, alterna-\ntive paradigms such as multi-agent LLM collaboration [358,\n359, 178] become necessary. Researchers are investigating\nemergent communication protocols that train models to de-\nvelop lossy compression “languages” for inter-model knowl-\nedge transfer such as GenAINet [360], robust ensembles where\nstress-test induced specialization drives automatic division of\nproblem spaces based on failure analysis [361], and gradient-\nfree synergy learning through evolutionary strategies designed\nto discover complementary model combinations without rely-\ning on backpropagation [362].\nMultimodal RL Integration. Multimodal reinforcement\nlearning [363, 49, 364] faces the obstacle of a combinatorial\nstate explosion, especially in contexts exceeding 128k tokens.\nPioneering methods to overcome this include hierarchical\nattention frameworks that employ modality-specific policies\nwith cross-attention gating [365], adaptive truncation strate-\ngies that compress context while preserving critical reasoning\nsegments [366], and flash curriculum approaches that leverage\nself-supervised [367, 368, 369] complexity prediction to facili-\ntate progressive multimodal integration.\nEfficient RL Training. Efficient RL training paradigms con-\ntinue to be a critical research frontier as current meth-\nods exhibit significant sample inefficiency and computational\noverhead. Addressing issues like the overthinking [370, 371]\nphenomenon, where excessive reasoning chains waste valu-\nable computation [145], requires approaches such as partial\nrollout strategies [372], adaptive length penalty mechanisms\nemploying learned compression transformers, and hybrid ar-\nchitectures that combine MCTS with advanced RL optimizers.\nThese innovations are essential for scaling RL to long-context\ntasks while minimizing wasted computational resources.\n. Overthinking Phenomenon: Analysis reveals\n22% wasted computation in reasoning chains\nexceeding optimal reasoning length.\nRL methods exhibit sample inefficiency and computational\noverhead, particularly when scaling to contexts exceeding\n128k tokens. The ‘overthinking’ phenomenon, where models\ngenerate excessively long reasoning chains, further reduces\ntoken efficiency and increases deployment costs [373]. Inves-\ntigate partial rollout strategies with flash attention mech-\nanisms for long-context processing. Develop length penalty\nmechanisms using learned compression transformers for itera-\ntive long2short distillation. Hybrid architectures combining\nMCTS [74] with GRPO [59] could enable better exploration-\nexploitation tradeoffs. Parallel work by Xie et. al. [74] demon-\nstrates promising results through adaptive tree search prun-\ning. Several open challenges persist in the field. Uncertainty\npropagation remains problematic as current confidence es-\ntimators add approximately 18% latency overhead, while\ncatastrophic forgetting results in a degradation of 29% of base\ncapabilities during RL fine-tuning [374]. Moreover, benchmark\nsaturation is an issue, with MMLU scores correlating poorly (r\n= 0.34) with real-world performance [375].\n. Adversarial Vulnerabilities: Stress tests re-\nveal a high success rate on gradient-based\nprompt injections.\n8\nConclusion\nThis survey and tutorial provides a systematic review of post-\ntraining methodologies for LLMs, focusing on fine-tuning, re-\ninforcement learning, and scaling. We analyze key techniques,\nalong with strategies for improving efficiency and alignment\nwith human preferences. Additionally, we explore the role of\nRL in enhancing LLMs through reasoning, planning, and multi-\ntask generalization, categorizing their functionalities within\nthe agent-environment paradigm. Recent advancements in\nreinforcement learning and test-time scaling have significantly\nimproved LLMs reasoning capabilities, enabling them to tackle\nincreasingly complex tasks. By consolidating the latest re-\nsearch and identifying open challenges, we aim to guide future\nefforts in optimizing LLMs for real-world applications.\nReferences\n[1]\nA.

Experiments on public real-world FAH\ndatasets, IsaacGym simulation, and challenging robotic tasks\ndemonstrate that our method significantly improves affordance\nlocalization accuracy, grasp consistency, and generalization\nto unseen tools and tasks, bridging the gap between visual\naffordance learning and dexterous robotic manipulation. The\nsource code and demo videos will be publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/PopeyePxx/MKA.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nFunctional dexterous grasping is a key capability for\nrobots to perform complex object manipulations based on\nhuman instructions. Unlike traditional simple grasping, it\nrequires a robotic dexterous hand to generate diverse grasp-\ning postures and make contact with different object regions\ndepending on the task. This involves intricate physical in-\nteractions between the fingers and the object. For instance,\nin the “Hold Drill” task, the robot’s five fingers must firmly\ngrasp the drill head, while in the “Press Drill” task, the index\nfinger presses the drill switch while the other four fingers\nstabilize the handle. Thus, how to infer task-relevant object\ncontact regions and grasping postures from visual perception\nis a fundamental challenge in functional dexterous grasping.\nIn the field of vision, affordance-based methods [1], [2],\n[3], [4], [5] have been widely explored to predict potential\nhuman interaction regions. Deep-learning-based approaches\nestimate heatmaps [4], [5] or segmentation masks [2], [3] to\nindicate feasible interaction areas. However, existing meth-\nods [6], [7] can only provide coarse region predictions given\n1The authors are with the School of Robotics, Hunan University, China.\n2The authors are also with the National Engineering Research Center of\nRobot Visual Perception and Control Technology, Hunan University, China.\n3The authors are with the College of Computer Science and Electronic\nEngineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China.\n∗Corresponding authors: Wenrui Chen.\n(a) Existing work\n(b) Ours\nGaussian Heatmap\nSegmentation masks\nSingle approximate \narea of interaction\nNo certain \ninteraction pose\n2\n0\n1\nUnique \ninteraction pose\nThe muti-keypoint \ncorresponds to the \nkey MPC joints\n2\n0\n1\nGaussian Heatmap\nKeypoints\nor\n“Press”\nFig. 1: Comparison between existing affordance-based grasping\nmethods and our proposed Multi-Keypoint Affordance representa-\ntion.

A rough affordance map cannot specify\nthe exact interaction posture, leading to uncertainty in the\ngrasping motion and insufficient constraints for functional\ndexterous grasping, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Therefore, how\nto find a novel visual representation that not only identifies\ntask-relevant contact areas but also directly constrains the\ndexterous grasping posture, ensuring a well-defined interac-\ntion between the hand and the object, remains a challenging\nproblem.\nKeypoint-based representations offer a potential solution\nby structuring high-dimensional visual data into a compact\nand interpretable form. Many studies [8], [9], [10], [11]\nhave demonstrated the effectiveness of keypoint-based ap-\nproaches in robotic manipulation, often decomposing grasp-\ning tasks into object and environment keypoints. For in-\nstance, KETO [10] defines three types of keypoints: grasp\npoints, functional points, and operation points. SKP [11]\ndirectly defines five keypoints on the object’s surface to\nsupport parallel grasping. However, these methods exhibit\nlimitations in their visual representation: either the keypoints\nare manually defined for specific tasks, limiting general-\nization to novel objects and tasks, or they rely heavily\non simulated environments for training, reducing their real-\nworld applicability. Additionally, many of these approaches\nrequire extensive manual annotations, further increasing data\ncollection costs.\nTo\nimprove\nthe\ngeneralization\nand\napplicability\nof\nkeypoint-based representations, VRB [12] introduces a more\narXiv:2502.20018v1  [cs.RO]  27 Feb 2025\n\n\nflexible visual representation by learning contact points and\nmotion trajectories from human operation videos, demon-\nstrating enhanced performance in robotic manipulation tasks.\nHowever, this method relies on post-processing steps, and its\nvisual representation remains indirect. More recent advances\nin Large Vision Models (LVM) have significantly improved\nobject feature extraction. For instance, ReKep [13] leverages\nLVMs to automatically extract candidate keypoints, and then\nfilters them using vision-language models, directly guiding\nrobotic operations. This approach enhances task generaliza-\ntion and establishes a more direct link between vision and\naction.\nDespite successes, the above methods primarily focus on\nsimple two-finger pinch grasps and do not extend to dex-\nterous grasping tasks. In dexterous grasping, keypoints must\nnot only determine the grasping location but also constrain\nthe entire hand configuration, ensuring functional stability, as\nshown in Fig. 1(b). Achieving this goal introduces three key\nchallenges: (1) Fine-grained feature extraction: Dexterous\ngrasping involves small, detailed interaction regions between\nfingers and the object. How can part-level keypoint features\nbe extracted from the object? (2) Data annotation cost:\nDexterous grasping requires precise keypoint annotations,\nwhich are costly to acquire. How can reliance on manual\nannotation be reduced? (3) Keypoint correspondence: Es-\ntablishing a consistent mapping between object keypoints\nand hand keypoints is essential for stable grasping. How can\nrobust keypoint correspondence be ensured?\nTo address the challenges, we propose the Multi-KeyPoint\nAffordance representation for Functional Dexterous Grasp-\ning. By localizing multiple keypoints on the object and\nthe hand, a unique dexterous grasping posture with clear\nconstraints is determined. First, we introduce the Contact-\nguided Multi-Keypoint Affordance (CMKA) learning, which\nleverages LVMs (e.g., SAM [14] and DINOv2 [15]) for fine-\ngrained affordance feature extraction. The CMKA supervises\nEgocentric (Ego)-view images using hand-object interaction\nregions in Exocentric (Exo)-view images as contact priors\nvia CAM [16], guiding keypoint learning towards meaningful\nfunctional contact areas and eliminating the need for manual\nkeypoint annotations. Then, we introduce the Keypoint-based\nGrasp matrix Transformation (KGT) method to ensure con-\nsistent mapping between hand and object keypoints. We ob-\nserve that the wrist, functional fingers (index or thumb), and\nlittle finger MCP joints effectively reflect the relative contact\nposture between the hand and the object. The positional\nrelationship of these three points forms a unique triangular\nstructure, providing a direct connection between hand and\nobject keypoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments to\nevaluate the proposed framework for multi-point affordance\nlocalization across 6 tasks and 18 tool shapes on the public\nFAH dataset [17], achieving a 45.35% improvement over\nthe state-of-the-art method in the KLD metric. In both\nIsaacGym [18] and real robot experiments, we successfully\nestablish the geometric constraint relationship between tool\nand hand keypoints.\nThe main contributions of this work are as follows:\n• A novel multi-keypoint affordance representation is\nproposed, which constrains dexterous grasping postures\nthrough the geometric relationships of keypoints in the\nhand-object interaction region, directly establishing a\nlink between vision and dexterous grasping actions.\n• CMKA,\na\nmulti-keypoint\naffordance\nlocalization\nmethod based on a weakly-supervised framework,\nand KGT, a keypoint-based hand-object relative pose\ntransformation\nmethod,\nare\nintroduced,\nleveraging\nexisting human interaction image data and LVMs for\nlearning, effectively reducing data costs, and enabling\nfunctional dexterous grasping.\n• The proposed algorithm is validated in both simulation\nand real robot experiments, demonstrating its ability to\ndirectly map tasks to grasping actions while exhibiting\ngood generalization across tasks and objects, especially\nexcelling in complex functional grasping scenarios.\nII. RELATED WORK\nA. Object Representation for Dexterous Grasping\nGrasping and manipulation are fundamental topics in\nrobotics. Traditional methods [19], [20], [21] often rely on\nsix Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) poses to represent objects\nfor parallel gripper tasks. However, these methods are in-\nsufficient for dexterous grasping, which requires handling\nmultiple contact points and complex interactions beyond\nsimple position and orientation. Early methods such as\nrigid body modeling [22], [23] and template matching [24],\n[25] are task-specific and lack generalization, limiting their\napplicability to diverse tasks. Recent studies have focused\non object structure-based grasp affordance representations,\nsuch as ContactDB [26], which annotates object-finger con-\ntact relationships; the method in [27], which maps contact\npoints to finger regions and intent codes; and F2F [28],\nwhich uses knowledge graphs to associate functional object\nparts with functional fingers. While these methods improve\ntask performance, they depend on ideal perception systems\nthat assume precise segmentation or localization of func-\ntional regions—an assumption rarely achievable in real-\nworld settings. To address these limitations, we propose\na robust object representation method specifically designed\nfor dexterous grasping, eliminating the need for idealized\nperception inputs and enabling reliable handling of complex\ninteractions.\nB. Keypoint Representation and Robotic Manipulation\nKeypoint-based methods have been widely used in com-\nputer vision tasks such as face recognition [29], [30], human\npose estimation [31], and tracking [32], where keypoints\ntypically serve as low-level features or part-level object\ndescriptors. In robotics, keypoints provide compact repre-\nsentations of the environment and objects. For example,\nKETO [10] defines three types of keypoints—grasp points,\nfunctional points, and operation points—to describe tasks,\nwhereas SKP [11] defines five keypoints directly on the\nobject surface to support parallel grasping. However, these\nmethods are task-specific and struggle to generalize to new\n\n\nExo\nEgo\nTransfer\nconstraint\nR,T,J\nControl\nKeypoint\nCMKA\nKGT\nFig. 2: The key process of learning and connecting visual perception to functional dexterous grasping actions. The CMKA learning module\nlearns from Exo images with human operation experience and transfers the knowledge to Ego images, locating three keypoints constrained\nby dexterous grasping. The KGT method maps the hand-object relative pose, calculating the dexterous hand’s rotation and translation\nparameters (R, T) to control the grasping task.\ntasks. Recent advancements in large models have introduced\ngeneralizable representations for robotic manipulation, such\nas ReKep [13], which employs LVMs [15], [14] to extract\ncandidate keypoints and vision-language models to filter\ntask-relevant keypoints for direct operational guidance. How-\never, ReKep [13] focuses on simple parallel gripper tasks\nand requires additional reasoning steps, making it unsuit-\nable for dexterous manipulation. Inspired by human hand\ninteractions [33], we propose a multi-keypoint representation\nbased on the wrist, functional fingers, and the little finger.\nThis design directly constrains dexterous grasping postures,\nproviding effective and robust solutions for complex manip-\nulation tasks.\nC. Visual Affordance and Interaction\nVisual affordance learning explores potential object re-\ngions for specific actions and is a key topic in robotic\ngrasping. Early fully supervised methods [34], [35] relied\non large-scale annotated datasets, which were both expen-\nsive and time-consuming to create. To reduce annotation\ncosts, recent research has shifted toward weakly super-\nvised methods, leveraging keypoints [36], [37] or image-\nlevel labels [4], [38], [39]. In this work, we utilize human\ninteraction images to supervise Ego-view images through\ncontact features, significantly reducing training data costs by\nleveraging existing resources. Existing affordance methods\nfor robotic manipulation, such as VRB [12], learn contact\npoints and trajectories from human operation videos, whereas\nRobo-ABC [40] generates hand-object contact datasets to\nenable zero-shot generalization. Similarly, GAT [7] proposes\npixel-level affordance learning to capture precise regions.\nHowever, these methods often depend on post-processing\nsteps and additional modules, and their affordance regions\nare typically coarse, failing to provide the fine-grained con-\nstraints required for dexterous grasping. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a multi-region keypoint affordance\nlearning approach that directly provides fine-grained con-\nstraints tailored for dexterous grasping tasks.\nIII. METHODOLOGY\nIn this study, our goal is to develop a complete system\nthat establishes a direct visual representation for functional\ndexterous grasping and achieves cross-task and cross-object\ngeneralization. As shown in Fig. 2, during the training\nprocess, the proposed Contact-guided Multi-Keypoint Af-\nfordance (CMKA) learning module acquires human opera-\ntion experience from exocentric (Exo) images and transfers\nit to egocentric (Ego) images, identifying three keypoints\nconstrained by dexterous grasping in the Ego image. The\ndetails of this process will be explained in Sec. III-A. We\nthen use the Keypoint-based Grasp matrix Transformation\n(KGT) method to map and constrain the hand-object relative\npose using these keypoints, calculating the rotation and\ntranslation parameters (R, T) of the dexterous hand, thereby\nenabling control of the grasping task. The relevant details\nwill be further described in Sec. III-B. During the inference\nprocess, only Ego images are required as input, and the\nparameters learned by CMKA can be used to identify the\nthree affordance keypoints of the object.\nA. Contact-guided Multi-KeyPoint Affordances Learning\nTo identify the keypoint regions on the object surface\nwhere the fingers should make contact, robust fine-grained\nfeature extraction is required. To achieve this, as shown in\nFig. 3, we first employ LVM-based Multi-Scale Clustering\n(LMSC) to obtain candidate keypoints from different parts of\nthe object surface (see Sec. III-A.1). Next, we perform key-\npoint feature extraction from the Ego-view (see Sec. III-A.2)\nand design a keypoint weighting learning mechanism, which\ncomputes a weighted score for each candidate keypoint and\nselects the top three keypoints. Then, a keypoint-guided\nfeature extraction module is used to perform deep feature\nextraction on the selected regions in the Ego-view images.\nFinally, we leverage cues from the Exo-view for knowledge\ntransfer of the contact geometry relationship (see Sec. III-\nA.3), using learnable Class Activation Mapping (CAM)\ntechnology [16] to extract hand-object interaction features\nfrom the Exo-view images, and employ cosine similarity\nloss to supervise keypoint selection in the Ego-view images,\nensuring that the selected keypoints are concentrated around\nthe hand-object contact regions.\n1) LVM-based Multi-Scale Clustering Module: Inspired\nby the ReKep [13], we propose an LMSC module, which\naims to focus clustering on finger contact regions, as shown\n\n\n𝐹\n𝑒𝑔𝑜\n𝑓𝑘𝑖\nKeypoint-guided \nFeature Extract\nKeypoints \nlearnable weights \n...\nX\nLVM-based \nMulti-Scale \nClustering\nEgo\n“Press”\nDINOv2\nSelect\n𝐹\n𝑒𝑥𝑜\nExo\n𝝋cam\nExtract\n…\nPartSelect\nLOCATE\nSum\nℒ𝑐𝑙𝑠\nℒ𝑐𝑜𝑠\n1\n2\n3\n0\n1\n2\n5\n3\n4\nN\nlearnable\nfixed\nDINOv2\n𝑓𝑔𝑘\n𝑓𝑜𝑝\nFig. 3: Framework of the proposed CMKA. The framework includes: (1) a LVM-based Multi-Scale Clustering (LMSC) module for\nextracting candidate keypoints; (2) Keypoint feature extraction from egocentric (Ego) view; (3) Contact geometry knowledge transfer from\nexocentric (Exo) view to Ego view.\nSAM\n𝑀1\n𝑀2\n𝑀3\nClustering\nPCA\nMulti-scale feature fusion\nEgo\n𝐹𝑒𝑔𝑜\n0\n1\n2\n5\n3\n4\nN\nLayer\nLayer\n…\nLinear\nFusion\nMLP\nBilinear\nSum\n𝑓′\n𝐾𝑐𝑛\n𝐹\n𝑓\nFig. 4: Candidate keypoint selection using the proposed LMSC\nmodule.\nin Fig. 4.\nFirst, we extract multi-level features from multiple inter-\nmediate layers of the DINOv2 model [15] to capture informa-\ntion from low to high levels. Specifically, we extract features\nfrom the first three layers, denoted as Fli (where i = 1,2,3)\nand apply linear transformations and normalization to each\nlayer. Next, a learnable weight vector αi is used to perform\nweighted fusion, where the weights are normalized using\nthe softmax function. The final fused feature representation\nis obtained as:\nF =\n3\n∑\ni=1\nαiFli.\nThen, F is passed through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)\nto obtain the feature representation f. To further incorporate\nmulti-scale information, we perform upsampling and down-\nsampling on f to obtain f↑and f↓, respectively. The final\nmulti-scale feature representation is obtained by summation:\nf ′ = f + f↓+ f↑.\nMeanwhile, recent vision foundation models like Segment\nAnything Model\n[14] (SAM) have demonstrated strong\ncapacity to produce robust zero-shot segmentation in real-\nworld scenes. we apply SAM [14] to the Ego-view image\nto obtain multi-region masks Mi and perform region-wise\nclustering on the multi-scale feature representation f ′ us-\ning the non-background masks. Specifically, we first apply\nPCA to reduce the dimensionality of each region’s features,\nobtaining the reduced feature representation XPCA ∈Rn×k,\nwhere n is the number of pixels in the region and k is the\nreduced dimension. Then, we perform K-means clustering on\nthe reduced features to obtain multiple candidate keypoints\nKcn, selecting the center of each cluster as the final candidate\nkeypoint. The clustering aims to minimize the distance\nbetween samples and cluster centers:\nKcn = argmin\nC\nn\n∑\ni=1\n∥X(i)\nPCA −Cj∥2,\nwhere Kcn represents the n-th candidate keypoint, Cj is the\ncenter of the j-th cluster, and X(i)\nPCA is the feature of the i-th\nsample in the region. Finally, we select the center of each\ncluster as the candidate keypoint. If no valid candidates are\nfound, the pixel closest to the object centroid is chosen as a\nfallback keypoint.\n2) Keypoint Feature Extraction from Egocentric View: To\nextract keypoint features from the Ego view image, we define\na set of learnable weights W ∈Rt×n, where t represents\nthe number of task types and n is the number of candidate\nkeypoints. These weights are multiplied with the candidate\nkeypoints Kcn to select the three keypoints Ki (where i =\n1,2,3) for feature extraction from the corresponding regions\nin the Ego view image.\nFor the selected keypoints Ki, we define a circular region\ncentered at each keypoint with a radius r and extract features\nfrom these regions. The extracted region features are denoted\nas Fki, representing the features from the regions centered on\nthe selected keypoints.\nTo align the features from the Ego and Exo views in a\nunified feature space, we apply a linear transformation to the\nextracted keypoint features Fki, resulting in the final keypoint\nfeatures fop:\nfki = proj(Fki),\nwhere the projection layer proj is a linear transformation that\nmaps the Ego view features to the feature space aligned with\n\n\nI\n𝒙𝒊\n𝒚𝒊\n𝒛𝒊\nF\nL\nW\n𝒚𝒉\nH\n𝒛𝒉\n𝒙𝒉\nO\n𝒚𝒐\n𝒙𝒐\n𝒛𝒐\n𝑾𝑶\n𝑳𝒐\n𝑭𝒐\nAdjust\n𝑾𝑶\n𝑳𝒐\n𝑭𝒐\n(a)\n(b)\n𝑲𝟎\n𝑲𝟐\n𝑲𝟏\nFig. 5: Illustration of KGT method in IsaacGym [18], showing the\nkeypoints on the object and the hand (functional finger, little finger,\nand wrist) and their role in coordinate frame construction.\nthe Exo view.\n3) Contact Geometry Knowledge Transfer: In the final\nstep, we utilize the CAM technique [16] to classify Exo’s\nfeatures for the specific task, with the classification loss\ndenoted as Lcls. Additionally, we extract object features from\nthe interactive regions using the Extract and PartSelect [38]\nmodules, obtaining the prototype features fop for the key-\npoint regions.\nFor the three keypoint features fi extracted from the Ego\nview, we compute their sum to obtain the global keypoint\nfeature fgk, which encapsulates the contact geometry infor-\nmation from the Ego perspective:\nfgk =\n3\n∑\ni=1\nfki.\nNext, we calculate the cosine similarity loss Lcos between\nthe Exo prototype features fop and the global Ego keypoint\nfeatures fgk:\nLcos = 1−\nfop · fgk\n∥fop∥∥fgk∥.\nThe final loss is the combination of the classification\nloss and the cosine similarity loss, ensuring that the contact\ngeometry knowledge is accurately transferred between the\ntwo views:\nL = Lcls +Lcos.\nB. Keypoint-based Grasp Matrix Transformation\nAfter obtaining the three keypoints Ki on the object, we\napply the KGT to obtain the relative pose transformation\nmatrix (R,T) between the dexterous hand and the tool.\nSpecifically, as shown in the Fig. 5 (a), we take K0 as the\nreference point, determine the direction from K0 to K1, and\nform a plane using K0, K1, and K2. Based on the hand model\n(yellow triangle), we adjust the keypoints, resulting in the\ncorrected contact points positions in the world coordinate\nsystem Fo, Lo, and Wo.\nThen, as shown in the Fig. 5 (b), we define the object\ncoordinate system O with Wo as the origin, the x-axis as\nxo =\n−−−→\nWoFo\n∥−−−→\nWoFo∥, the z-axis as zo =\n−−−→\nWoFo×−−−→\nWoLo\n∥−−−→\nWoFo×−−−→\nWoLo∥, and the y-axis\nas yo = zo ×xo, leading to the object rotation matrix in the\nworld coordinate system:\nRI\nO = [xo,yo,zo].\nAt the same time, obtain the transformation matrix between\nthe world coordinate system I and the object coordinate\nsystem O:\nT I\nO =\n\u0014\nRI\nO\nWo\n0\n1\n\u0015\nSimilarly, the hand coordinate system H is defined with W\nas the origin, the x-axis as xh =\n−−→\nWF\n∥−−→\nWF∥, the z-axis as zh =\n−−→\nWF×−→\nWL\n∥−−→\nWF×−→\nWL∥, and the y-axis as yh = zh × xh, where F, L, and\nW represent the keypoints positions on the hand in the world\ncoordinate system, yielding the hand rotation matrix:\nRI\nH = [xh,yh,zh].\nThe relative rotation matrix between the hand and the object\nis then computed as:\nR = (RI\nO)−1RI\nH,\nwhile the translation vector is given by:\nT = (T I\nO)−1(W −Wo).\nIV. EXPERIMENTS\nA. Setup\nDatasets: The public challenging FAH benchmark [17]\nis a large-scale affordance-annotated dataset specifically de-\nsigned for hand-object interactions. It contains 6 functional\ngrasp affordances and 18 tools, with 5,858 images spanning\nboth exocentric (Exo) and egocentric (Ego) views. The\ndataset provides image-level affordance labels for weakly\nsupervised learning and annotations for coarse dexterous\ngrasp gestures targeting specific “Task Tool” pairs. However,\nits test set only includes heatmap annotations for functional\nfinger contact regions. To address this limitation, we sparsely\nannotate two additional contact points (little finger and\nwrist projection points). Specifically, polygons with up to\nfive points are constructed around finger keypoints within\na 5mm radius, and Gaussian kernels are applied at each\npoint to generate dense annotations. During training, point\nannotations are added to the object regions in each Ego-\nview image to distinguish foreground and background during\nsegmentation with SAM [14].\nImplementation Details: Experiments are conducted on\nan NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU. The model is trained using\nthe SGD optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01 over 15\niterations. Images are resized to a resolution of 448×448.\nFollowing prior works [38], [4], we evaluate the results using\nKullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), Similarity (SIM), and\nNormalized Scanpath Saliency (NSS) metrics.\nB. Results of Functional Affordance Grounding\nIn this section, we present qualitative and quantitative\nresults to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our\nmethod on the FAH test set [17]. As weakly- or unsupervised\nmethods for multi-region affordance localization are scarce\nin the state of the art, we use ReKep* [13], a keypoint\nprediction method, as our baseline.\n\n\nGT\nOurs\nReKep\n“Press”\n“Click”\n“Grip”\n“Clamp”\n“Press”\nImage\n“Clamp”\n“Hold”\n“Hold”\nFig. 6: Qualitative comparison between our approach and the state-of-the-art multi-keypoint affordance grounding method (ReKep* [13])\non the FAH test set [17]. Our proposed method predicts keypoints that are more concentrated in the contact areas and captures the\ngeometric information of the grasping posture.\nTABLE I: Comparison to state-of-the-art method on the FAH test\nset [17].

As shown in Tab. I, our method sig-\nnificantly outperforms ReKep* [13] across multiple metrics.\nSpecifically, it improves KLD by 45.35%, increases SIM by\n54.19%, and improves NSS by 101.63%. These improve-\nments stem from ReKep*’s lack of adaptation to dexterous\ngrasping. While ReKep* [13] originally relies on manually\nselected keypoints, its modified version ReKep* [13] ran-\ndomly generates three keypoints without explicit modeling\nof functional contact regions. In contrast, our method em-\nploys a learnable weighting mechanism to generate keypoints\nspecifically for dexterous grasping, ensuring their alignment\nwith functional contact regions.\nHyperparameter Analysis. We further investigate the\nimpact of the candidate keypoint number N={6,9,12,15}\non model performance, In Tab. II, we show the effects\nof different values on KLD, SIM, and NSS. The results\nindicate that N=12 achieves the best performance across\nall metrics. This aligns with our design principle: too few\nkeypoints lead to insufficient representation of affordance\nregions, hindering fine-grained grasp modeling, while too\nmany introduce redundancy, diluting feature importance and\nreducing the model’s focus on functional regions.\nAblation Study. The object priors provided by SAM [14]\nare crucial for constraining keypoint proposals to objects in\nthe scene rather than the background. Thus, we focus on\nanalyzing the critical visual feature extraction network in\nTABLE II: Impact of the candidate keypoint number N.\nN\nKLD (↓)\nSIM (↑)\nNSS (↑)\n6\n5.409\n0.308\n0.849\n9\n5.748\n0.282\n0.737\n12\n5.035\n0.313\n0.865\n15\n5.766\n0.279\n0.723\nTABLE III: Ablation study on different feature extractors.

As shown in Tab. III, DINOv2 [15], as the backbone\nnetwork combined with our designed multi-scale feature\nfusion (MSFF) module, achieves the best performance. In\nthe backbone network, DINOv2 generates clearer features\ncompared to DINO-ViT [41], better distinguishing fine-\ngrained object regions and leading to improved performance.\nFurthermore, compared to replacing MSFF with a simple\nfully connected network, MSFF, with its multi-layer and\nmulti-scale feature mapping, demonstrates superior potential.\nQualitative Analysis. As shown in Fig. 6, the visibility\ngrounding visualizations include Ground Truth (GT), our\nmethod, and the baseline method ReKep* [13]. Compared\nto the baseline, our method localizes keypoints within the\nhand-object contact region while preserving the relative\nspatial relationships among the functional finger, little finger,\nand wrist projection, ensuring a meaningful distribution for\ndexterous grasping. For example, in the “Click Flashlight”\ntask, keypoint 0 is localized on the thumb and keypoint 1\n\n\n（a）“Press Drill ”\n（b）“Hold Drill ”\n（c）“Click Flashlight ”\n（d）“Hold Flashlight ”\nFig. 7: Visualization of initial and final hand-object states in\nIsaacGym [18] for different “Task Tool” combinations.

In contrast, ReKep* [13] relies on manual post-\nprocessing, failing to constrain keypoints within the contact\nregion and lacking spatial consistency, resulting in scattered\nkeypoints and reduced accuracy of the affordance region.\nC. Evaluation of Keypoint-Based Grasp Transformation\nTo validate the effectiveness of the keypoint-based dex-\nterous grasp transformation method KGT, we conduct ex-\nperiments on four “Task Tool” combinations: “Press Drill”,\n“Hold Drill”, “Click Flashlight”, and “Hold Flashlight”.\nAs shown in Fig. 7, we visualized the initial and final hand-\nobject states in the simulation environment IsaacGym [18].\nThe results demonstrate that our method accurately computes\nthe grasp transformation matrix, enabling precise hand-object\ninteraction across different task-tool combinations with vary-\ning initial hand-object relative postures. For functional inter-\naction tasks, such as “Press Drill” and “Click Flashlight”,\nthe method ensures correct contact between the functional\nfingers and the target components. For general grasping\ntasks, such as “Hold”, our method achieves a natural grasp,\nensuring a reasonable hand posture.\nInitial\nLocation\nAdjust\nControl\nw\n4/5（3/5）\n3/5（0/5）\n2/5（0/5）\n𝑊𝑜\n𝐹𝑜\n𝐿𝑜\n𝐹𝑜\n𝐿𝑜\n𝑊𝑜\n(R,T)\n𝑊𝑜\n𝐿𝑜\n𝐹𝑜\n(R,T)\n(R,T)\nFig. 9: Experiments with three typical “Task Tools” in real-world\nscenarios: “Click Flashlight”, “Press Drill” and “Press Spraybottle”\n(from top to bottom). The upper right corner of the fourth column\ncompares the functional dexterous grasping success rate with our\nmethod and GAAF-Dex [17] (in bracket), where the total grasp\nnumber of each instance is 5.\nD. Performance in Real-World Scenarios\nReal-world Experiments Setup: As shown in Fig. 8(a),\nthe real-world platform consists of an Inspire hand, a UR5\nindustrial robotic arm, an Intel RealSense camera, a tool rack,\nand a control computer. To address real-world uncertainties,\nwe introduce keypoint relative position calibration annota-\ntions based on the Inspire model during the grasping process,\nas shown in Fig. 8(b).\nIn the experiments, we use tool instances commonly found\nin daily life, which were unseen in the training set. As shown\nin Fig. 9, we selected three “Task Tool” with strict functional\ngrasping requirements for the experiment: “Click Flashlight”,\n“Press Drill”, and “Press Spraybottle”. We recorded four\nstates: the initial state, followed by the localization of three\naffordance keypoints on the tool surface using the CMKA\nmethod to estimate their initial planar relationship. Simulta-\nneously, we utilized an RGB-D camera to obtain the depth z\nfrom the (x,y) coordinates of the keypoints in the depth map,\nthus acquiring their (x,y,z) coordinates in 3D space. We then\nadjusted the relative geometric positions of the keypoints on\nthe dexterous hand palm using calibration standards (yellow\ntriangles in the third column). Finally, we apply the KGT\nmethod to compute the final wrist grasp pose W(R,T), and\nuse the coarse gesture labels from the FAH [17] to obtain\nthe coarse grasp angle J for each “Task Tool,\" which controls\nthe final grasping of the dexterous hand.\nThe results demonstrate that for complex tasks requiring\nprecise finger-object alignment, such as Press and Click,\nour method effectively bridges the gap between multi-point\nperception and dexterous grasping, showing broad practi-\ncal value. Furthermore, due to the lack of direct methods\ncombining perception and dexterous grasping, we compared\nour method with the state-of-the-art GAAF-Dex [17] by\nthe number of successful functional grasps. We define a\nsuccessful grasp as the functional finger combining with\nthe tool’s functional component while the remaining fingers\nsecurely grasp other parts of the tool. As shown in the top left\n\n\ncorner of Fig. 9, our method improves the grasp success rate\nby an average of 40% across three complex tasks. GAAF-\nDex [17] is only effective when the initial and final grasp\nrotations are similar, such as in the Click Flashlight scenario,\ndue to its lack of adaptive rotation handling. In contrast, our\nmethod can handle arbitrary initial grasp poses.\nV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nThis work proposes a keypoint-based affordance repre-\nsentation for functional dexterous grasping. By leveraging\nhuman experience data for weak supervision and inte-\ngrating the CMKA module with large visual models, our\napproach achieves precise multi-point contact localization,\nreducing data annotation costs and improving generaliza-\ntion. The KGT method enables the mapping of dexterous\nhand postures to object keypoints, ensuring a direct con-\nnection between perception and action. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing\napproaches in localization accuracy and functional grasp\nsuccess rate. Practical experiments show that relying solely\non 2D vision for localization fails to provide stable grasp\nconstraints. In the future, we aim to utilize multimodal\ninformation to enhance the accuracy and stability of multi-\npoint 3D localization in real-world scenarios.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J. J.

{"text": "Self Consistent Field Theory of isotropic-nematic inter-\nfaces and disclinations in a semiflexible molecule nematic\nLongyu Qing and Jorge Viñals\nA Self Consistent Field Theory description of equilibrium, but non uniform, configurations adopted\nby semi flexible liquid crystal molecules is presented. Two cases are considered, isotropic-nematic\nphase boundaries, and topological defects in the nematic phase (disclinations).\nNematogens are\nmodeled by worm-like chains, with microscopic interaction potential of the Maier-Saupe type, with\nan added isotropic excluded volume contribution. The thermodynamic fields obtained by numerical\nminimization of the free energy are the molecular density and the nematic tensor order parameter.\nInterfaces with both homeotropic and planar alignment are studied, as well as biaxiality and anisotropy\naround ±1/2 disclinations. The effects induced by fluid compressibility, interaction strength, and\nelastic anisotropy that follows from chain flexibility on both types of non uniform configurations are\ndiscussed. Defect core sizes decrease as the system becomes less compressible, eventually reaching\na constant value in the incompressible limit. The core size is influenced by the nematic interaction\nstrength u2 and chain persistence length lp, decreasing as the order increases in the nematic region\nthrough manipulation of lp and u2. Additionally, when the far field nematic order is fixed, the core\nsize increases with lp.\n1\nIntroduction\nSelf Consistent Field Theory (SCFT) is a well established tech-\nnique for the study of the equilibrium properties of polymer and\nblock copolymer melts by computing energy and entropy contri-\nbutions to the partition function that arise from chain architec-\nture, flexibility, and intermolecular interactions1,2. Of particular\ninterest here are systems comprising semi flexible chains that as-\nsemble into nematic and smectic ordered phases3–6. Our anal-\nysis is motivated by growing interest in orientationally ordered\nand often active fluids, including bio polymeric systems. In many\ncases, the molecular constituents are quite complex, and remain\npoorly characterized. Therefore the resulting elastic anisotropy\nof the medium, and its often unusual rheology remain largely un-\nexplored. Self Consistent Field Theory offers a potential avenue\nfor the exploration of elasticity and the structure of topological\ndefects in the types of molecular assemblies that are the focus\nof current active and biological matter research. Our work pre-\nsented below is our first step in that direction, and focuses on\nthe structure of topological defects in a nematic phase compris-\ning semi flexible molecular units.\nThe free energy of elastic distortion from a uniform nematic\nphase is given, to lowest order, by three modes of deformation:\nsplay, twist, and bend7.\nThe starting point of many theoreti-\ncal analyses of nematics, however, is the so called one constant\napproximation according to which splay, twist, and bend elas-\ntic constants are assumed to be equal.\nThis renders the ne-\nmatic elastically isotropic, a reasonably good approximation for\nsmall molecule, thermotropic liquid crystals. On the other hand,\nthe response of the so called lyotropic liquid crystals (longer\nmolecule nematogens in solution, where the isotropic to nematic\nSchool of Physics and Astronomy, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455,\nUSA.\ntransition is induced by concentration change) is quite different.\nBroad classes that are being studied at present include lyotropic\nchromonics8,9, and nematic micelles10. In both cases, the twist\nelastic constant is as much as one order of magnitude smaller than\nbend and twist. Such a large contrast gives rise to unexpected\nphenomenology, including, for example, spontaneous chiral sym-\nmetry breaking under confinement11? ? –13. Additional research\non nematic response in systems with complex molecular units in-\nclude, for example, actin networks14, the role of nematic order\nin cellular mechano adaptation15, or growth of gliomas in the\nbrain16. Theoretical tools are needed to describe potentially de-\nfected nematics exhibiting large elastic anisotropy, and with com-\nplex molecular architecture and rheology. Given the successes of\nSelf Consistent Field Theory in the polymer field, we begin here\nby examining the effects of fluid compressibility and molecular\nflexibility on complex configurations of a nematic phase that in-\nvolve phase boundaries and topological defects.\nIn the related case of worm like chains, it is known that\nboth persistence (lp) and chain lengths (L) determine the elastic\nanisotropy of the nematic phase17. Polymer field theory work18\nshows that the bend elastic constant (K3) is larger than the splay\nconstant (K1) for rigid chains(L ≪lp), while the splay constants\nis larger for flexible chains (L ≫lp), indicating a crossover be-\ntween splay and bend contrast as chain flexibility changes. For a\nwide range of flexibility, the twist elastic constant (K2) is smaller\nthan both splay and bend18,19. In particular, K2/K1,3 becomes\nsmall when L ≫lp. Hence, inclusion of nematogen flexibility into\nthe theory naturally leads to elastic anisotropy.\nIn addition to\nconsidering chain flexibility, we introduce a molecular interaction\npotential of the Maier-Saupe type, supplemented by an isotropic\nexcluded volume term. This allows a simultaneous study of an\ninteraction inducing nematic order, and of fluid compressibility.\nAs expected, we find that increasing density favors nematic order.\nThe same effect follows by increasing the persistence length. For\n1–10 | 1\narXiv:2502.21218v1  [cond-mat.soft]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\nthe case of an isotropic-nematic interface at coexistence, SCFT\ncorrectly predicts biaxiality in the interfacial region when the\nalignment is planar, and uniaxiality and a wider interface in the\ncase of homeotropic alignment. We also show that the interfacial\nwidth increases with persistence length. Disclinations are also\ncorrectly reproduced within the theory, including a region of bi-\naxiality near the core, crossing over to a uniaxial core. While\nthe molecular density around the defect core depends strongly on\nsystem compressibility and the value of the Maier-Saupe interac-\ntion coefficient, the nematic order parameter is largely insensitive\nto the system compressibility. Finally, the angular dependence of\nthe eigenvalues of the tensor order parameter found around ±1/2\ndisclinations is consistent with the elastic anisotropy induced by\nthe flexible chains, in agreement with experiments20, and with\ncalculations based on the singular potential method21.\n2\nSelf Consistent Field Theory\nIn this section, and for completeness, we briefly summarize our\nimplementation of the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) for\nsemiflexible molecules with Maier-Saupe interaction.\nSimilar\nderivations can be found in Ref.6,22. The molecules are approxi-\nmated by worm-like chains characterized by a contour length Lc,\nand a persistence length lp. Each chain consists of Ns segments\nor monomers. For a collection of n worm-like chains confined\nwithin volume V at temperature T, the configuration of the i-th\nchain is described by a space curve ri(s), where s (0 ≤s ≤1) is\na normalized contour variable that denotes the location of a seg-\nment along the chain. The unit tangent vector ui(s) = dri/(Lcds)\ngives the orientation of the segment s. The microscopic density of\nsegment position and orientation is defined as\nˆφ(r,u) = V\nn\nn\n∑\ni=1\nZ 1\n0 ds δ(r−ri(s))δ(u−ui(s))\n(1)\nwhich is dimensionless and satisfies the normalization condition\nR dr\nR du ˆφ(r,u) = V. For a spatially homogeneous system, the av-\nerage density φ(r,u) = ⟨ˆφ(r,u)⟩is independent of r, where ⟨.⟩\ndenotes a thermal average. Consequently, the normalization con-\ndition then implies that the average density, when integrated over\nall orientations, satisfies φ(r) =\nR duφ(r,u) = 1. In contrast, for\ninhomogeneous systems, the local average density at r may take\nvalues that are greater or less than one.\nThe energy of the system consists of a bending energy\nof individual nematoges, monomer-monomer interactions and\nmonomer-solvent interactions. The solvent is treated implicitly,\nand the monomer-monomer interactions are assumed to follow\nthe Maier-Saupe model. The Hamiltonian of the system is given\nby\nβH = lp\n2Lc\nn\n∑\ni=1\nZ 1\n0 ds\n\f\f\f\f\ndui(s)\nds\n\f\f\f\f\n2\n+\n1\n2\nn2\nV 2\nZ\ndr\nZ\ndr′\nZ\ndu\nZ\ndu′ ˆφ(r,u)V(r,r′;u,u′) ˆφ(r′,u′)\n(2)\nwhere β = 1/kBT, and the kernel function V(r,r′;u,u′) = δ(r −\nr′){u0 −u2[(u · u′)2 −1\n3]} in the present study. The excluded vol-\nume parameter u0 quantifies the strength of the isotropic inter-\naction, and u2 quantifies the strength of the anisotropic Maier-\nSaupe (MS) interaction. The resulting partition function, after a\nHubbard-Stratonovich transformation, is\nZ ∝\nZ\nDφ\nZ\nDwexp(−βF[φ,w])\n(3)\nwith a free energy functional given by,\nβF[φ,w] = −n\nV\nZ\ndr\nZ\ndu w(r,u)φ(r,u)−nlnZ1[w]+nln( n\nV )+nF0\n+ 1\n2\nn2\nV 2\nZ\ndr\nZ\ndr′\nZ\ndu\nZ\ndu′φ(r,u)V(r,r′;u,u′)φ(r′,u′)\n(4)\nwhere F0 is a constant that is independent of n and V, and Z1[w] is\nthe normalized single chain partition function that is a functional\nof any specified external field w(r,u). Note that this functional,\nas defined, is non local. Hence the free energy functional of Eq.\n(4) cannot be written as an integral, over the entire system, of a\nfree energy density. Next, a saddle point approximation assumes\nthat the extremal configurations [φ∗,w∗] dominate the functional\nintegral defining the partition function, and are defined by,\nδ(βF)\nδφ\n\f\f\f\f\nφ=φ ∗,w=w∗= 0,\nδ(βF)\nδw\n\f\f\f\f\nφ=φ ∗,w=w∗= 0.\n(5)\nThus the free energy is approximated by F[φ∗,w∗]. The saddle\npoint approximation yields the relations\nw(r,u) = n\nV\nZ\ndr′\nZ\ndu′V(r,r′;u,u′)φ(r′,u′)\n= n\nV\nZ\ndu′\n\u0014\nu0 −u2[(u·u′)2 −1\n3]\n\u0015\nφ(r′,u′)\nφ(r,u) = −V δ lnZ1[w]\nδw\n(6)\nfor the two thermodynamically independent fields w(r,u) and\nφ(r,u). Notably, the second equation involves solving for a sin-\ngle chain in external field w(r,u)\nφ(r,u) =\nZ 1\n0 dsφ(r,u,s)\n=\n1\n4πZ1[w]\nZ 1\n0 dsq(r,−u,1−s;[w])q(r,u,s;[w])\n(7)\nwhere the propagator q is a functional of w(r,u), satisfying the\nmodified diffusion equation (MDE)\n∂q(r,u,s;[w])\n∂s\n=\n\u0012 Lc\n2lp\n∇2\nu −Lcu·∇r −w(r,u)\n\u0013\nq,\n(8)\nwith initial condition q(r,u,s = 0;[w]) = 1. The normalized single\nchain partition function is given by\nZ1[w] =\n1\n4πV\nZ\ndr\nZ\nduq(r,u,s = 1;[w])\n(9)\nThe equilibrium solutions are determined self consistently accord-\ning to Eqs. 6. It means that the interaction between molecules for\n2 |\n1–10\n\n\na configuration φ(r,u) creates an effective field w(r,u). This gen-\nerated field in turn self consistently determines the configuration\nφ(r,u). The equilibrium states are obtained when both self con-\nsistency conditions are simultaneously satisfied.\nThe nematic order parameter tensor is obtained from φ(r,u)\nthrough\nQ(r) =\nR du φ(r,u)\n\u0000u⊗u−1\n3I\n\u0001\nR du φ(r,u)\n(10)\nwhere I is the rank 3 identity tensor. The denominator is needed\nfor normalization in the case of inhomogeneous states where the\nlocal density φ(r) is not uniform.\nIn order to reduce the computational complexity, we expand all\nu dependent quantities in terms of real spherical harmonics6,23.\nThe real spherical harmonic expansion of an arbitrary function\nf(r,u) is written as\nf(r,u) = ∑\nl,m\nf m\nl (r)˜Y m\nl (u)\n(11)\nwhere f can be q(r,u,s), w(r,u) and φ(r,u). The MDE can then\nbe written in terms of the spherical harmonic expansion as,\n∂qm\nl\n∂s = −Lc\n2lp\nl(l +1)qm\nl −Lc\nr\n4π\n3 Gmαmm2\n1ll2\n∂qm2\nl2\n∂xα\n−Gmm1m2\nll1l2\nwm1\nl1 qm2\nl2\n(12)\nwhere the real Gaunt coefficients are defined as Gm1m2m3\nl1l2l3\n=\nR du˜Y m1\nl1 (u)˜Y m2\nl2 (u)˜Y m3\nl3 (u)23, the integral of products of three real\nspherical harmonics over u.\nThe resulting convection diffu-\nsion equation for the coefficients is solved with a Lax-Wendroff\nmethod24, with a step size in contour length ∆s. The coordinate\nspace is divided into evenly spaced lattice points, (xi,y j,zk). A\nfield f(r,u) is represented by its expansion coefficients defined\non lattice points, f m\nl (xi,yj,zk). In the computations below, we re-\nstrict the expansion to order l = 4. The first equation in the system\n(6) leads to linear equations following the expansion6\nw0\n0(r) = 4πu0\nn\nV φ0\n0 (r)\nwm\n2 (r) = −4πu2\n5\nn\nV φm\n2 (r)\n(13)\nwhere all other components l ̸= 0,2 are zero. Therefore, the ex-\npansion in real spherical harmonics greatly reduces the number\nof degrees of freedom of the theory. The expansion also allows\nus to write the order parameter tensor in terms of the coefficients\nφm\nl , following the definition in Eq.(10)\nQ =\n1\n3\n√\n5φ0\n0\n\n\n\n−φ0\n2 +\n√\n3φ2\n2\n√\n3φ−2\n2\n√\n3φ1\n2\n√\n3φ−2\n2\n−φ0\n2 −\n√\n3φ2\n2\n√\n3φ−1\n2\n√\n3φ1\n2\n√\n3φ−1\n2\n2φ0\n2\n\n\n\n(14)\nwhere only l = 0,2 terms are nonzero due to the definition of\nQ. The five degrees of freedom for l = 2 are sufficient for Q to\ndescribe general biaxial order. As is done often, we parametrize\nthe tensor order parameter as\nQ = S(ˆn⊗ˆn−1\n3I)+P( ˆm⊗ˆm−ˆl⊗ˆl)\n(15)\nwhere ˆn, ˆm and ˆl are an orthonormal triad of eigenvectors of\nQ. The director ˆn is the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue.\nThe constant S is the uniaxial order parameter, and P the biaxial\norder parameter. Their relationship with the eigenvalues of Q is,\n(λn,λm,λl) = ( 2\n3S,−1\n3S+P,−1\n3S−P).\nThere are only a limited number of cases in which the prop-\nagator can be obtained analytically, so a numerical solution to\nthe MDE is usually necessary. In this work, in order to find ap-\nproximate saddle point solutions (Eq. (5)), an iterative method\nis used with the following steps. Step 1: Define an initial guess\nfor the input fields wm\nl(in)(xi,yj,zk). Step 2: Solve the MDE nu-\nmerically to find the propagator qm\nl (xi,yj,zk,s;[wm\nl ]), and compute\nZ1[w], φm\nl (xi,yj,zk), and other thermodynamic quantities accord-\ningly. Step 3: Compute the output fields wm\nl(out)(xi,yj,zk) accord-\ning to the first equation in (6). Step 4: Define the absolute dif-\nference between the input and the output fields to be the er-\nror.\nWhen the maximum error among all the expansion com-\nponents and space points is smaller than a given tolerance, i.e.,\nmax(|wm\nl(out)(xi,yj,zk)−wm\nl(in)(xi,yj,zk)|) < ε, the iteration is ended.\nOtherwise, the input field is updated by using the Picard iteration\nmethod4,5, and going back to step 2. The current work obtains\nnumerical solutions using Python? .\n3\nUniform states and isotropic-nematic phase tran-\nsition\nWe first briefly review the equilibrium phase behavior provided by\nthe SCFT. We have used ∆s = 1/100 in all our calculations. Unless\notherwise specified, we set u0 = 10, Lc = lp = 1, and n/V = 1.\nThe normalization condition requires φ(r) = 1 and hence φ0\n0 (r) =\n1/\n√\n4π. Without loss of generality, we consider that the phase\ntransition is from the isotropic phase to a uniaxial nematic phase\nalong the ˆz direction, so that φm\n2 is non vanishing only for m = 0\nin the nematic phase.\nHence Eq.(14) gives the uniaxial order\nparameter S =\nq\n4π\n5 φ0\n2 .\nAs described in Sec. 2, an iterative method is generally neces-\nsary to compute SCFT solutions from an appropriate initial guess.\nFor a uniform configuration, and to the order of approximation\nin spherical harmonics that we are using, there is a more direct\nmethod. There are only two variables that need to be determined,\nw0\n2 and φ0\n2 . The free energy per chain as a function of w0\n2 and φ0\n2\nis then given by,\nβF[φ0\n2 ,w0\n2]\nn\n= F0 −lnZ1[w0\n2]−w0\n2φ0\n2 −1\n2\nn\nV\n4πu2\n5\n(φ0\n2 )2\n(16)\nwhere all constants are absorbed into F0. The resulting free en-\nergy is shown in Fig.1(a) for u2 = 9.882, the isotropic-nematic\nphase transition point. The black solid line illustrates the station-\nary condition δ(βF)\nδφ 0\n2\n= 0, whereas the dashed line corresponds to\nδ(βF)\nδw0\n2\n= 0. The saddle points are at the intersections of the solid\nand dashed lines. The equilibrium free energy per chain along the\nsolid line (w0\n2 = −4πu2\n5\nn\nV φ0\n2 ) displays a characteristic double well\nshape, and it is shown in Fig. 1(b) for different values of u2, and\nas a function of the uniaxial order parameter S. The saddle points\ncorresponds to the minima of this function. The minimum at S = 0\ncorresponds to the isotropic phase, and the minimum at S ̸= 0 cor-\nresponds to the nematic phase. The figure illustrates how, as u2\nincreases, the global minimum changes from the isotropic phase\n1–10 | 3\n\n\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFig. 1 (a) and (b)Free energy per chain of bulk state, where F0 is chosen to make the free energy of isotropic phase zero. (a) shows the free energy\nper chain as function of φ0\n2 and w0\n2 at the phase transition u2 = 9.882, where the black solid line and dashed line correspond to the conditions δ(βF)\nδφ0\n2\n= 0\nand δ(βF)\nδw0\n2 = 0, respectively. The three inset plots provide the enlarged view near the intersections. (b) shows the free energy per chain along the black\nsolid line for different values of u2. (c) and (d) Equilibrium uniaxial order S as a function of u2 for different chain number densities and flexibilities\nto the nematic phase, indicating a first order phase transition. The\nequilibrium uniaxial order parameter S as a function of MS inter-\naction coefficient u2 can be obtained from the minimum the free\nenergy. The value of u2 at the phase transition depends on combi-\nnations of parameters: Chain number density n/V and ratio Lc/lp,\nwhile it is independent of u0. Fig.1(c)(d) show S as a function of\nu2 for different values of n/V and Lc/lp. As the chain number\ndensity increases, the phase transition occurs at a lower value of\nu2. Note that u2 appears as a product with n/V in Eq.6, so the\nthree curves in Fig.1(c) will be identical if ˜u2 = u2n/V is used as\nthe horizontal axis. As the chains become stiffer, Fig.1(d) shows\nthat the phase transition occurs at a lower value of u2, which is\nconsistent with the result in Ref.6.\n4\nIsotropic-Nematic Interface\nWe study an inhomogeneous configuration with coexisting\nisotropic and nematic regions, separated by a planar interface.\nUnlike the case of Sec.\n3 in which the density φ(r) is fixed\nand uniform in space, the density here is a function of position,\nand changes across the isotropic-nematic interface.\nAt coexis-\ntence, in addition to uniform temperature, the chemical poten-\ntial µ = (∂F/∂n)|V and pressure p = −(∂F/∂V)|n need to be the\nsame in both phases. In addition, there is an equilibrium con-\ndition associated with free energy minimization with respect to\nthe nematic order parameter. Far from the interface, the nematic\nphase is assumed uniaxial. Since the order parameter S is uncon-\nstrainable, at coexistence one simply has (∂F/∂S)|n,V = 0 in both\nbulk regions. The equilibrium configuration that contains an in-\nterface is obtained as follows: An initial configuration is set up in\nwhich Q and φ are fields varying only in the ˆx direction. To model\nan isotropic-nematic interface, a step function is introduced for S,\nwhere S = 0 on the left side, representing the isotropic phase, and\nS ̸= 0 on the right side, representing the nematic phase. The initial\nvalue of φ0\n0 = 1/\n√\n4π and P = 0 are chosen for a uniform density\nconfiguration with zero biaxiality. For an arbitrary director di-\nrection ˆn in the nematic region, Eqs. (13)(14)(15) are used to\ncompute the initial values of wm\nl . Equations (6) are iterated over\na system of length Lx = 10Lc with Neumann boundary conditions\napplied on both ends. The domain [0,10] is uniformly divided into\n400 intervals. The iteration process is terminated when the max-\n4 |\n1–10\n\n\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFig. 2 Isotropic-Nematic interface for different values of u2 and u0 in (a)(c) density profiles and (b)(d) uniaxial order profiles\nimum errors in wm\nl falls below ε = 10−4. The iteration converges\nslowly if the initial interface is positioned arbitrarily. To acceler-\nate convergence, the interface location is manually adjusted until\nthe error rapidly decreases to 10−4. Although the initial condition\nassumes a uniform density configuration, a density gap between\nthe isotropic and nematic regions naturally develops during the\niteration process for a finite value of u0. Furthermore, our re-\nsults reveal the emergence of nonzero biaxiality across the inter-\nface under planar alignment, even though the initial condition\nassumes P = 0. The nonzero biaxiality is not exclusive to planar\nalignment but is observed for any alignment where the director is\nnot perpendicular to the interface4.\nFirst, we study the interface with homeotropic alignment,\nwhere the director ˆn = ˆx. Density profiles are plotted in Fig.2(a)\nfor u2 = 9.88, 10 and 10.2. The local density of the isotropic region\nφI is lower than that of the nematic region, φN, leading to a den-\nsity gap between the nematic and isotropic regions. This result is\nconsistent with previous studies4? ? . In the canonical ensemble,\nwith fixed average chain number density n/V, there exists a range\nof u2 values for which the isotropic and nematic phases coexist.\nThe relative volume fraction of the nematic and isotropic regions\ndepends on the value of u2. For higher values of u2, the nematic\nregion becomes larger but exhibits a lower density, as shown in\nFig. 2(a). The shift in the interface position is also reflected in\nthe uniaxial order profile, as depicted in Fig. 2(b). In order to ex-\ntract the width (wi) and location of the interface from our SCFT\nsolutions, we approximate the interfacial uniaxial order profiles\nby26\nS(x) = SN\n2 [tanh(x−x0\nwi\n)+1]\n(17)\nwhere x0 denotes the center of the interface, and SN represents\nthe uniaxial order in the nematic region. The interfacial widths\nfrom the density profiles can be extracted in a similar way. We\nfind that x0 from the density profiles is larger than that from the S\nprofiles, indicating that the density jump is displaced towards the\nnematic side4. Additionally, the interfacial width extracted from\nthe density profiles are smaller than that from the S profiles.\nWe next address how the fluid compressibility, determined by\nthe value of the excluded volume coefficient u0, affects the inter-\nface. By setting u2 = 9.88, the interfaces for different values of\nu0 are shown in Fig.2(c)(d). As u0 increases, the system becomes\nmore incompressible, leading to a reduction in the gaps of both\nthe uniaxial order and the density profiles. The reduction of SN\nwidens the interface because segregation between nematic and\nisotropic phases is smaller? . In the limit of infinite u0 (a com-\npletely incompressible fluid), the density gaps vanishes, resulting\nin a uniform density throughout the space, and the interface lo-\ncation is arbitrary.\nInterfacial profiles depend on the director angle in the nematic\nregion relative to the interface normal.\nThe results for planar\nalignment ˆn = ˆz are shown in Fig. 3. Unlike the homeotropic\nalignment case just described, planar alignment is accompanied\n1–10 | 5\n\n\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 3 Interface for planar alignment.

(b) shows the three diagonal components\nof the tensor order parameter as functions of x\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 4 Interface width dependence on flexibility. For different values of ratio L/lp, the value of u2 is chosen to establish a stable interface near x = 5\n(u2 = 16.1 for Lc/lp = 2, u2 = 9.88 for Lc/lp = 1, u2 = 7.02 for Lc/lp = 0.5 and u2 = 4.58 for Lc/lp = 0.01). (a) shows the widths extracted from both\nthe φ and S profiles as a function of Lc/lp for homeotropic and planar alignments. (b) shows the ratio of widths between homeotropic alignment and\nplanar alignment as a function Lc/lp\nby nonzero biaxiality near the interface. Near the interface, but\non the isotropic side, the component of the tensor order parame-\nter Qxx is negative, and Qyy ≈Qzz > 0. This is in agreement with\npredictions from the Landau-de Gennes free energy26.\nThe interfacial width depends on the values of the elastic con-\nstants, which, in this model, depends on the flexibility of the\nchain. Here, we consider systems that are close to the incom-\npressible limit by setting u0 = 50. Interfacial widths as a function\nof chain flexibility Lc/lp are shown in Fig.4(a). Both widths ex-\ntracted from φ and S profiles decrease as the chains become more\nflexible. In the rigid chain limit (lp ≫Lc), the interface width is\non order of Lc. However, when the chains become flexible, the\nwidth scales with lp instead.\nIn semiflexible polymer chains, K1 is the same order as K3,\nwhereas K2 can be one order of magnitude smaller than both\ndepending on the flexibility17.\nWhen K1 ≈K3, the ratio of\nhomeotropic to planar width is predicted to be\nwh\nwp =\nq\n6+4κ\n6+κ ,\nwith κ = 2(K1/K2 −1) being a measure of the anisotropy26. In\nagreement with existing phenomenology, the interfacial width in\nthe case of homeotropic alignment is larger than that of planar\nalignment4. The ratio wh/wp as a function of Lc/lp is shown in\nFig.4(b); wh/wp increases as the chains become very flexible, in-\ndicating a higher elastic anisotropy κ.\n5\nTopological Defects in Two Dimensions\nWe focus here on a different type of non uniform configuration,\na topological defect in a two-dimensional square region of lateral\ndimensions Lx = Ly = 10. The region is discretized into 200×200\nuniform square domains. Unless stated otherwise, we set u0 = 15,\nu2 = 15, Lc = lp = 1, and n/V = 1. For the analysis below, we also\ndefine polar coordinates (r,ϕ) relative to the center of the defect.\nThe defect center is defined as the location where S = P, and it\nis determined as part of the free energy minimization. Initially,\nthe disclination center is positioned at the geometric center of\nthe square region. The initial configuration is specified as S(r) =\nSN[1 −exp(−5r)], P(r) = 0, and the director angle θ = qϕ, where\nq = ±1/2 is considered in this work. To obtain the SCFT solution,\nthe iteration process terminates once the maximum error in the\n6 |\n1–10\n\n\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\nFig. 5 SCFT solutions of ±1/2 defects.

Right: density\nfield.\nwm\nl field falls below ε = 0.01.\nFigure 5 presents the SCFT solutions for q = ±1/2 defects. The\ndirector profiles are shown in Figures 5(a) and 5(d) for q = −1/2\nand q = 1/2, respectively. Figures 5(b) and 5(e) illustrate the cor-\nresponding uniaxial (S) and biaxial (P) order parameters along\nthe line y = 0. For q = −1/2, the defect core remains at the ge-\nometric center. In contrast, for q = 1/2, the defect center shifts\ntoward the −ˆx direction as the iterations progress. In both cases,\nthe configurations are uniaxial (P = 0) far from the defect core.\nHowever, as the defect core is approached, P increases, leading\nto a locally biaxial configuration. At the exact center of the de-\nfect, where S = P, the tensor Q exhibits two degenerate positive\neigenvalues, resulting in a uniaxial configuration once again27,28.\nFigures 5(c) (f) show the anisotropic density distributions near\nthe defect cores. In both cases, the core regions exhibit lower\ndensities compared to the surrounding nematic regions. Figures\n6(a) (d) present the distributions of optical retardance, Γ = S−P,\na quantity that can be experimentally measured through polar-\nization microscopy. The Γ distributions reveal cores of smaller\nextent compared to what would be inferred from the density dis-\ntributions. Figures 6(b)(e) display the density and optical retar-\ndance along the line y = 0. The density profiles are smooth across\nthe cores, while Γ exhibits singular behavior at the cores. It is\nnoteworthy that, in the case of q = −1/2, the location of low-\nest density coincides with the defect core center. However, for\nq = 1/2, the location of the lowest density does not align with the\ndefect core center. The Γ distributions are further analyzed by\ntheir angular Fourier modes Γ(r,ϕ) = ∑Γn(r)cos(nϕ), as shown in\nFig.6(c) (f). The nonzero anisotropic term Γ1 in 1/2 defect and\nΓ3 in −1/2 defect are signatures of the anisotropy in splay and\nbend constants20,21.\nWe finally examine the dependence of the core structure on the\ninteraction coefficients u0 and u2, as well as on chain flexibility.\nFigure 7 presents the density profiles (top) and optical retardance\n(bottom) along y = 0 for a q = −1/2 defect under varying param-\neters. For each plot, all parameters are held constant(u0 = 15,\nu2 = 15, Lc = 1, lp = 1, and n/V = 1), except for the specific param-\neter being examined. We observe that the compressibility param-\neter u0 does not affect nematic order (SN) in the nematic region.\nThe core radius decreases as the system become less compressible\nand reaches a plateau in the incompressible limit. However, SN\nshows an increase with u2 and lp, as expected from the bulk state\nstudy. The density difference between the defect core and the ne-\nmatic regions decreases as the system becomes less compressible\n(i.e., with increasing u0). Increases in u2 or lp lead to greater\norder (SN) in the nematic region and an increased density differ-\nence between the defect core and the nematic regions. However,\nwhile an increase in u2 expands the region of density variation,\nthe size of density variation region remains relatively unchanged\nwhen lp is increased. To quantitatively analyze the size of the\ncore from the Γ configurations, we replotted Figures 7(e) and\n7(f) in Figures 8(a) and 8(b) by normalizing the data using the\noptical retardance in the nematic region (ΓN) and a characteris-\ntic length ξ, defined such that Γ(x = −ξ,y = 0) = ΓN/2. It allows\nξ to be displayed as a function of u2 and lp, as shown in Figures\n8(d) and 8(e). The characteristic length ξ decreases with increas-\n1–10 | 7\n\n\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\nFig. 6 SCFT solutions for ±1/2 defects. Top: (a), (b), and (c) correspond to a -1/2 defect.

The point for\nu2 = 24,u0 = 15 appears anomalous due to its coupling to a wide\ndensity variation.

The density and optical retardance pro-\nfiles along the line y = 0 are shown in 8(c)(f).

For homogeneous states, the\nphase transition follows by numerical minimization of the free\nenergy functional, revealing the effects of chain number density\nand flexibility on the transition. Larger density or stiffer chains\nare associated with lower Maier-Saupe interaction strength at the\ntransition point. In the case of an isotropic-nematic interface, we\nhave studied the effects of compressibility, interaction strength u2,\nand chain flexibility on the interface. A larger value of u0 corre-\nsponds to a smaller compressibility, leading to a smaller density\ngap between the two phases. In the canonical ensemble, the value\nof u2 determines the relative portion of the system occupied by\nthe isotropic and nematic phases. The interfacial width increases\nas the chain become stiffer, as given by larger persistence length\nlp. Both homeotropic and planar alignments have been studied.\nIn contrast to homeotropic alignment, planar alignment displays\nnonzero biaxiality across the interface and a smaller interfacial\nwidth. We have also studied the equilibrium configurations as-\nsociated with ±1/2 disclinations in a thin film geometry (two di-\nmensional variations of the nematic order parameter, but allow-\ning out of plane director orienation). Defects display a region of\nbiaxial order in the core region, and a uniaxial center defined as\nthe point in which S = P, the uniaxial and biaxial order parame-\nters coincide. Elastic anisotropy, which is naturally incorporated\nin the flexible chain model, leads to an anisotropic core in agree-\nment with previous experiments and computation. Finally, we\nhave examined the dependence of the core structure and extent\non the interaction coefficients u0 and u2, as well as on chain flexi-\nbility. For fixed far field nematic order SN, the core size is seen to\nincrease with lp, and hence to effectively decrease with increasing\ntwist/bend elastic anisotropy.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts of interest to declare.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research has been supported by the National Science Foun-\ndation under contract DMR-2223707, by the Minnesota Super-\ncomputing Institute of the University of Minnesota, and by the\nAdvanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services\n& Support (ACCESS) program, which is supported by U.S. Na-\ntional Science Foundation grants 2138259, 2138286, 2138307,\n2137603, and 2138296.\nNotes and references\n1 G.

To amortize the memory consumption across\nmultiple devices in long-context training, inter-data parti-\ntioning (a.k.a. Data Parallelism) and intra-data partitioning\n(a.k.a. Context Parallelism) are commonly used. Current\ntraining frameworks predominantly treat the two techniques\nas orthogonal, and establish static communication groups\nto organize the devices as a static mesh (e.g., a 2D mesh).\nHowever, the sequences for LLM training typically vary in\nlengths, no matter for texts, multi-modalities or reinforce-\nment learning. The mismatch between data heterogeneity\nand static mesh causes redundant communication and im-\nbalanced computation, degrading the training efficiency.\nIn this work, we introduce ByteScale, an efficient, flexible,\nand scalable LLM training framework for large-scale mixed\ntraining of long and short sequences. The core of ByteScale\nis a novel parallelism strategy, namely Hybrid Data Paral-\nlelism (HDP), which unifies the inter- and intra-data parti-\ntioning with a dynamic mesh design. In particular, we build\na communication optimizer, which eliminates the redundant\ncommunication for short sequences by data-aware shard-\ning and dynamic communication, and further compresses\nthe communication cost for long sequences by selective of-\nfloading. Besides, we also develop a balance scheduler to\nmitigate the imbalanced computation by parallelism-aware\ndata assignment. We evaluate ByteScale with the model\nsizes ranging from 7B to 141B, context lengths from 256K to\n2048K, on a production cluster with more than 12,000 GPUs.\nExperiment results show that ByteScale outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art training system by up to 7.89×.\n1\nIntroduction\nIn recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved\nremarkable success across various domains. The impressive\n∗Equal Contribution.\n†Corresponding Authors.\nperformance of LLMs is attributed to increased model sizes,\nlarger volumes of training data, and longer context windows,\nall in accordance with the scaling law [20]. The demand\nfor long-context capabilities of LLMs has increased rapidly,\nas modern LLM applications like documents summariza-\ntion [19], video understanding [41, 42], agent interaction [1]\nand code completion [27], require the model to understand\nlong-range dependencies. It has driven many organizations\nto extend their models’ context lengths. For instance, Meta’s\nLLaMA3 [11] and OpenAI’s GPT-4o [33] support 128K con-\ntexts, Anthropic’s Claude3 [3] supports 200K, and Google’s\nGemini-1.5 Pro [13] supports up to 2M contexts.\nA fundamental challenge in scaling to a long context is\nthe quadratic scaling of memory and computation for self-\nattention. Flash Attention [7, 8] has been proposed to reduce\nthe memory complexity from 𝑂(𝑆2) to 𝑂(𝑆), where 𝑆is the\nsequence length. To further scale the context length, it’s\nnecessary to partition the sequences across multiple devices.\nThere are broadly two categories: inter-data partitioning\n(a.k.a. Data Parallelism, DP [9, 24, 37]) distributes different\nsequences across the devices, while intra-data partitioning\n(a.k.a. Context Parallelism, CP [4, 23, 25, 31]) scatter a sin-\ngle sequence. Both categories evenly reduce the memory\nconsumption on each device, while inevitably incurring ex-\ntra communication overhead. Existing LLM training frame-\nworks, such as Megatron-LM [21, 30, 38], DeepSpeed [17, 36]\nand MegaScale [18], treat the two categories as individual\nparallelism strategies, and establish DP×CP communication\ngroups to organize the devices as a static mesh (e.g., a 2D\nmesh), where the size of each CP group is dependent on the\nmaximum sequence length (i.e., context length). Undoubt-\nedly, it requires the sequences to be of the same length so\nthat the training workloads across devices are uniform.\nNevertheless, the sequences for LLM training usually vary\nin lengths. For one thing, sequence lengths typically exhibit\nskewed distribution in real-world datasets, no matter the text\narXiv:2502.21231v1  [cs.DC]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\nor multi-modal data. For another thing, inference-time scal-\ning (e.g. OpenAI’s o1 [34], DeepSeek-R1 [10]) increases the\nlength of the Chain-of-Thought reasoning process, further\nexacerbates length heterogeneity for reinforcement learning.\nWhen facing the sequences with variable lengths, existing\nframeworks can only configure the size of CP groups to be\nlarge enough to handle the longest sequences (yielding a\nsmall DP size), and each sample needs to be evenly parti-\ntioned across the entire CP group, regardless of sequence\nlength, degrading the overall training efficiency.\nIn particular, the mismatch between data heterogeneity\nand static system design causes two main challenges (de-\ntailed in §3). 1○Redundant Communication: It is common\npractice to pack [22] shorter sequences into a single one up\nto the context length and configure a sufficient CP size to\nprevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors. However, all short se-\nquences have to undergo the same partitioning and commu-\nnication process as long sequences, even if it is unnecessary.\nWorse yet, CP requires 𝑂(𝑆2) computation to overlap 𝑂(𝑆)\ncommunication, which is challenging for short sequences.\n2○Imbalanced Computation: Although tokens are evenly\npartitioned across devices by CP and memory is balanced,\nexecution times still vary. This is because the computational\ncomplexity of each token is related to the original sequence\nlength, which is 𝑂(𝑆2). The imbalanced computation causes\nsome devices to fall into idle time for synchronization.\nSummary of Contributions. To address the aforemen-\ntioned challenges, we propose ByteScale, an efficient, flexi-\nble, and scalable training framework designed for large-scale\nmixed training of long and short sequences. The main con-\ntributions are as follows:\nC1: Proposal of Hybrid Data Parallelism. We propose\na novel parallelism strategy, namely Hybrid Data Parallelism\n(HDP), which unifies both inter-data (DP) and intra-data\npartitioning (CP), and is defined to evenly distributing tokens\nacross devices. It utilizes devices in the range of [1, DP×CP]\nto flexibly process variable-length sequences.\nC2: Communication Optimizations. To eliminate re-\ndundant communication for short sequences, HDP provides\nthe ability of data-aware sharding, where dynamic communi-\ncation groups are automatically built and each sequence will\nbe processed with a minimal number of devices individually.\nBesides, HDP also provides selective offloading to further\ncompress the communication cost for long sequences.\nC3: Balance Strategy. To mitigate the imbalanced compu-\ntation, we design a heuristic algorithm that reorganizes data\nassignment based on the characteristics of data and pipeline\nparallelism. Furthermore, for those devices with shorter exe-\ncution times, we assign more micro batches, rather than the\nsame number under the static system design.\nC4: Evaluation. We conduct experiments on a production\ncluster with more than 12,000 GPUs, scaling the model size\nfrom 7B to 141B, and context length from 256K to 2048K.

Sequence Padding and Packing\nresults demonstrate that ByteScale achieves up to 7.89× of\nspeedup compared to existing training approaches.\n2\nBackground\n2.1\nTransformers and Large Language Models\nThe transformer architecture [40] has become the most pop-\nular and widely used foundational architecture for large\nlanguage models (LLMs) [5, 14, 32, 39] nowadays. It typically\nconsists of a series of transformer layers, each comprising an\nattention module and a feed-forward network (FFN) module.\nAs shown in Figure 1, self-attention captures contextual in-\nformation throughout the entire text, necessitating all tokens\nin the full sequence to participate in computation. In con-\ntrast, other operations like normalization, linear projection,\nand activation functions perform token-wise computations,\nallowing each token to be processed independently.\n2.2\nDistributed LLM Training\nAs model sizes and training data continue to scale, distributed\ntraining techniques are indispensable in LLM training.\nData Parallelism. Data parallelism (DP) [9, 24, 37] dis-\ntributes the training data evenly across devices, while each\ndevice holds a replica of the model. During each training step,\ndevices process their local data individually, and synchro-\nnize gradients globally to update the model. ZeRO series [35]\nmethods further enhance the scalability of DP.\nModel Parallelism. Model parallelism distributes the\nmodel across devices, including tensor parallelism (TP) [38]\nand pipeline parallelism (PP) [16, 28, 29]. TP performs intra-\noperation partitioning, dividing operations and parameters\nwithin a layer across devices (e.g. Row- and Col-Parallel\nLinear in Megatron-LM [38]). It requires communication\nof intermediate results (activations), and is typically used\nwithin a single node. PP employs inter-operation partition-\ning, segmenting the model layers into different stages. It\nrequires only the exchange of activations between consecu-\ntive stages via peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, enabling\nmodel partitioning across multiple nodes.\n2\n\n\n(a) data & context parallelism\nmb#0 mb#1\ncp = 2\ncp = 2\nmb#0 mb#1\n½ \n½ \n½ \n½ \n½ \n½ \n½ \n½ \n½ \n½ \n½ \n½ \n½ \n½ \nDP0\nDP1\nrank0\nrank1\nrank2\nrank3\nmb#0\nmb#1\nbubble\ntime\nmb#0 mb#1\ngrad sync\nmb#0\nmb#1\nmb#0 mb#1\ngrad sync\nbubble\nDP1\ncp = 2\nmb#0 mb#1\n½ \n½ \n½ \n½ \n½ \n½ \n½ \n½ \np2p \ncomm\nmb#0 mb#1\ndp = 2\nno \ncomm\nrank2\nrank3\nrank0\nrank2\nDP0\n(b) redundant communication\n(c) imbalance computation\nFigure 3.

Sample and Token Distribution in two Datasets\nHybrid Parallelism. Hybrid parallelism combines var-\nious parallel strategies to enhance training efficiency. Par-\nticularly, Megatron-LM employs the 3D parallelism strat-\negy [21, 30, 38] by integrating DP, TP, and PP, making it a\nmainstream approach for large-scale model training today.\nGradient Accumulation. To improve the efficiency and\nconvergence, LLMs typically require large batch size [6, 15,\n39] (e.g. it is common practice to apply nearly 30~80M tokens\nper batch for LLM training in the cluster with 10K GPUs).\nConstrained by hardware memory, processing the entire\nlarge batch at once is infeasible. Gradient accumulation di-\nvides each global batch (i.e., the sampled data in each training\nstep) into multiple micro-batches. The gradients from these\nmicro-batches are accumulated to equal the gradient as if\nthe entire global batch were processed in a single pass.\n2.3\nPadding and Packing\nTo support variable-length sequences in current static par-\nallelism strategies, techniques such as padding and packing\nare necessary. As illustrated in Figure 2, padding pads the\nsequences in the same batch to be of the same length, but\ncauses wasted computation. Packing [22] concatenates mul-\ntiple sequences into a single one without padded tokens. It\nemploys a special segmented attention mask to ensure that\neach sequence is processed independently by self-attention.\n2.4\nLong Context Training\nAs self-attention exhibits both time and memory complex-\nity of 𝑂(𝑆2), when the context length scales, this quadratic\ncomplexity becomes a bottleneck. Flash Attention [7, 8]\noptimizes memory I/O and employs the tiling technique\nto reduce memory complexity from 𝑂(𝑆2) to 𝑂(𝑆), while\nstill maintaining 𝑂(𝑆2) time complexity. Context Parallelism\n(CP) [4, 23, 25, 31] further partitions the sequence across 𝑁\ndevices, reducing the memory from𝑂(𝑆) to𝑂( 𝑆\n𝑁). Following\nFigure 1, CP shards QKV along the sequence dimension, and\ncross-tokens operations require KV slices to be exchanged\nacross devices using a ring-style P2P communication, which\noverlaps with computation. This technique is also applicable\nto packed sequences, and we will detail its implementation\nin §7. Notably, each subsequence must also be sharded across\nall CP ranks, as illustrated in Figure 2(c) and 3(a).\n3\nObervation & Motivation\n3.1\nData Heterogeneity\nLLMs are trained on sequences data. As mentioned in §1, the\ntraining data typically consists of variable-length sequences.\nThere exist two observations and one significant challenge:\nObservation 1: sequence lengths exhibit skewed distri-\nbution in real-world datasets. As shown in Figure 4, we\nprofiled the sample and token distribution of two datasets: an\nopen-source dataset GitHub and a productive dataset Byted\nfor long-context training. We observed that both of them ex-\nhibit a skewed distribution in sequence lengths. For instance,\nin the Byted dataset, if we randomly sample a global batch,\nnearly 80% of the samples are 4K tokens or shorter, while\nonly 0.05% of the samples can reach 2M tokens. However,\nfrom the perspective of token distribution, those 0.05% of the\nsamples (>=2M) contribute 12.1% of the tokens in the global\nbatch, and 1% of the samples (>=128K) contribute 44.3%. Al-\nthough the GitHub dataset has a lower proportion of long\nsequences, 16.2% of its tokens come from sequences exceed-\ning 128K, demonstrating significant data heterogeneity.\nObservation 2: mixing long and short sequences en-\nhances model performance. The existing work [12] has\ndemonstrated that training exclusively on long-context data\ncan lead to a decline in short-context performance. LLaMA3\nreport [11] indicates that when training a model with 128K\ncontext, mixing 0.1% of long data with the original short data\noptimizes the performance across both short-context and\nlong-context benchmarks. DeepSeek-R1 [10] presents the\naverage response length on the training set during the RL\nprocess, demonstrating that gradually increasing and diverse\nresponse lengths help improve model performance.\n3\n\n\n1 2\n0\n0\n3\n0\n1 2\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n2\n2\n2\n2\n4\n5\n6\n3\n3\n3\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n4\n4\n4\n4\n5\n6\n7\n5\n5\n5\n5\n6\n7\n6\n6\n6\n6\n7\n7\n7\n7\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2 3\n1\n2\n1\n1\n2\n3\n4\n1\n3\n4\n5\n2\n33\npp bubble\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n4\n5\n6\n3\n3\n3\n4\n5\n6\n4\n4\n4\n4\n5\n6\n5\n5\n5\n5\n6 6\n6\n6\n6\n7\n7\n7\n7\n7\n7\n7\n7\npp bubble\n3\n7\npp bubble\ngrad sync & \nmodel update\nsync\nwait\npp bubble\ndp bubble\npipeline (b)\npipeline (a)\n0\nFigure 5.

Imbalanced Computation\nChallenge: data heterogeneity leads to efficiency degra-\ndation. Although mixed training of long and short sequences\nis common and beneficial for model performance, it intro-\nduces new challenges. The static parallelism strategies used\nin existing systems are not well-suited to handle dynamic\nworkloads. This causes issues of redundant communication\n(§3.2) and imbalanced computation (§3.3), which we will\ndiscuss in more detail below.\n3.2\nRedundant Communication\nExisting systems apply static parallelism strategies through-\nout the training process. Typically, they assume that all\n(packed) sequences are of the same length and set a fixed\nCP degree to amortize them across enough devices, thereby\navoiding OOM errors. As mentioned in §2.3, to handle variable-\nlength sequences, it is common to pack sequences up to the\ncontext length. However, as depicted in Figure 3(a)-(b), all\nsequences have to be partitioned across the entire CP group,\neven if it is unnecessary for shorter ones.\nFor instance, assuming that each device has a capacity\nof 8K tokens, to train an LLM with a context length of 1M\ntokens, a CP degree of 128 is required. This configuration ne-\ncessitates 128 individual devices to process a sequence of 1M\ntokens. Concurrently, a large number of shorter sequences,\nsuch as those with lengths of 4K, 8K, and 16K tokens, are\npacked up to 1M tokens and processed in a CP group with 128\ndevices. As depicted in Figure 14, each subsequence within\nthe packed sequence needs to be partitioned into 128 chunks\nacross CP ranks, performing ring-P2P communication. In\nfact, it is unnecessary to perform cross-device partitioning\nand communication for sequences with lengths under 8K.\nFor those sequences with 16K tokens, only two CP ranks are\n§5.

Using the same CP degree as for the maximum se-\nquence length leads to excessive redundant communication\nfor these shorter sequences. This issue is exacerbated when\nsequence lengths are highly skewed.\n3.3\nImbalanced Computation\nImbalanced FLOPs. Although Flash Attention enables lin-\near packing with 𝑂(𝑆) memory complexity, the computa-\ntional complexity for each subsequence remains 𝑂(𝑆2). As\ndepicted in Figures 2(d) and 3(c), even if two packed se-\nquences contain the same number of tokens, their actual\ncomputational workloads differ, which are proportional to\nthe areas of attention mask. As shown in Figure 6(a), when\nthe context length is shorter than 8K tokens, the 𝑂(𝑆2) term\nis relatively insignificant, allowing packing to effectively bal-\nance workloads for both memory and computation. However,\nfor long-context training tasks, the 𝑂(𝑆2) term becomes the\npredominant component of the computation, leading to sig-\nnificant time imbalances across different packed sequences.\nTo provide an intuitive explanation, we sampled a global\nbatch of 1.2M tokens from the GitHub dataset and randomly\npacked them into micro-batches of up to 32K tokens, aligning\nwith the model’s context length. As shown in Figure 6(b),\nwe recorded the FLOPs (Floating Point Operations) for each\nmicro-batch and observed significant variability, indicating\nthat the execution time for each micro-batch also differs.\nImbalanced Data and Pipeline Parallelism. The imbal-\nanced execution times across micro-batches further degrade\n4\n\n\nQKV\nK0 V0\nO00\nK1 V1\nO01\nK2 V2\nO02\nK3 V3\nO03\nO0\n…\n…\nQKV\nO1\nQKV\nO2\nQKV\nO3\nQ0\nK0 V0\nO10\nK1 V1\nO11\nK2 V2\nO12\nK3 V3\nO13\nQ1\nK0 V0\nO20\nK1 V1\nO21\nK2 V2\nO22\nK3 V3\nO23\nQ2\nK0 V0\nO30\nK1 V1\nO31\nK2 V2\nO32\nK3 V3\nO33\nQ3\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\nQKV\nK0 V0\nO00\nK1 V1\nO01\nO0\n…\n…\nQ0\nQKV\nK0 V0\nO10\nK1 V1\nO11\nO1\n…\n…\nQ1\nQKV\nK0 V0\nO00\nK1 V1\nO01\nO0\n…\n…\nQ0\nQKV\nK0 V0\nO10\nK1 V1\nO11\nO1\n…\n…\nQ1\nQKV\nK0 V0\nO00\nK1 V1\nO01\nO0\n…\n…\nQ0\nQKV\nK0 V0\nO10\nK1 V1\nO11\nO1\n…\n…\nQ1\nQKV\nK V\nO\n…\n…\nQ\nQKV\nK V\nO\n…\n…\nQ\ngrad \nacc\n(a) optimizer \nstates\ngrad \nacc\ngrad acc \n& update\n(b) case1: comm_groups = 1, \nsize = (4)\n(c) case2: comm_groups = 2, \nsize = (2, 2)\n(d) case3: comm_groups = 3, \nsize = (1, 2, 1)\nMB#0\nMB#1\nMB#2\nS0\nS1\nS2\nS3\nS4\nS5\nrank0\nrank1\nrank2\nrank3\nFigure 8. Illustration of HDP\nthe efficiency of data and pipeline parallelism. In data par-\nallelism, all DP ranks must execute the same number of\nmicro-batches, and then synchronize gradients before the\nmodel update. As illustrated in Figure 3(c), rank-2 processes\ntokens with fewer FLOPs than rank-0, leading to idle time\n(i.e. DP Bubble) as it waits for synchronization. In pipeline\nparallelism, there are two types of “bubbles”: the PP bubble\noccurs within a single pipeline, and the DP bubble occurs\nacross different pipelines (different DP groups). Aside from\nPP bubbles during the warmup and cooldown phases, imbal-\nanced FLOPs between micro-batches prevent the execution\ntime on different devices from overlapping as they would in\nan ideal pipeline. This leads to extra PP bubbles caused by\ninter-stage waiting, as shown in Figure 5. Additionally, since\neach micro-batch is executed sequentially across 𝑑pp differ-\nent stages in the pipeline, any DP bubble will be magnified\nby a factor of 𝑑pp. For example, consider two pipelines illus-\ntrated in Figure 5, the micro-batches 0 and 7 in the pipeline\n(a) have a longer forward and backward execution time com-\npared to those in the pipeline (b). Under 𝑑pp = 4, this time\ngap is magnified fourfold. Consequently, after executing 8\nmicro-batches, the pipeline (b) falls into a prolonged idle\nperiod, waiting for gradient synchronization. This causes\nthe DP bubble to account for over 30% of the total execution\ntime, far exceeding the normal pipeline bubble time.\n4\nByteScale Overview\nWe present ByteScale to address these challenges. As shown\nin Figure 7, it consists of three main components. Profiler\nis to profile the environment, model configuration, data\ndistribution, and build cost models for other components.\nCommunication Optimizer is to improve the communication\nefficiency for both short and long sequences by data-aware\nsharding, dynamic communication, and selective offloading.\nBalance Scheduler is to solve the imbalanced computation\nby parallelism-aware data assignment.\n5\nCommunication Optimizer\nThis section describes how ByteScale optimizes communi-\ncation overhead. First, it reduces redundant communication\nfor short sequences by dynamic sequence sharding and com-\nmunication. Second, it further compresses the communica-\ntion cost for long sequences by selective offloading.\n5.1\nData-Aware Sharding and Communication\nHybrid Data Parallelism. To begin with, we introduce a\nnovel parallelism strategy, namely Hybrid Data Parallelism\n(HDP), to enable efficient training for different levels of se-\nquence lengths. Both DP and CP partition training data\nacross devices. DP performs inter-data partitioning by dis-\ntributing different samples evenly across devices, while CP\nperforms intra-data partitioning by sharding a single sample\nacross devices. HDP unifies both inter-data and intra-data\npartitioning and is defined to evenly distribute tokens across\ndevices. It can replace traditional DP and CP, with the paral-\nlel degree of HDP equivalent to the product of the degrees\nof DP and CP (i.e. 𝑑hdp = 𝑑dp × 𝑑cp).\nUnlike DP and CP, which require all DP/CP ranks to per-\nform consistent behavior in computation or communication\n(e.g. CP requires all CP ranks to participate in homogeneous\nring-P2P communication), HDP allows for heterogeneous\nbehavior among HDP ranks. It has two key characteristics:\n1○More Flexible Communication: HDP only requires that\ndifferent HDP ranks handle an equal number of tokens.\nThis means that some HDP ranks may be assigned com-\nplete sequences (short sequences), as illustrated by 𝑆3 and\n𝑆5 in Figure 8(d), while some other ranks may only handle\nthe partial slice of a sequence (long sequences), as shown\nwith 𝑆4 in Figure 8(d). This necessitates establishing more\nflexible communication groups. For instance, in Figure 8(d),\na communication group of size 2 is created only between\nrank-[1~2] to compute the distributed attention for 𝑆4,\nwhile rank-0 and 3 can perform local computation without\ncross-device communication. In Figure 8(b), sequence 𝑆0\nis sharded into four slices, and a communication group of\nsize 4 is created among rank-[0~3].\n2○More Finer-Grained Communication: Static parallel\nstrategies require that the product of the parallel degrees\nequals the number of devices in the cluster, i.e. 𝑑dp × 𝑑cp ×\n𝑑tp × 𝑑pp = 𝑁cluster, where 𝑑tp and 𝑑pp are actually fixed\nbased on model size.

Per-Layer Activation Offloading\nthis divisibility, 𝑑dp and 𝑑cp can only be scaled by a limited\nfactor, resulting in coarse granularity (e.g. assume each\nrank can handle 8K tokens, 512K can use <𝑑dp = 2, 𝑑cp =\n64>, while 768K needs 𝑑cp = 96 but must use <𝑑dp = 1,\n𝑑cp = 128>). Meanwhile, HDP can use any amount of ranks\nin [1,𝑑hdp] to handle a sequence without considering the\ndivisibility constraints (e.g. with 𝑑hdp = 𝑑dp × 𝑑cp = 128,\nHDP can use 96 ranks to handle a 768K sequence while use\nrest 32 ranks to handle 32 × 8K sequences individually).\nNCCL Buffer Optimization. Creating NCCL communi-\ncation groups incurs extra overhead. Firstly, the process of\nestablishing a communication group is inherently slow, and\ndynamically creating new groups for each sequence can sig-\nnificantly reduce training efficiency. Secondly, creating an\nexcessive number of communication groups can consume an\nadditional 5~10GB of memory per GPU for NCCL buffers, fur-\nther reducing the available memory. Fortunately, distributed\nattention utilizes P2P communication. With a global com-\nmunication group across all HDP ranks, P2P communication\nbetween any two devices can directly reuse the existing\ngroup, thereby alleviating the time and memory pressure\nassociated with creating temporary communication groups.\nOptimizer States Sharding. HDP evenly partitions to-\nkens across devices, and will shard neither model param-\neters nor gradients. This means that HDP ranks replicate\nthe model states like DP. Consequently, the ZeRO series\ntechnique is also suitable to HDP, as shown in Figure 8(a),\nHDP utilizes ZeRO-1 across all the HDP ranks to maximally\nshards the optimizer states, minimizing the memory usage.\nLoss and Model Update. Even though HDP ranks may\nperform different heterogeneous communications across dif-\nferent micro-batches, the final gradient for a parameter is\nequivalent to that obtained in standard DP. As shown in\nFigure 9, each token contributes a gradient to the parameter\n𝜃𝑛, and the final gradient, denoted as 𝐺𝜃𝑛, is the sum over\npack hook\nforward graph\nbackward graph\nunpack hook\nparameter\nactivation\ngraph ctx\ntensor tag = {layer id, act id}\ncur layer \nactivations\npush\ngpu tensor\npop\nCPU\nMemory\nD2H\noffload\npush\nH2D\nreload\nprev layer \nactivations\npop\nparameter\nactivation\ntensor tag = {layer id, act id}\ngraph ctx\ngpu tensor\nDevices Mapping\noffload\nDevices Mapping\n(a) selective offloading\n(b) activation offloading\nFigure 11. Data-Aware Selective Offloading\ngradients from all tokens in global batch (denoted as B). Let\ngrad(𝑗,𝜃𝑛) represent the gradient from the token 𝑗to the\nparameter 𝜃𝑛. Then 𝐺𝜃𝑛can be presented as:\n𝐺𝜃𝑛=\n∑︁\n𝑆𝑖∈B\n\u0010∑︁\n𝑗∈𝑆𝑖grad(𝑗,𝜃𝑛)\n\u0011\n(1)\nSince parameters are replicated and tokens are evenly\ndistributed across HDP ranks (denoted as R), the local accu-\nmulated gradient corresponds to the partial sum of gradients\nfrom tokens assigned to each rank (denoted as B𝑟, i.e. micro-\nbatches in rank 𝑟). Consequently, similar to DP, a global\ncollective communication like All-Reduce or Reduce-Scatter\nwill be performed across all HDP ranks to aggregate partial\ngradients. This also yields the gradient 𝐺𝜃𝑛from all tokens:\n𝐺𝜃𝑛=\n∑︁\n𝑟∈R, B𝑟∈B\n\u0010∑︁\n𝑚∈B𝑟\n\u0010∑︁\n𝑗∈𝑚grad(𝑗,𝜃𝑛)\n\u0011\u0011\n(2)\nThe Eq.(2) is equivalent to Eq.(1), and ensures that the\nresult of gradient accumulation in HDP is equivalent to that\nin standard DP. Moreover, since we calculate the gradient\n𝐺𝜃𝑛over all tokens in the global batch, it also needs to be\nscaled by the total amount of tokens, as we implement this\nby the token-level loss, which scales the loss by the token\namount rather than sample amount.\n5.2\nData-Aware Selective Offloading\nActivation Offloading. The activation size is proportional\nto the sequence length. Constrained by GPU memory, longer\nsequences require more HDP ranks to distribute the activa-\ntion. For example, processing a sequence with 1M tokens re-\nquires 128 ranks if each rank can handle 8K tokens, which is\nusually unaffordable with today’s expensive GPU resources.\nIn practice, modern GPU servers are typically equipped with\nCPU memory that far exceeds GPU memory. Therefore, an\nalternative approach is to offload activations to the CPU,\nthereby reducing the required amount of ranks. There are\ntwo characteristics to support the feasibility of this approach:\n1○Activation is first-in-last-out: As shown in Figure 10,\ngiven any sequence, during the forward propagation, it will\n6\n\n\nbe processed sequentially by transformer layers, and acti-\nvations will be gradually accumulated until reaching a peak\nafter the final layer. Subsequently, during the backward\npropagation, these activations will be consumed from the\nlast layer to the first one. Since the activations produced by\nearlier layers are used more later (i.e. FILO), it is promising\nto offload these activations to the CPU during the forward\npropagation and reload them back into GPU when needed\nin the backward propagation.\n2○𝑂(𝑁2) computation can overlap 𝑂(𝑁) offloading: It is\nwell-known that transferring data between GPU and CPU\nis typically inefficient due to the limited PCIe bandwidth.\nThe offloading time usually far exceeds the computation\ntime, making it impractical. Fortunately, as mentioned in\n§2.4, the computational complexity of attention is 𝑂(𝑆2),\nwhile the memory complexity is 𝑂(𝑆). Therefore, for suffi-\nciently long sequences, the 𝑂(𝑆2) computation time will\ninevitably surpass the 𝑂(𝑆) data transfer time, allowing\nthe offloading to be perfectly masked under computation.\nAs illustrated in Figure 11(b), we designed a general com-\nponent named act_ctx (Listing 1) to support activation of-\nfloading. This component maintains two cuda streams for\nD2H (Device-to-Host) and H2D (Host-to-Device) separately.\nIt automatically captures activation tensors from the com-\nputation graph and offloads them to the CPU (use async-\nCudaMemcpy API) at appropriate times during the forward\npropagation, and establishes asynchronous dependencies\nbetween the D2H stream and the computation stream. The\noriginal tensor in the computation graph is replaced with the\nmetadata {layer id, act id}. Similarly, during the backward\npropagation, the metadata stored in the computation graph\nis used to index and reload corresponding activations in the\nH2D stream. Figure 10 illustrates the whole process. The\nact_ctx also supports a parameter named offload_ratio, pro-\nviding token-level fine-grained control over the proportion\nof activations offloaded to the CPU. This capability balances\nGPU memory savings with optimal overlap of computation.\n1\n# Separate offload_ratio to each micro -batch\n2\nact_ctx = get_act_ctx(num_micro_batch , offload_ratios)\n3\n# forward of micro -batch -i\n4\nact_ctx.update_micro_batch_id(i)\n5\nwith act_ctx:\n6\nforward_func (...)\n7\n# backward of micro -batch -j\n8\nact_ctx.update_micro_batch_id(j)\n9\nwith act_ctx:\n10\nbackward_func (...)\nListing 1. usage of act_ctx\nSelective Offloading. Activation offloading leverages CPU\nmemory to alleviate the burden on GPU memory. However,\nonly for long sequences the computation can perfectly over-\nlap with offloading. This means we cannot offload all tokens\nassigned to each rank indiscriminately. Instead, we must\nselectively offload each token based on the FLOPs.\nAlgorithm 1: Naive HDP Solution\n1 Input: Global Batch B={𝑠1,𝑠2, . . . ,𝑠𝑛}, Rank Capacity 𝐶\nfor each sequence 𝑠𝑖∈B do\n2\nDetermine offload ratio 𝑟and minimum required\nnumber of HDP ranks 𝐷(𝑠𝑖) using Eq.(3);\n3\nif 𝑑𝑖== 0 then\n4\nAdd 𝑠𝑖to 𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑘_𝑙𝑖𝑠𝑡;\n5\nelse\n6\nUpdate 𝑚𝑎𝑝𝑟[𝑠𝑖] ←𝑟and 𝑚𝑎𝑝𝑑[𝑠𝑖] ←𝐷(𝑠𝑖);\n7 while 𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑘_𝑙𝑖𝑠𝑡is not empty do\n8\nPack 𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑡by best-fit strategy to fill capacity 𝐶;\n9\nUpdate 𝑚𝑎𝑝𝑟[𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑡] ←0, 𝑚𝑎𝑝𝑑[𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑡] ←1;\n10 Assign sequences to 𝑑ℎ𝑑𝑝HDP ranks based on 𝑚𝑎𝑝𝑑;\n11 Initialize 𝑎𝑐𝑡_𝑐𝑡𝑥for each micro-batch using 𝑚𝑎𝑝𝑟;\n12 Return micro-batches, 𝑎𝑐𝑡_𝑐𝑡𝑥for each HDP rank\nAssume the number of layers per rank as 𝑙, the token\ncapacity per rank as 𝐶.

(3), where 𝛼1, 𝛽1, 𝛼2, 𝛽2 and 𝛾\nare coefficients we profiled for the cost model.\narg min\n𝑟\n𝐷(𝑠𝑖),\ns.t.\n𝑇(𝑠𝑖) = 𝛼1𝑠2\n𝑖+ 𝛽1𝑠𝑖+ 𝛾, Act(𝑠𝑖) = 𝛼2𝑠𝑖+ 𝛽2,\n𝐷(𝑠𝑖) = ⌈2 × Act(𝑠𝑖) + (1 −𝑟) × (𝑙−2) × Act(𝑠𝑖)\n𝑙× Act(𝐶)\n⌉,\n𝑇(𝑠𝑖) ≥\nAct(𝑠𝑖) × 𝑟\nmin(𝐵d2h, 𝐵h2d) ,\n1 ≥𝑟≥min(1,\n𝑙× Act(𝐶)\n(𝑙−2) × Act(𝑠𝑖) ).\n(3)\nSince different micro-batches have mutual independent\nforward and backward propagation, in Listing 1 we assign\na separate offload_ratio derived from Eq. (3) to each micro-\nbatch. This method effectively compresses the number of\nranks required for long sequences from 𝑠𝑖\n𝐶to 𝐷(𝑠𝑖), as shown\nin Figure 11(a). It not only significantly reduces communi-\ncation overhead but also enables the more available HDP\nranks to process data, thereby improving efficiency.\nOverlap Efficiency Discussion. As we know, the NCCL\ncommunication needs to occupy a portion of streaming mul-\ntiprocessors (SMs), to reach the peak bandwidth over Infini-\nBand and NVLink. Consequently, even with communication-\ncomputation overlap, the computation kernels cannot fully\nutilize all the tensor cores, resulting in inefficiencies. Fortu-\nnately, the D2H and H2D kernel use the DMA engine rather\nthan SMs, making it overlap perfectly with both computation\nand communication. Moreover, we use cached pinned host\n7\n\n\n6\n5\n3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n4\n1\n4\n1\n2\n3\n1\n5\n2\n2\n2\n2\n4\n5\n6\n3\n3\n3\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n4\n4\n4\n4\n5\n6\n7\n5\n5\n5\n6\n6\n7\n6\n6\n7\n7\n7\n7\n7\n6\n3\n5\n6\n5\n3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n4\n1\n4\n1\n2\n3\n1\n5\n2\n2\n2\n2\n4\n5\n6\n3\n3\n3\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n4\n4\n4\n4\n5\n6\n7\n5\n5\n5\n6\n6\n7\n6\n6\n7\n7\n7\n7\n7\n6\n3\n5\n6\n5\n3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n4\n1\n4\n1\n2\n3\n1\n5\n2\n2\n2\n2\n4\n5\n6\n3\n3\n3\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n4\n4\n4\n4\n5\n6\n7\n5\n5\n5\n6\n6\n7\n6\n6\n7\n7\n7\n7\n7\n6\n3\n5\npp bubble\npp bubble\ngrad sync & model update\npp bubble\n(a) Pipeline0: CP=1,2,3,4, micro batches=8\n6\n5\n3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n4\n1\n4\n1\n2\n3\n1\n5\n2\n2\n2\n2\n4\n5\n6\n3\n3\n3\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n4\n4\n4\n4\n5\n6\n7\n5\n5\n5\n6\n6\n7\n6\n6\n7\n7\n7\n7\n7\n6\n3\n5\n1 2\n1\n3\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n3\n3\n3\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n4\n4\n4\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n5\n5\n5\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n6\n6\n6\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n7\n7\n7\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n8\n8\n8\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n9\n9\n9\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n10\n10\n10\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n11\n11\n11\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n12\n12\n12\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n13\n13\n13\n13\n14\n15\n16\n14\n14\n14\n14\n15\n16\n15\n15\n15\n15\n16 16\n16\n16\n16\n17\n17\n17\n17 17\n17\n17\n17\npp bubble\nsync\nCP=3\n(b) Pipeline1: CP=1, micro batches=18\nCP=4\nCP=2\nFigure 12. Balanced Data and Pipeline Parallelism\nmemory to further reduce the overhead of CPU memory al-\nlocation and speed up the data exchange between the device\nand host. Since pipeline parallelism interleaves the forward\nand backward propagation of different micro-batches, the\nD2H and H2D kernels could execute simultaneously, thereby\nmaximizing the bidirectional bandwidth of PCIe.\n5.3\nOverall Routine\nThe overall routine of ByteScale is outlined in Alg. 1. Briefly\nspeaking, the algorithm traverses each sequence 𝑠𝑖in the\nglobal batch. For long sequences, it derives the offload ratio\n𝑟and determines the required number of ranks 𝐷(𝑠𝑖) (lines\n1-6). For short sequences, it packs them to fill each rank’s\ncapacity 𝐶(lines 7-9). The processed sequences are then\nassigned to 𝑑hdp ranks, and the algorithm returns the micro-\nbatches and 𝑎𝑐𝑡_𝑐𝑡𝑥, for execution (lines 10-12).\n6\nBalance Scheduler\nIn this section, we introduce the balance scheduler to ad-\ndress both the DP and PP imbalance issues. By carefully\norchestrating data assignment (instead of line 10 in Alg. 1),\nit mitigates these imbalances while keeping the minimum\ncommunication as §5 performs. We will first outline several\nkey insights and then propose our heuristic solution.\n6.1\nRedefine micro-batch\nGradient accumulation requires that different DP ranks exe-\ncute the same number of micro-batches, based on the assump-\ntion that all micro-batches have the same computational load.\nHowever, as mentioned in §3.3, execution times for different\nmicro-batches can significantly vary. In ByteScale, we re-\ndefine a more flexible strategy, which enables different HDP\nranks to process different numbers of micro-batches (same\nsize but differ in workloads), to mitigate the imbalance issue.\nAs shown in Figure 13, it makes all the ranks finish compu-\ntation at the same time. More importantly, this strategy does\nnot affect model convergence. Regardless of how sequences\nare assigned to HDP ranks, we finally calculate the sum of\ngradients from all tokens in the global batch, as discussed in\n§5.1, which ensures the mathematical equivalence.\ntimeline\n(a) DP Balance\nseq0\nseq1\nseq2\nseq3\nseq4\nseq5\npipeline stages\n(b) PP Balance\nseqlen\ntimeline\nseqlen\nFigure 13. Balance Strategy\n6.2\nSolve PP Imbalance\nInsight 1: PP bubbles are less when sequences of different length\nlevels are assigned to separate pipelines.\nIt is crucial to ensure that the pipeline processes micro-\nbatches with similar execution times. As illustrated in Fig-\nure 13(b), when 𝑑𝑝𝑝= 4, any 4 consecutive micro-batches on\nthe timeline will be executed by 4 PP stages at the same time.\nIf their execution times differ significantly, extra PP bubbles\noccur. Due to the limited number of long sequences in the\nglobal batch, some pipelines have to be assigned sequences\nof multiple length levels. Fortunately, only during transition\nphases (e.g., when 4 consecutive micro-batches belong to\ndifferent length levels) will cause extra PP bubbles.\nWe assign more micro-batches to those pipelines with less\naverage execution times. As illustrated in Figure 12(a)-(b),\npipeline-0 handles micro-batches with larger average exe-\ncution times and is therefore assigned only 8 micro-batches.\nIn contrast, pipeline-1 is assigned 18 micro-batches to syn-\nchronize with pipeline-0. Additionally, due to more micro-\nbatches, the bubble rate is further reduced.\n6.3\nSolve DP Imbalance\nInsight 2: It is only necessary to maintain load balance at each\ntime step when pipeline parallelism is not applied.\nIf only apply DP without PP, achieving load balance only\nrequires that, at any given time, the micro-batches executed\n8\n\n\nAlgorithm 2: Balance Strategy for HDP\nInput: Global Batch B = {𝑠0,𝑠1, . . . ,𝑠𝑛}, Rank\nCapacity 𝐶, HDP Degree 𝑑ℎ𝑑𝑝, Delta 𝛿\nOutput: micro-batches for HDP Ranks\n1 Initialize micro_batches = [ ] × 𝑑ℎ𝑑𝑝;\n2 Initialize exec_times = [0] × 𝑑ℎ𝑑𝑝;\n3 # Step 1: Sort and Bucketize\n4 Sort B by sequence length in descending order;\n5 Divide B into buckets such that each bucket has an\napproximately equal sum of FLOPs;\n6 while buckets is not empty do\n7\n# Step 2: Identify Target Ranks\n8\nCalculate max_time = max(exec_times);\n9\nDetermine target_ranks = {𝑖|\nmax_time −exec_times[𝑖] > 𝛿};\n10\n# Step 3: Assign Sequences\n11\nwhile Exist (max_time −exec_times[𝑖] > 𝛿) do\n12\nif using DP-Balance strategy then\n13\nSelect 𝑠𝑒𝑞𝑠from the first bucket;\n14\nelse if using PP-Balance strategy then\n15\nSelect 𝑠𝑒𝑞𝑠sequentially from all buckets;\n16\nAssign 𝑠𝑒𝑞𝑠to target_ranks;\n17\nUpdate micro_batches and exec_times;\n18\nUpdate target_ranks based on exec_times;\n19\nif exist bucket is empty then\n20\nRemove bucket from buckets;\n21 Return micro_batches\nby different HDP ranks have similar execution times. There\nis no need to consider the workload imbalance between\nmicro-batches across different time steps on the timeline.\nA straightforward method is to assign sequences of the\nsame length level across different HDP ranks at the same\ntime, as shown in Figure 13(a). Moreover, we still assign more\nmicro-batches to those ranks that process shorter sequences\nthan others at the same time. Finally, it ensures that all HDP\nranks synchronize gradients nearly simultaneously.\n6.4\nBalance Strategy\nAlg. 2 describes the balance strategy. Firstly, we sort the\nsequences in the global batch B by length in descending order.\nThese ordered sequences are then divided into buckets with\napproximately equal sum of FLOPs, and thus the buckets\nwith longer average lengths contain fewer sequences (lines\n3-5). Secondly, we determine those ranks that have shorter\nexecution times for later assignments (lines 7-9). Thirdly, if\nusing the DP-Balance strategy, we select sequences from the\nsame bucket. Otherwise, if using the PP-Balance strategy,\nwe select the sequences sequentially from all buckets. In\npractice, ranks with shorter execution times are assigned\nGPU0\nGPU1\nGPU2\nGPU3\nseq0\nQ0\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nKV0\nKV1\nKV2\nKV3\n(a) standard causal mask\n(b) segmented causal mask\nseq1\nseq2\n(d) balanced segmented causal mask\n(e) balanced dist-attn with packing\n(c) heterogeneous \ncommunication\n(f) homogeneous \ncommunication\nFigure 14.

Finally, we repeat the\nsecond and third steps until all the buckets are empty.\n7\nImplementation\nByteScale is implemented in approximately 16K lines of\ncode based on Python, C++, and CUDA. It has been inte-\ngrated with MegaScale [18], a high-performance framework\nfor LLM training. To support large-scale training and com-\nmunication, we also apply the following optimizations.\nGQA. Group Query Attention (GQA) has become an indis-\npensable feature in modern LLMs (e.g. LlaMA3 and Mistral),\nit helps reduce the number of KV heads, thereby decreas-\ning the communication volume for dist-attn. All systems\nmentioned in this paper apply the GQA technique.\nDist-attn with Packing. As workload is proportional to\nthe area of the attention mask, sequentially partitioning the\nsequence across devices causes workload imbalance. Several\ntechniques [4, 23, 31] have been proposed to solve this issue.\nHowever, they are not suitable for the special segmented\ncausal attention mask for packed sequences. As illustrated\nin Figure 14, to avoid heterogeneous computation and com-\nmunication within the CP group, we optimize the current\ndist-attn. Each subsequence of the packed sequences is uni-\nformly divided into 2𝑁parts and symmetrically assigned\nto the 𝑁devices. It ensures that each device holds 1\n𝑁of all\nthe subsequences and covers 1\n𝑁of the attention mask area.\nAll devices participate in the same ring-P2P communication,\nwith the same data exchange volume.\nRemote Dataloader. ByteScale requires global batch\ninformation at each training step to schedule data assign-\nment. However, existing dataloader solutions typically follow\nSPMD (Single Program, Multiple Data) mode, where each\nrank reads only partial data of the batch. To maintain the\nglobal information, all HDP ranks have to read the entire\n9\n\n\nscheduler (worker0)\nserver (worker0)\nserver (worker1)\nmeta\nmeta\nclient\n(worker0)\nclient\n(worker0)\nclient\n(worker1)\nclient\n(worker1)\nloading plan\ndata\ndata\ndata slice#1\ndata slice#0\nsingle \ncontroller\nray \nhead\nFigure 15.

To\naddress this issue, we implement a remote dataloader using\nRay [26], which provides real-time scheduling and planning\ncapabilities in a global view. As shown in Figure 15, consider\na setup with two GPU nodes, worker-0 and worker-1, and\none CPU node as the Ray head, there exist three types of\nroles encapsulated by ray actors. The Server Roles are CPU\nprocesses in worker nodes, which fetch and preprocess raw\ndata from HDFS and generate metadata. The Scheduler Role,\nas the single controller, is a CPU process in worker-0, which\ncollects the global metadata from all servers, deduces the\nloading plan, and broadcasts it to clients. The Client Roles\nare GPU processes in worker nodes, which read the partial\ndata from servers based on the loading plan.\nFused SoftmaxCrossEntropy. Modern LLMs typically\nuse tokenizers with a large vocabulary size (e.g. 128K in\nLLaMA3 [11], 130K in Mistral [2] and over 150K in Qwen2.5 [43]).\nTo stabilize precision, current methods (e.g. VocabParallel in\nMegatron-LM) convert the logits variable from BF16 to FP32\nbefore calculating the SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss. However,\nFP32 logits consume significant memory. For instance, with\na context length of 256K and a vocabulary size of 128K, it\nrequires 16GB under TP=8. Besides, the kernels are memory-\nbound and inefficient. As illustrated in Figure 16, we develop\nFusedSoftmaxCrossEntropy, which fuses numerous opera-\ntions into a single kernel, takes BF16 inputs, and still per-\nforms online computations in FP32 precision. It saves both\ntime and memory compared to existing methods.\n8\nExperiments\n8.1\nExperimental Setup\nEnvironments. Our experiments are conducted on a large-\nscale productive GPU cluster with more than 12,000 GPUs.\n(The specific information regarding the productive cluster, such\nas the number and type of GPUs, is hidden due to business and\nconfidential concerns.)\nBaselines. Our system is built on MegaScale, a productive\nLLM training framework for large-scale GPU clusters, which\nhas demonstrated superior performance to DeepSpeed and\nMegatron-LM. Thus, we present the advantages of ByteScale\nTable 1.

To achieve\na fair comparison, we set the same 𝑑𝑡𝑝and 𝑑𝑝𝑝for all three\ncases and set the 𝑑ℎ𝑑𝑝in 2○3○equal to 𝑑𝑑𝑝×𝑑𝑐𝑝in 1○, where\nthe 𝑑𝑐𝑝corresponds the minimum required number of ranks\nto support the context length of model.\nModels and Datasets. We evaluate our work with both\ndense and sparse LLMs, as detailed in Table 1. For the dense\nmodel, we choose the LLaMA-series LLMs with four different\nsizes, LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, LLaMA-30B, and LLaMA-70B.\nFor the sparse model, we choose the Mistral-series LLMs\n(MoE) with two different sizes, Mistral-8x7B (active param-\neters = 13B/47B) and Mistral-8×22B (active parameters =\n39B/141B). Two datasets are used in our experiments, i.e.,\nGitHub and Byted, as we have introduced in §3.1. Figure 4\nillustrates the data distribution for these two datasets.\nWorkloads and Metrics. For different types and sizes of\nmodels, we scale the context length from 256K to 2M, and\nthe cluster size from 1024 GPUs to more than 12,000 GPUs to\nassess the performance of ByteScale more comprehensively.\nThe global batch for each training step is fixed to 32M tokens,\nas it’s a common practice in large-scale clusters. We use the\nthroughput (tokens per second) as the primary metric to\nevaluate the performance. All results are averaged over 200\niterations after a 20-iteration warmup.\n8.2\nEnd-to-End Evaluation\nWe first assess the end-to-end performance of three methods\nby measuring the average throughput at each training step,\nthe overall results are shown in Figure 17. It turns out that\nboth the HDP naive and balance solutions outperform the\nbaseline, achieving a maximum speedup of 7.89×.\nDifference in Scalability. As context length increases,\nthe baseline with static strategies must increase the CP de-\ngree to avoid OOM errors. For shorter sequences within the\nglobal batch, we have to pack them and apply the dist-attn\nshown in Figure 14, which suffers from inefficient and redun-\ndant communication.

Case Study\nand scaling the context length from 256K to 2M, we can ob-\nserve that the throughput of the baseline decreases nearly 2×\nwhenever context length increases 2×. In contrast, under the\nsame conditions, the throughput of the HDP naive solution\ndecreases by 1.23× on average and the throughput of the\nHDP balance solution decreases by only 1.08× on average.\nThe HDP naive solution reduces communication overhead\nbut leaves some ranks idle due to imbalance. Meanwhile, the\nHDP balance solution eliminates these bubble times and fully\nreleases the performance enabled by flexible and dynamic\ncommunication. Consequently, ByteScale outperforms the\nbaseline by up to 7.89× on the GitHub dataset.\nDifference in Datasets. The Byted dataset contains more\nlong sequences than the GitHub dataset, and there exist 37%\nof the tokens in a global batch are longer than 256K. As a\nresult, the average throughput and speedup are lower than\nthat on the GitHub dataset. However, because ByteScale\nprovides communication optimizations for both long and\nshort sequences, the speedup can still achieve up to 4.26×.\nDifference in Parallelism Strategies. Models like LLaMA-\n7B, 13B and 30B use parallelism strategies including HDP\nand TP, thus applying the DP-Balance strategy. In contrast,\nmodels like LLaMA-70B, Mistral-8×7B and Mistral-8×22B\nemploy HDP, TP and PP, and we apply the PP-Balance strat-\negy. It can be observed that HDP with DP-Balance achieves\na higher speedup, compared to the PP-Balance. For instance,\nwith the GitHub dataset and a context length of 2M, the\nspeedup of HDP with DP-Balance is between 6.21×-7.89×,\nwhile the speedup of HDP with PP-Balance is only between\n3.42×-4.28×. As shown in Figure 13, the DP-Balance strategy\nonly needs to balance computation at each time step, which\nis easier to achieve than balance computation across all time\nsteps, as required by the PP-Balance strategy.\n11\n\n\n0\n30\n60\n90\n120\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nThroughput (Gb/s)\nRDMA Out Traffic for Baseline\n0\n30\n60\n90\n120\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nThroughput (Gb/s)\nRDMA Out Traffic for HDP Naive\n0\n30\n60\n90\n120\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nThroughput (Gb/s)\nRDMA Out Traffic for HDP Balance\n0\n30\n60\n90\n120\nTime (min)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nUtilization (%)\nGPU Tensor Core Activity for Baseline\n0\n30\n60\n90\n120\nTime (min)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nUtilization (%)\nGPU Tensor Core Activity for HDP Naive\n0\n30\n60\n90\n120\nTime (min)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nUtilization (%)\nGPU Tensor Core Activity for HDP Balance\nFigure 19.

Ablation Study\n8.3\nCase Studies\nTo anatomize the super performance of ByteScale more in-\ndeep, we choose the Byted dataset and conduct experiments\nby training LLaMA-7B with 2M context length on a cluster\nwith 1024 GPUs. Figure 18 presents the detailed runtime\nstatus of different ranks during a single training step.\nCommunication-Bound Case. Firstly, we randomly se-\nlect 4 ranks from the cluster, and record their forward and\nbackward times within the training step for each method.\nAs illustrated in Figure 18(b), for the baseline, the number\nof micro-batches is set as 8, and we have to set 𝑑𝑐𝑝= 256 to\nsupport the sequence length of 2M. It can be observed that\nthese 4 ranks exhibit similar execution times. This is because\nmost micro-batches (except the third one) do not have the\ncomputational complexity of 𝑂((2𝑀)2), but have to handle\nthe communication volume for 2M. As shown in Figure 18(a),\nthe P2P communication time far exceeds the computation\ntime, causing the execution time of a micro-batch almost\ndetermined by communication (97.6% of the total time).\nComputation-Imbalance Case. Under the HDP naive\nsolution, sequences within a global batch are sharded by\nthe minimal required number of ranks. As illustrated in Fig-\nure 18(a), a 312K sequence is sharded by only 39 HDP ranks\nto serve as micro-batches, and thus the computation time can\noverlap the communication overhead. However, the training\ninefficiency still exists due to the imbalance across ranks. As\nshown in Figure 18(b), although the third rank completes\nits 8 micro-batches in 1m41s, it has to wait for the first rank\nto finish at 4m32s, leading to 171s of idle time. Even so, the\nHDP naive solution saves 4m8s compared to the baseline.\nrecompute\noffload=1.0\noffload=0.8\noffload=0.6\noffload=0.5\nnormal\n0.0\n2.5\n5.0\n7.5\nE2E Time (s)\n6.70 s\n(\n -31.7%)\n6.49 s\n(\n -27.7%)\n5.93 s\n(\n -16.5%)\n5.38 s\n(\n -5.8%)\n5.08 s\n(\n 0.0%)\n5.08 s\nrecompute\noffload=1.0\noffload=0.8\noffload=0.6\noffload=0.5\nnormal\n0\n20\n40\n60\nMemory Usage (GB)\n27 GB\n(\n 54.2%)\n27 GB\n(\n 54.2%)\n33 GB\n(\n 44.1%)\n37 GB\n(\n 37.3%)\n40 GB\n(\n 32.2%)\n59 GB\nFigure 21. Effectiveness of Activation Offloading\nBalance Case. Under the HDP balance solution, all ranks\nfinish execution nearly at the same time. As shown in Fig-\nure 18(b), at any time step, each rank is assigned micro-\nbatches with similar FLOPs, and ranks with shorter execution\ntimes (e.g. the third and fourth ranks) will be assigned more\nbatches. Consequently, the total time of this step is further\nreduced to 2m37s, saving 6m3s compared to the baseline.\nOverall Comparison. As shown in Figure 18(c), we record\nthe valid computation time in a single step for all the 1024\nGPUs. It can be found that the HDP naive solution reduces\nthe peak execution time by 1.7× compared to the baseline,\nbut suffers from significant time variance across ranks, with\na 4.7× difference between the maximum and the minimum\nvalue (min=60s, max=279s, std=68s). The HDP balance solu-\ntion eliminates the time variance, thereby further reducing\nexecution time by 2.3× compared to the naive solution.\n8.4\nAblation Studies\nTo dive into the effectiveness of each component within\nByteScale, we further conduct ablation experiments using\nthe same configuration as §8.3, as shown in Figure 20.\nEffectiveness of Dynamic Communication. While Fig-\nure 18 provides a snapshot of runtime during a single training\nstep, we further profile the network traffic and tensor core\nutilization over two hours, as shown in Figure 19. It can\nbe observed that the baseline exhibits very heavy RDMA\ntraffic, yet the corresponding tensor core utilization is low.\nThis is because most ranks are communication-bound, and\n12\n\n\nthe computational units remain idle most of the time due to\nwaiting for redundant communication. This observation is\nconsistent with the situation depicted in Figure 18(a). When\nwe apply the HDP naive solution, the peak RDMA traffic\nis nearly halved, indicating that a significant amount of un-\nnecessary communication has been eliminated. Besides, the\ntensor core utilization also increases from 10% to 40%. Thus\nit achieves a speedup of 1.59× compared to baseline. How-\never, due to the imbalance issue, these improvements are not\nstable, and both communication and computation hardware\nunits occasionally experience stalls or idle periods.\nEffectiveness of Selective Offloading. Selective offload-\ning serves as a complement to the HDP naive solution. As\nshown in Figure 21, activation offloading with ratio 𝑟= 1.0\nsaves the same memory as recomputation. As the context\nlength is set to 64K, the computation cannot fully overlap\nwith offloading. However, as we reduce the ratio to 𝑟= 0.5,\nit can save 32.3% of memory without compromising through-\nput. Furthermore, the offload ratio is automatically derived\nfrom Eq 3, as the context length increases, a higher ratio can\nbe set to save more memory (e.g. set 𝑟= 1.0 for 256K will\nnot decrease throughput). This method reduces the number\nof ranks for longer sequences, enabling more sequences to\nbe processed simultaneously with the same number of ranks,\nthereby improving speedup from 1.59× to 2.01×.\nEffectiveness of Balance Strategy. As illustrated in Fig-\nure 19, the balance strategy stables the RDMA traffic and\nmakes the tensor core utilization consistently around 40%.\nThis indicates that the hardware units of both computation\nand communication continuously work at full load for over\ntwo hours without idling. Consequently, the HDP Balance\nsolution achieves a speedup from 2.01× to 3.69×, surpassing\nthe improvements by any other strategy.\nEffectiveness of Remote Dataloader. We employ the\nremote loader depicted in Figure 15 and use CPU prefetching\nto overlap data reading with computation. This approach\nfurther improves the speedup from 3.69× to 3.89×.\n9\nConclusion\nWe proposed ByteScale, an efficient, flexible and scalable\ndistributed LLM training framework for large-scale mixed\ntraining of long and short sequences. We develop the commu-\nnication optimizer to eliminate redundant communication\nand build the balance scheduler to mitigate the imbalanced\ncomputation. We evaluate ByteScale on a production clus-\nter with more than 12,000 GPUs, and scale the model size\nfrom 7B to 141B and the context length from 256K to 2M,\nexperiment results show that it outperforms MegaScale by\nup to 7.89×.\nReferences\n[1] Sahar Abdelnabi, Amr Gomaa, Sarath Sivaprasad, Lea Schönherr, and\nMario Fritz. 2023.

{"text": "ALVI Interface: Towards Full Hand Motion Decoding\nfor Amputees Using sEMG\nAleksandr Kovalev\nAnna Makarova\nPetr Chizhov\nMatvey Antonov\nGleb Duplin\nVladislav Lomtev\nViacheslav Gostevskii\nVladimir Bessonov\nAndrey Tsurkan\nMikhail Korobok\nAleksejs Timˇcenko\nALVI Labs\nkoval.alvi@gmail.com\nAbstract\nWe present a system for decoding hand movements using surface EMG signals.\nThe interface provides real-time (25 Hz) reconstruction of finger joint angles\nacross 20 degrees of freedom, designed for upper limb amputees. Our offline\nanalysis shows 0.8 correlation between predicted and actual hand movements. The\nsystem functions as an integrated pipeline with three key components: (1) a VR-\nbased data collection platform, (2) a transformer-based model for EMG-to-motion\ntransformation, and (3) a real-time calibration and feedback module called ALVI\nInterface. Using eight sEMG sensors and a VR training environment, users can\ncontrol their virtual hand down to finger joint movement precision, as demonstrated\nin our video: youtube link.\n1\nIntroduction\nUpper limb amputation has substantial physical, psychological, and occupational impacts on individ-\nuals (1). Even the most advanced bioelectric prostheses cannot completely solve the problem of low\ndegree of freedom and control flexibility, which is relevant for the users. The main challenge is to\ncreate a universal and convenient control system for the prosthesis, simulating the natural control\nof a real hand. In recent works (2; 3), authors have presented systems that convert muscle electrical\nsignals from the surface of the forearm (sEMG) into precise hand movements in healthy people.\nHowever, for people with amputation, creating such a system remains difficult due to the absence\nof target movements to train the decoders.(4; 5) In this study, we present a system for decoding\nindividual finger movements using sEMG signals for people with hand amputation in real-time. Our\napproach includes:\n• a VR setup for collecting paired datasets of finger movements and forearm muscle activity\nin amputees, which provides essential training data;\n• a transformer-based model for decoding individual finger movements from sEMG signals,\nwhich processes this data;\n• the ALVI Interface, a real-time system that enables adaptive control and visualization of a\nvirtual hand with 20 degrees of freedom.\n2\nMethods\n2.1\nDataset\nWe developed a VR application to collect accurate hand movement data from amputees, crucial for\ntraining our sEMG-based decoding algorithm (6). The system consists of three main components:\narXiv:2502.21256v1  [cs.LG]  28 Feb 2025\n\n\nan experimental environment, a hand reflection module, and a data aggregation module (figure 1).\nThe VR environment features a display screen that shows instructions and guides users through\nspecific movement sequences. This controlled setting enables participants to practice diverse hand\nmotions while receiving real-time visual feedback. The hand reflection module was specifically\ndesigned to precisely capture target finger positions for the amputated hand. This is accomplished by\ntracking the coordinates of the fingers on the participant’s intact hand using the Oculus Quest hand\ntracking system. These coordinates are then mirrored to create a virtual 3D model of the absent hand,\nreflecting the movements of the intact hand in a symmetrical manner. The data aggregation module\nsynchronizes all input data, including finger positions and signals from sEMG sensors (obtained via\nwireless Myo Armband by Thalmic Labs). We used the open-source Lab Streaming Layer (LSL)\nframework (7) to facilitate precise time-synchronized streaming of all data channels in real-time.\nFigure 1: Data collection system. Participant with VR headset and sEMG armband performs\nmovements with intact hand. System tracks movements, mirrors them to create virtual model of\nabsent hand, and records muscle activity from residual limb.\nWe implemented real-time inference for prosthetic hand control. After a brief calibration with simple\ngestures, users can perform any movement and see the virtual hand respond in the real-time.\nExperiment\nOur experiment included 72 daily-life gestures (45 dynamic, 27 static), performed\nsymmetrically with both hands. We had 22 participants (20 non-amputees, 2 amputees), each\ncompleting 3 sessions on different days: 2 for training and 1 for testing. Sessions lasted 1-1.5 hours,\nwith movements repeated for 1 minute each.\nData preprocessing\nRaw EMG activity (200 Hz sampling frequency) is normalized to the [-1, 1]\nrange using min-max scaling. Target movements are encoded as quaternions for 21 joint orientations,\nnormalized relative to the palm position. We extract 4 angles for each finger, following the approach\npresented in NeuroPose3D. The electrode order for the left-hand data is rearranged to match the\nright-hand configuration to enable cross-hand compatibility. Movement data is downsampled from 40\nHz to 25 Hz for real-time processing. Our many-to-many approach uses a 1.28-second input window\n(8 channels, 256 time points) to predict 32 time points of 20 movement-encoding variables.\n2.2\nModel\nWe introduce HandFormer, a transformer-based architecture designed for EMG-to-motion translation.\nThe model consists of an Encoder and a Decoder, optimized for processing EMG signals and\ngenerating hand movements. The EMG data are split into patches, each patch representing one\nelectrode’s activity over 8 time points (input shape: [8, 256], patch size (1, 8), resulting in 256\ntotal tokens). The encoder processes tokenized EMG data to extract relevant features. The Decoder\nemploys a Perceiver-like architecture (8) with 32 learnable queries that match the number of movement\nframes. Notably, we use non-autoregressive prediction, which empirically outperforms autoregressive\n2\n\n\napproaches for our task. HandFormer’s pretraining consists of two sequential stages. The first\nstage, EMG Encoder Pretraining, implements a masked autoencoder architecture (9) with 70% token\nmasking to learn EMG signal patterns. In the second stage, we use the pretrained encoder weights for\nfull model training, optimizing hand pose predictions using L1 loss between the predicted and target\njoint angles.\nFigure 2: Architecture of the model. The HandFormer architecture transforms muscle activity\n(sEMG) into hand movements through a two-stage process. The Encoder (left) tokenizes sEMG\nsignals from 8 channels into patches and extracts relevant features. The Decoder (right) employs a\nPerceiver-like architecture with 32 learnable queries corresponding to predicted movement frames.\nThis non-autoregressive design enables efficient real-time translation of muscle signals into precise\nfinger joint angles across 20 degrees of freedom.\n2.3\nALVI Interface\nBuilding upon our data collection platform, ALVI Interface extends the system from passive recording\nto active bidirectional control. While the initial system focuses on capturing training data, ALVI adds\nreal-time decoding, visual feedback, and adaptive tuning capabilities, enabling users to immediately\nsee their intended movements and participate in refining the model through interactive training.\nThis evolution creates a comprehensive motion decoding system that enables practical, personalized\ncontrol for amputees.

Laptop processes\nsEMG signals to generate real-time hand movement predictions displayed in VR. Simultaneously, data\nis streamed to the AI server, which continuously updates the prediction model and sends improved\nweights back to the laptop, creating an adaptive learning loop between the system and user.\nInteractive Adaptation: ALVI Interface implements a novel approach to model calibration through\ninteractive real-time training. During a 10-minute session, users perform movements while simulta-\nneously observing their virtual hand’s response, allowing them to:\n• Immediately see the quality of movement reconstruction\n• Focus on specific gestures that need improvement\n• Actively guide the training process based on visual feedback\nThe system continuously finetunes the pretrained HandFormer model to the user’s sEMG patterns,\nupdating weights every 10 seconds. This interactive loop combines both new and historical data,\nensuring that each session builds upon previous ones while adapting to current conditions. The\nchallenge of implementing closed-loop adaptive systems with real-time constraints is also being\naddressed in brain-computer interfaces, as demonstrated by the BRAND platform (10).\nReal-time Performance: The system processes sEMG signals through a 256-point sliding window\nat 200 Hz, predicting 32 frames of movement at 25 Hz. It uses the most recent predicted frame for\nimmediate control, with exponential moving average applied to joint angles for smoothness. This\nenables responsive, natural hand control with minimal latency.\nAfter initial adaptation, the Interface runs independently on the laptop, enabling seamless hand control\nin VR without requiring constant server connection. This architecture provides a practical foundation\nfor long-term prosthetic control in virtual environments, significantly enhancing user autonomy and\nexperience.\n3\nResults\nOur system demonstrated strong performance in both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments.\nThe evaluation was conducted across three key dimensions: offline accuracy, real-time performance,\nand user experience.\nQuantitative Performance\nIn offline testing with 22 participants (20 non-amputees, 2 amputees),\nthe system achieved finger movement reconstruction with a correlation of 0.86 for non-amputee\nparticipants and 0.80 for amputee participants. The mean angular error was 8.09° and 14.50°\nrespectively. Notably, our system is among the first to demonstrate such high performance levels for\namputee users.\nTable 1: Performance comparison between non-amputees and amputees\nSubject Group\nAngle error (◦)\nCorrelation\nNon-amputees\n8.09\n0.86\nAmputees\n14.50\n0.80\nReal-time Performance\nThe system operates in real-time at 25 Hz with a latency of 51.2 ms\n(1.28-second window / 25 frames). After a 10-minute calibration period, users can perform natural\nhand movements in VR with smooth response. The continuous adaptation mechanism maintains\nconsistent performance throughout extended usage sessions, with model weights updating every 10\nseconds based on new sEMG patterns.\nUser Experience\nWe conducted extensive qualitative evaluation with amputee participants (n=2)\nover multiple sessions. Our participants’ interaction with the system revealed an interesting learning\ndynamic. Initially, users performed predefined gestures without system feedback to establish baseline\ndata collection. After implementing real-time feedback through ALVI Interface, we observed\n4\n\n\nsignificant improvements in control quality. Within the first 10 minutes of interactive training, users\ngained precise control over individual finger movements, showing rapid adaptation to the system.\nA particularly interesting finding emerged after 30 minutes of use, when participants reported a\nmutual learning phenomenon - both the system and users adapted their behavior to achieve better\nresults, similar to findings reported in other myoelectric interfaces (11).\nUsers noticed they were unconsciously adjusting their muscle activation patterns to match the model’s\nexpected inputs, while the system continuously refined its predictions based on user behavior.\nThe system’s ability to retain personalized models across sessions proved valuable. Each subsequent\nsession required less adaptation time, as both the system and user retained their learned patterns\nfrom previous interactions. This continuous improvement cycle created an increasingly natural and\nresponsive interface, with users reporting more intuitive control in each session.\nThese observations suggest that our approach of combining initial structured training with interactive\nlearning leads to a more personalized and effective user experience. The decreasing adaptation time\nacross sessions indicates successful long-term learning on both the system and user sides.\n4\nDiscussion\nOur findings indicate that ALVI Interface can provide high-fidelity finger movement decoding in\nreal-time using sEMG signals, even for individuals with upper limb amputation. A key challenge\nremains the inherent variability of sEMG signals—affected by electrode placement, muscle fatigue,\nand day-to-day fluctuations—necessitating regular calibration. Our co-adaptive approach offers a\npractical solution: the system continuously updates the model based on user input while users adapt\ntheir muscle activation patterns, resulting in rapid proficiency gains within each session.\nThis co-adaptation capability is particularly valuable for individuals with amputation, as they can\nquickly learn fine motor control in VR. Over multiple sessions, participants reported a growing sense\nof intuitive control, suggesting that sustained use further refines both the user’s activation strategy\nand the system’s decoding performance. Beyond prosthetic control, the same methodology could\nbenefit stroke or injury rehabilitation by providing real-time visualization of intended movements,\nenhancing both patient motivation and clinical insights.\nWhile the results are promising, larger clinical trials with more amputees are needed to generalize\nthese findings and address known challenges in myoelectric prosthesis control (12). Future work\nwill focus on improving the long-term stability of the interface, integrating position-invariant sEMG\ndecoding, and exploring advanced adaptation techniques to reduce calibration frequency. Further\nresearch should also investigate integrating ALVI with physical prostheses for real-world tasks, as\nwell as exploring how VR-based training might accelerate users’ functional recovery.\nReferences\n[1] H Shahsavari, P Matourypour, S Ghiyasvandian, A Ghorbani, F Bakhshi, M Mahmoudi, et al.\nUpper limb amputation; care needs for reintegration to life: An integrative review.
