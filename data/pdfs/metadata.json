    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the natural language processing\nlandscape and brought to life diverse applications. Pretraining on vast\nweb-scale data has laid the foundation for these models, yet the research\ncommunity is now increasingly shifting focus toward post-training techniques to\nachieve further breakthroughs. While pretraining provides a broad linguistic\nfoundation, post-training methods enable LLMs to refine their knowledge,\nimprove reasoning, enhance factual accuracy, and align more effectively with\nuser intents and ethical considerations. Fine-tuning, reinforcement learning,\nand test-time scaling have emerged as critical strategies for optimizing LLMs\nperformance, ensuring robustness, and improving adaptability across various\nreal-world tasks. This survey provides a systematic exploration of\npost-training methodologies, analyzing their role in refining LLMs beyond\npretraining, addressing key challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, reward\nhacking, and inference-time trade-offs. We highlight emerging directions in\nmodel alignment, scalable adaptation, and inference-time reasoning, and outline\nfuture research directions. We also provide a public repository to continually\ntrack developments in this fast-evolving field:\nhttps://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Awesome-LLM-Post-training.",

    "abstract": "Standard Model (SM) with 15 Weyl fermions per family (lacking the 16th, the\nsterile right-handed neutrino $\\nu_R$) suffers from mixed gauge-gravitational\nanomalies tied to baryon number plus or minus lepton number ${\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf\nL}$ symmetry. Including $\\nu_R$ per family can cancel these anomalies, but when\n${\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf L}$ symmetry is preserved as discrete finite subgroups rather\nthan a continuous U(1), the perturbative local anomalies become nonperturbative\nglobal anomalies. In this work, we systematically enumerate these\ngauge-gravitational global anomalies involving discrete ${\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf L}$\nthat are enhanced from the fermion parity $\\mathbb{Z}_2^{\\rm F}$ to\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\\rm F}$, with $N=2,3,4,6,9$, etc. The ${\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf L}$\ndiscreteness is constrained by multi-fermion deformations beyond-the-SM and the\nfamily number $N_f$. Unlike the free quadratic $\\nu_R$ Majorana mass gap\npreserving the minimal $\\mathbb{Z}_2^{\\rm F}$, we explore novel scenarios\ncanceling $({\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf L})$-gravitational anomalies while preserving the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\\rm F}$ discrete symmetries, featuring 4d interacting gapped\ntopological orders (potentially with or without low-energy TQFT descriptions)\nor gapless sectors (e.g., conformal field theories). We propose anomalous\nsectors as quantum dark matter to cancel SM's global anomalies. We find the\n$N_f=3$ uniqueness, when the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\\rm F}$ representation from the\nfaithful ${\\bf B} + {\\bf L}$ for baryons at $N=N_c=3$ is extended to the\nfaithful ${\\bf Q} + N_c {\\bf L}$ for quarks at $N=N_c N_f=9$, this symmetry\nextension matches with the topological order dark matter construction. Key\nimplications include: (1) a 5th force mediating between SM and dark matter via\ndiscrete gauge fields. (2) dark matter as topological order quantum matter with\ngapped anyon excitations at ends of extended defects. (3) topological\nleptogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Persuasive dialogue plays a pivotal role in human communication, influencing\nvarious domains. Recent persuasive dialogue datasets often fail to align with\nreal-world interpersonal interactions, leading to unfaithful representations.\nFor instance, unrealistic scenarios may arise, such as when the persuadee\nexplicitly instructs the persuader on which persuasion strategies to employ,\nwith each of the persuadee's questions corresponding to a specific strategy for\nthe persuader to follow. This issue can be attributed to a violation of the\n\"Double Blind\" condition, where critical information is fully shared between\nparticipants. In actual human interactions, however, key information such as\nthe mental state of the persuadee and the persuasion strategies of the\npersuader is not directly accessible. The persuader must infer the persuadee's\nmental state using Theory of Mind capabilities and construct arguments that\nalign with the persuadee's motivations. To address this gap, we introduce\nToMMA, a novel multi-agent framework for dialogue generation that is guided by\ncausal Theory of Mind. This framework ensures that information remains\nundisclosed between agents, preserving \"double-blind\" conditions, while causal\nToM directs the persuader's reasoning, enhancing alignment with human-like\npersuasion dynamics. Consequently, we present CToMPersu, a multi-domain,\nmulti-turn persuasive dialogue dataset that tackles both double-blind and\nlogical coherence issues, demonstrating superior performance across multiple\nmetrics and achieving better alignment with real human dialogues.

    "abstract": "Forecasting violent rockbursts remains a formidable challenge due to\nsignificant uncertainties involved. One major uncertainty arises from the\nintermittency of rock failure processes, typically characterised by a series of\nprogressively shorter quiescent phases punctuated by sudden accelerations,\nrather than a smooth continuous progression towards the final breakdown. This\nnon-monotonic evolution of rock mass deformation complicates rockburst\nprediction, challenging conventional time-to-failure models that often assume a\nsmooth power law accelerating behaviour. Here, we introduce a generalised\ntime-to-failure model called log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) model\nto effectively capture the intermittent dynamics of damage and rupture\nprocesses in rock leading up to violent rockbursts. We perform parametric and\nnonparametric tests on 11 historical rockburst events at three underground\nmines, documenting empirical evidence and providing theoretical arguments to\ndemonstrate the significance of log-periodic oscillatory power law finite-time\nsingularities. Log-periodicity in these rockburst events is likely driven by\nthe interaction of subparallel propagating cracks, the diffusion of\nstress-triggering processes, or the interplay between stress drop and stress\ncorrosion. Our results and insights obtained have significant implications for\nnot only understanding but also forecasting rockbursts, as recognising and\ncharacterising log-periodicity can help transform intermittency from\ntraditionally perceived noise into valuable predictive information.",

The resulting normal forms provide an approximation to the\noriginal FPUT lattice that possesses a significant number of exact quadratic\nconservation laws, beyond the quadratic part of the Hamiltonian. We call the\nnew equations \"exact-resonance evolution equations\" and examine their\nproperties: (i) Heisenberg representation's slow evolution allows us to\nimplement numerical methods with large time steps to obtain relevant dynamical\ninformation, such as Lyapunov exponents. (ii) We introduce tests, such as\nconvergence of the normal form transformation and truncation error\nverification, to successfully validate our exact-resonance evolution equations.\n(iii) The systematic construction of new quadratic invariants (via the resonant\ncluster matrix) allows us to use finite-time Lyapunov exponent calculations to\nquantify the level of nonlinearity at which the original FPUT lattice is well\napproximated by the exact-resonance evolution equations. We show numerical\nexperiments in the case $N=9$, but the theory and numerical methods are valid\nfor arbitrary values of $N$. We conclude that, when $3$ divides $N$, at small\nenough nonlinearity the FPUT lattice's dynamics and nontrivial hyperchaos are\ngoverned by $5$-wave resonant interactions.",

In both SCDT and\nCDWT configurations, the rotor is placed a distance behind the throat of the\nduct.

A key source of\nuncertainty arises from the sporadic nature of volcanic unrest, which is often\ncharacterised by intermittent phases of quiescent deceleration and sudden\nacceleration, rather than a consistent, predictable progression towards\neruption. This seemingly erratic pattern complicates volcano forecasting as it\nchallenges conventional time-to-failure models that often assume a simple\nsmooth power law acceleration. We propose a log-periodic power law singularity\nmodel, which effectively captures the intermittent and non-monotonic rupture\ndynamics characteristic of reawakening volcanoes at the site scale.\nMathematically, generalising the power law exponent by extending it from real\nto complex numbers, this model captures the partial break of continuous scale\ninvariance to discrete scale invariance that is inherent to the intermittent\ndynamics of damage and rupture processes in heterogeneous crustal systems. By\nperforming parametric and nonparametric tests on a large dataset of 34\nhistorical eruptions worldwide, we present empirical evidence and theoretical\narguments demonstrating the statistical significance of log-periodic\noscillations decorating power law finite-time singularities during pre-eruptive\nvolcanic unrest. Log-periodicity in volcanoes may originate from various\nmechanisms, including diffusion-dominated magma flow, magma-driven propagation\nof subparallel dykes, interaction between stress drop and stress corrosion,\nand/or interplay of inertia, damage, and healing within volcanic systems.

    "abstract": "Gene drive alleles bias their own inheritance to offspring. They can fix in a\nwild-type population in spite of a fitness cost, and even lead to the\neradication of the target population if the fitness cost is high. However, this\noutcome may be prevented or delayed if areas previously cleared by the drive\nare recolonised by wild-type individuals. Here, we investigate the conditions\nunder which these stochastic wild-type recolonisation events are likely and\nwhen they are unlikely to occur in one spatial dimension. More precisely, we\nexamine the conditions ensuring that the last individual carrying a wild-type\nallele is surrounded by a large enough number of drive homozygous individuals,\nresulting in a very low chance of wild-type recolonisation. To do so, we make a\ndeterministic approximation of the distribution of drive alleles within the\nwave, and we split the distribution of wild-type alleles into a deterministic\npart and a stochastic part. Our analytical and numerical results suggest that\nthe probability of wild-type recolonisation events increases with lower fitness\nof drive individuals, with smaller migration rate, and also with smaller local\ncarrying capacity. Numerical simulations show that these results extend to two\nspatial dimensions. We also demonstrate that, if a wild-type recolonisation\nevent were to occur, the probability of a following drive reinvasion event\ndecreases with smaller values of the intrinsic growth rate of the population.\nOverall, our study paves the way for further analysis of wild-type\nrecolonisation at the back of eradication traveling waves.",

Recently, foundation models (FMs) leveraging self-supervised\npre-training have been widely advocated as a universal solution for diverse\ndownstream tasks. However, open questions remain about their clinical\napplicability and generalization advantages over end-to-end learning using\ntask-specific (TS) models. Here, we focused on AI with clinical-grade\nperformance for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading. We present the\nlargest validation of AI for this task, using over 100,000 core needle biopsies\nfrom 7,342 patients across 15 sites in 11 countries. We compared two FMs with a\nfully end-to-end TS model in a multiple instance learning framework. Our\nfindings challenge assumptions that FMs universally outperform TS models. While\nFMs demonstrated utility in data-scarce scenarios, their performance converged\nwith - and was in some cases surpassed by - TS models when sufficient labeled\ntraining data were available. Notably, extensive task-specific training\nmarkedly reduced clinically significant misgrading, misdiagnosis of challenging\nmorphologies, and variability across different WSI scanners. Additionally, FMs\nused up to 35 times more energy than the TS model, raising concerns about their\nsustainability. Our results underscore that while FMs offer clear advantages\nfor rapid prototyping and research, their role as a universal solution for\nclinically applicable medical AI remains uncertain. For high-stakes clinical\napplications, rigorous validation and consideration of task-specific training\nremain critically important.

In this work, we propose a novel pre-training strategy\nusing more widely available unannotated head CT scan data to pre-train a 3D\nVision Transformer model prior to fine-tuning for the aneurysm detection task.\nSpecifically, we modify masked auto-encoder (MAE) pre-training in the following\nways: we use a factorized self-attention mechanism to make 3D attention\ncomputationally viable, we restrict the masked patches to areas near arteries\nto focus on areas where aneurysms are likely to occur, and we reconstruct not\nonly CT scan intensity values but also artery distance maps, which describe the\ndistance between each voxel and the closest artery, thereby enhancing the\nbackbone's learned representations. Compared with SOTA aneurysm detection\nmodels, our approach gains +4-8% absolute Sensitivity at a false positive rate\nof 0.5. Code and weights will be released.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across\ndiverse tasks by encoding vast amounts of factual knowledge. However, they are\nstill prone to hallucinations, generating incorrect or misleading information,\noften accompanied by high uncertainty. Existing methods for hallucination\ndetection primarily focus on quantifying internal uncertainty, which arises\nfrom missing or conflicting knowledge within the model. However, hallucinations\ncan also stem from external uncertainty, where ambiguous user queries lead to\nmultiple possible interpretations. In this work, we introduce Semantic Volume,\na novel mathematical measure for quantifying both external and internal\nuncertainty in LLMs. Our approach perturbs queries and responses, embeds them\nin a semantic space, and computes the determinant of the Gram matrix of the\nembedding vectors, capturing their dispersion as a measure of uncertainty. Our\nframework provides a generalizable and unsupervised uncertainty detection\nmethod without requiring white-box access to LLMs. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on both external and internal uncertainty detection, demonstrating\nthat our Semantic Volume method consistently outperforms existing baselines in\nboth tasks. Additionally, we provide theoretical insights linking our measure\nto differential entropy, unifying and extending previous sampling-based\nuncertainty measures such as the semantic entropy. Semantic Volume is shown to\nbe a robust and interpretable approach to improving the reliability of LLMs by\nsystematically detecting uncertainty in both user queries and model responses.",

Data Parallelism) and intra-data\npartitioning (a.k.a. Context Parallelism) are commonly used. Current training\nframeworks predominantly treat the two techniques as orthogonal, and establish\nstatic communication groups to organize the devices as a static mesh (e.g., a\n2D mesh). However, the sequences for LLM training typically vary in lengths, no\nmatter for texts, multi-modalities or reinforcement learning. The mismatch\nbetween data heterogeneity and static mesh causes redundant communication and\nimbalanced computation, degrading the training efficiency.\n  In this work, we introduce ByteScale, an efficient, flexible, and scalable\nLLM training framework for large-scale mixed training of long and short\nsequences. The core of ByteScale is a novel parallelism strategy, namely Hybrid\nData Parallelism (HDP), which unifies the inter- and intra-data partitioning\nwith a dynamic mesh design. In particular, we build a communication optimizer,\nwhich eliminates the redundant communication for short sequences by data-aware\nsharding and dynamic communication, and further compresses the communication\ncost for long sequences by selective offloading. Besides, we also develop a\nbalance scheduler to mitigate the imbalanced computation by parallelism-aware\ndata assignment. We evaluate ByteScale with the model sizes ranging from 7B to\n141B, context lengths from 256K to 2048K, on a production cluster with more\nthan 12,000 GPUs.

Current approaches often distill detailed probabilistic data\ninto higher-level summaries to support tractable and interpretable analyses,\nthough they typically struggle to fully represent the relational and\nprobabilistic hierarchies through single-layered abstractions. We introduce a\nhierarchical probabilistic abstraction framework aimed at addressing these\nchallenges by extending a measure-theoretic foundation for hierarchical\nabstraction. The framework enables modular problem-solving via layered\nmappings, facilitating both detailed layer-specific analysis and a cohesive\nsystem-wide understanding. This approach bridges high-level conceptualization\nwith low-level perceptual data, enhancing interpretability and allowing layered\nanalysis. Our framework provides a robust foundation for abstraction analysis\nacross AI subfields, particularly in aligning System 1 and System 2 thinking,\nthereby supporting the development of diverse abstraction methodologies.",

We explore this challenge in the traditional offline RL setting,\nwhere an agent must learn how to make decisions based on data collected through\na stochastic behavior policy. We present Latent Macro Action Planner (L-MAP),\nwhich addresses this challenge by learning a set of temporally extended\nmacro-actions through a state-conditional Vector Quantized Variational\nAutoencoder (VQ-VAE), effectively reducing action dimensionality. L-MAP employs\na (separate) learned prior model that acts as a latent transition model and\nallows efficient sampling of plausible actions. During planning, our approach\naccounts for stochasticity in both the environment and the behavior policy by\nusing Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). In offline RL settings, including\nstochastic continuous control tasks, L-MAP efficiently searches over discrete\nlatent actions to yield high expected returns. Empirical results demonstrate\nthat L-MAP maintains low decision latency despite increased action\ndimensionality. Notably, across tasks ranging from continuous control with\ninherently stochastic dynamics to high-dimensional robotic hand manipulation,\nL-MAP significantly outperforms existing model-based methods and performs\non-par with strong model-free actor-critic baselines, highlighting the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach in planning in complex and stochastic\nenvironments with high-dimensional action spaces.",

Moving to sulfur adatom overlayers on Cu(111),\nAg(111), and Au(111) the CHGNet model, however, requires corrections.

To apply CP, the conformal threshold was selected based on the\ninternal/external calibration nonconformity score, and CP was subsequently\napplied to the internal/external test sets, with coverage reported for all. We\ndefined the uncertainty ratio (UR) and assessed its correlation with the Dice\nscore coefficient (DSC).

    "abstract": "The fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect was recently discovered\nin twisted MoTe2 bilayers (tMoTe2). Experiments to date have revealed Chern\ninsulators from hole doping at v = -1, -2/3, -3/5, and -4/7 (per moir\\'e unit\ncell). In parallel, theories predict that, between v = -1 and -3, there exist\nexotic quantum phases, such as the coveted fractional topological insulators\n(FTI), fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) states, and non-abelian fractional\nstates. Here we employ transient optical spectroscopy on tMoTe2 to reveal\nnearly 20 hidden states at fractional fillings that are absent in static\noptical sensing or transport measurements. A pump pulse selectively excites\ncharge across the correlated or pseudo gaps, leading to the disordering\n(melting) of correlated states. A probe pulse detects the subsequent melting\nand recovery dynamics via exciton and trion sensing. Besides the known states,\nwe observe additional fractional fillings between v = 0 and -1 and a large\nnumber of states on the electron doping side (v > 0). Most importantly, we\nobserve new states at fractional fillings of the Chern bands at v = -4/3, -3/2,\n-5/3, -7/3, -5/2, and -8/3. These states are potential candidates for the\npredicted exotic topological phases. Moreover, we show that melting of\ncorrelated states occurs on two distinct time scales, 2-4 ps and 180-270 ps,\nattributed to electronic and phonon mechanisms, respectively. We discuss the\ndiffering dynamics of the electron and hole doped states from the distinct\nmoir\\'e conduction and valence bands.",

Global Workspace (GW)\nTheory offers a cognitive framework for multimodal integration and information\nbroadcasting in the brain, and recent studies have begun to introduce efficient\ndeep learning implementations of GW. Here, we evaluate the capabilities of an\nRL system combining GW with a world model. We compare our GW-Dreamer with\nvarious versions of the standard PPO and the original Dreamer algorithms. We\nshow that performing the dreaming process (i.e., mental simulation) inside the\nGW latent space allows for training with fewer environment steps.

To address this issue, we introduce the\nconcept of dynamically enhancing a basic driving planner with local driving\ndata, without permanently modifying the planner itself. This approach, termed\nthe Dynamically Local-Enhancement (DLE) Planner, aims to improve the\nscalability of autonomous driving systems without significantly expanding the\nplanner's size.

We evaluated\nour approach in multiple scenarios and compared it with a one-for-all driving\nmodel. The results show that our method outperforms the baseline policy in both\nsafety (collision rate) and average reward, while maintaining a lighter scale.\nThis approach has the potential to benefit large-scale autonomous vehicles\nwithout the need for largely expanding on-device driving models.",

    "abstract": "The challenging applications envisioned for the future Internet of Things\nnetworks are making it urgent to develop fast and scalable resource allocation\nalgorithms able to meet the stringent reliability and latency constraints\ntypical of the Ultra Reliable, Low Latency Communications (URLLC).\n  However, there is an inherent tradeoff between complexity and performance to\nbe addressed: sophisticated resource allocation methods providing optimized\nspectrum utilization are challenged by the scale of applications and the\nconcomitant stringent latency constraints. Whether non-trivial resource\nallocation approaches can be successfully applied in large-scale network\ninstances is still an open question that this paper aims to address. More\nspecifically, we consider a scenario in which Channel State Information (CSI)\nis used to improve spectrum allocation in a radio environment that experiences\nchannel time correlation.\n  Channel correlation allows the usage of CSI for longer time before an update,\nthus lowering the overhead burden. Following this intuition, we propose a\ndynamic pilot transmission allocation scheme in order to adaptively tune the\nCSI age.\n  We systematically analyze the improvement of this approach applied to a\nsophisticated, recently introduced graph-based resource allocation method that\nwe extend here to account for CSI.\n  The results show that, even in very dense networks and accounting for the\nhigher computational time of the graph-based approach, this algorithm is able\nto improve spectrum efficiency by over 12% as compared to a greedy heuristic,\nand that dynamic pilot transmissions allocation can further boost its\nperformance in terms of fairness, while concomitantly further increase spectrum\nefficiency of 3-5%. \\",

    "abstract": "Event cameras, with a high dynamic range exceeding $120dB$, significantly\noutperform traditional embedded cameras, robustly recording detailed changing\ninformation under various lighting conditions, including both low- and\nhigh-light situations. However, recent research on utilizing event data has\nprimarily focused on low-light image enhancement, neglecting image enhancement\nand brightness adjustment across a broader range of lighting conditions, such\nas normal or high illumination. Based on this, we propose a novel research\nquestion: how to employ events to enhance and adaptively adjust the brightness\nof images captured under broad lighting conditions? To investigate this\nquestion, we first collected a new dataset, SEE-600K, consisting of 610,126\nimages and corresponding events across 202 scenarios, each featuring an average\nof four lighting conditions with over a 1000-fold variation in illumination.\nSubsequently, we propose a framework that effectively utilizes events to\nsmoothly adjust image brightness through the use of prompts. Our framework\ncaptures color through sensor patterns, uses cross-attention to model events as\na brightness dictionary, and adjusts the image's dynamic range to form a broad\nlight-range representation (BLR), which is then decoded at the pixel level\nbased on the brightness prompt. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nmethod not only performs well on the low-light enhancement dataset but also\nshows robust performance on broader light-range image enhancement using the\nSEE-600K dataset. Additionally, our approach enables pixel-level brightness\nadjustment, providing flexibility for post-processing and inspiring more\nimaging applications.

Accurately quantifying this obscuration is crucial for interpreting\ngalaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The extinction curves in the Milky\nWay (MW) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) exhibit a strong feature known as the\n2175A UV bump, most often attributed to small carbonaceous dust grains. This\nfeature was recently detected in faint galaxies out to z~7 suggesting rapid\nformation channels. Here we report the detection of a strong UV bump in a\nluminous Lyman-break galaxy at z = 7.11235, GNWY-7379420231, through\nobservations taken as part of the NIRSpec Wide GTO survey. We fit a dust\nattenuation curve that is consistent with the MW extinction curve within\n1{\\sigma}, in a galaxy just ~700 Myr after the Big Bang. From the integrated\nspectrum, we infer a young mass-weighted age (t* ~ 22-59 Myr) for this galaxy,\nhowever spatially resolved SED fitting unveils the presence of an older stellar\npopulation (t* ~ 252 Myr). Furthermore, morphological analysis provides\nevidence for a potential merger. The underlying older stellar population\nsuggests the merging system could be pre-enriched, with the dust illuminated by\na merger-induced starburst. Moreover, turbulence driven by stellar feedback in\nthis bursty region may be driving PAH formation through top-down shattering.\nThe presence of a UV bump in GNWY-7379420231 solidifies growing evidence for\nthe rapid evolution of dust properties within the first billion years of cosmic\ntime.",

To address these limitations, this paper presents a\ncomprehensive approach that advances both data curation and model design. We\nintroduce CFC-VIDS-1M, a high-quality video dataset constructed through a\nsystematic coarse-to-fine curation pipeline. The pipeline first evaluates video\nquality across multiple dimensions, followed by a fine-grained stage that\nleverages vision-language models to enhance text-video alignment and semantic\nrichness. Building upon the curated dataset's emphasis on visual quality and\ntemporal coherence, we develop RACCOON, a transformer-based architecture with\ndecoupled spatial-temporal attention mechanisms. The model is trained through a\nprogressive four-stage strategy designed to efficiently handle the complexities\nof video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our integrated\napproach of high-quality data curation and efficient training strategy\ngenerates visually appealing and temporally coherent videos while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency.

    "abstract": "Forecasting violent rockbursts remains a formidable challenge due to\nsignificant uncertainties involved. One major uncertainty arises from the\nintermittency of rock failure processes, typically characterised by a series of\nprogressively shorter quiescent phases punctuated by sudden accelerations,\nrather than a smooth continuous progression towards the final breakdown. This\nnon-monotonic evolution of rock mass deformation complicates rockburst\nprediction, challenging conventional time-to-failure models that often assume a\nsmooth power law accelerating behaviour. Here, we introduce a generalised\ntime-to-failure model called log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) model\nto effectively capture the intermittent dynamics of damage and rupture\nprocesses in rock leading up to violent rockbursts. We perform parametric and\nnonparametric tests on 11 historical rockburst events at three underground\nmines, documenting empirical evidence and providing theoretical arguments to\ndemonstrate the significance of log-periodic oscillatory power law finite-time\nsingularities. Log-periodicity in these rockburst events is likely driven by\nthe interaction of subparallel propagating cracks, the diffusion of\nstress-triggering processes, or the interplay between stress drop and stress\ncorrosion. Our results and insights obtained have significant implications for\nnot only understanding but also forecasting rockbursts, as recognising and\ncharacterising log-periodicity can help transform intermittency from\ntraditionally perceived noise into valuable predictive information.",

The resulting normal forms provide an approximation to the\noriginal FPUT lattice that possesses a significant number of exact quadratic\nconservation laws, beyond the quadratic part of the Hamiltonian. We call the\nnew equations \"exact-resonance evolution equations\" and examine their\nproperties: (i) Heisenberg representation's slow evolution allows us to\nimplement numerical methods with large time steps to obtain relevant dynamical\ninformation, such as Lyapunov exponents. (ii) We introduce tests, such as\nconvergence of the normal form transformation and truncation error\nverification, to successfully validate our exact-resonance evolution equations.\n(iii) The systematic construction of new quadratic invariants (via the resonant\ncluster matrix) allows us to use finite-time Lyapunov exponent calculations to\nquantify the level of nonlinearity at which the original FPUT lattice is well\napproximated by the exact-resonance evolution equations. We show numerical\nexperiments in the case $N=9$, but the theory and numerical methods are valid\nfor arbitrary values of $N$.

    "abstract": "Cosmic-ray detection with radio antennas has traditionally depended on\nexternal triggers from particle detectors, constraining sensitivity and\nincreasing complexity. Previous attempts at fully standalone, radio-only\ntriggers have often failed under intense radio frequency interference, making\ngenuine air-shower signals difficult to isolate. We present a\nproof-of-principle artificial intelligence-based self-triggering system that\novercomes these limitations. By training a deep learning model on both real\nnoise data and injected cosmic-ray-like pulses, we achieve an exceptionally low\nfalse-positive rate alongside high detection efficiency. Configurable operating\npoints can suppress false positives below 0.01\\% while retaining more than 88\\%\nof genuine signals, and can even eliminate false positives entirely at a modest\nreduction in signal efficiency. This flexibility makes single-station\ncosmic-ray detection feasible without requiring external trigger inputs.\nApplying our approach to real-world noise conditions reduces the initial\nfalse-positive event rate by several orders of magnitude, supporting\nlarge-scale deployments. Extrapolation to dedicated hardware implementations,\nsuch as FPGAs, indicates that sub-\\SI{}{\\micro\\second} inference times are\nachievable, enabling real-time autonomous triggering.

There are two main\napproaches to constructing SNNs. Direct training methods require much memory,\nwhile conversion methods offer a simpler and more efficient option. However,\ncurrent conversion methods mainly focus on converting convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) to SNNs. Converting Transformers to SNN is challenging because\nof the presence of non-linear modules. In this paper, we propose an Expectation\nCompensation Module to preserve the accuracy of the conversion. The core idea\nis to use information from the previous T time-steps to calculate the expected\noutput at time-step T.

This\nis based on our observation that sparse characteristics of DiTs exhibit\nhierarchical and blockified structures between and within different modalities.\nThis blockified approach significantly reduces the complexity of attention\ncomputation while maintaining high fidelity in the generated videos. Secondly,\nto enable Online Precise Search, we propose the Fused LSE-Cached Search with\nHead-adaptive Hierarchical Block Sparse Attention. This method is motivated by\nour finding that DiTs' sparse pattern and LSE vary w.r.t. inputs, layers, and\nheads, but remain invariant across denoising steps. By leveraging this\ninvariance across denoising steps, it adapts to the dynamic nature of DiTs and\nallows for precise, real-time identification of sparse indices with minimal\noverhead.

Although most LVLMs have\nundergone safety alignment, recent research shows that the visual modality is\nstill vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In our work, we discover that by using\nflowcharts with partially harmful information, LVLMs can be induced to provide\nadditional harmful details. Based on this, we propose a jailbreak attack method\nbased on auto-generated flowcharts, FC-Attack. Specifically, FC-Attack first\nfine-tunes a pre-trained LLM to create a step-description generator based on\nbenign datasets. The generator is then used to produce step descriptions\ncorresponding to a harmful query, which are transformed into flowcharts in 3\ndifferent shapes (vertical, horizontal, and S-shaped) as visual prompts. These\nflowcharts are then combined with a benign textual prompt to execute a\njailbreak attack on LVLMs. Our evaluations using the Advbench dataset show that\nFC-Attack achieves over 90% attack success rates on Gemini-1.5, Llaval-Next,\nQwen2-VL, and InternVL-2.5 models, outperforming existing LVLM jailbreak\nmethods.

We tested this hypothesis\nwith two datasets representing cow activity, which typically follows a daily\npattern but can deviate due to specific physiological or pathological\nconditions. We applied features derived from wavelet transform as well as\nstatistical features in an Isolation Forest algorithm. We measured the distance\nof detection between the days annotated abnormal by animal caretakers days and\nthe days predicted abnormal by the algorithm.

As InBrainSyn uses diffeomorphic\ntransformations to simulate aging, the synthesized images are topologically\nconsistent with the original anatomy by design. We evaluated InBrainSyn both\nquantitatively and qualitatively on AD and healthy control cohorts from the\nOpen Access Series of Imaging Studies - version 3 dataset. Experimentally,\nInBrainSyn can also model neuroanatomical transitions between normal aging and\nAD. An evaluation of an external set supports its generalizability. Overall,\nwith only a single baseline scan, InBrainSyn synthesizes realistic 3D\nspatiotemporal T1w MRI scans, producing personalized longitudinal aging\ntrajectories. The code for InBrainSyn is available at:\nhttps://github.com/Fjr9516/InBrainSyn.",

To\naddress this, we propose a novel data-free universal attack approach that\ngenerates a pseudo-semantic prior recursively from the UAPs, enriching semantic\ncontents within the data-free UAP framework. Our method is based on the\nobservation that UAPs inherently contain latent semantic information, enabling\nthe generated UAP to act as an alternative data prior, by capturing a diverse\nrange of semantics through region sampling. We further introduce a sample\nreweighting technique to emphasize hard examples by focusing on samples that\nare less affected by the UAP. By leveraging the semantic information from the\npseudo-semantic prior, we also incorporate input transformations, typically\nineffective in data-free UAPs due to the lack of semantic content in random\npriors, to boost black-box transferability. Comprehensive experiments on\nImageNet show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in average\nfooling rate by a substantial margin, significantly improves attack\ntransferability across various CNN architectures compared to existing data-free\nUAP methods, and even surpasses data-dependent UAP methods.",

To address these limitations, we propose JiTTER (Jigsaw Temporal\nTransformer for Event Reconstruction), an SSL framework designed to enhance\ntemporal modeling in transformer-based SED. JiTTER introduces a hierarchical\ntemporal shuffle reconstruction strategy, where audio sequences are randomly\nshuffled at both the block-level and frame-level, forcing the model to\nreconstruct the correct temporal order. This pretraining objective encourages\nthe model to learn both global event structures and fine-grained transient\ndetails, improving its ability to detect events with sharp onset-offset\ncharacteristics. Additionally, we incorporate noise injection during block\nshuffle, providing a subtle perturbation mechanism that further regularizes\nfeature learning and enhances model robustness. Experimental results on the\nDESED dataset demonstrate that JiTTER outperforms MAT-SED, achieving a 5.89%\nimprovement in PSDS, highlighting the effectiveness of explicit temporal\nreasoning in SSL-based SED.

Here, we\ndevelop a theory of slidetronics based on the notion that sliding-induced\nswitching $P \\rightarrow P'$ can also be achieved by applying an appropriate\npoint-group operator $G$ to the entire system, such that $P' = G P$. Interlayer\nsliding and the transformation induced by the generator $G$ are thus equivalent\nin describing the relationship between the initial and final layer\nconfigurations. From this symmetry principle, we deduce that slidetronics can\nbe classified by generators $G$; the generator $G$ must act as a symmetry\noperator for the constituent layers, while it is not a symmetry operator for\nthe stacked layers as a whole; for a given 2D material, $G$ determines the\ninterlayer sliding required for polarization switching; and sliding-induced\ncomplete polarization inversion is impossible in bilayers but can be realized\nin multilayers (e.g., PdSe$_2$ trilayers). These findings provide a framework\nfor designing 2D ferroelectrics with targeted polarization-switching\nproperties, as demonstrated through case studies of real materials.",

Existing methods primarily combine caption\nmodels and large language models (LLMs) to generate target captions based on\ncomposed queries but face various issues such as incompatibility, visual\ninformation loss, and insufficient reasoning. In this work, we propose CoTMR, a\ntraining-free framework crafted for ZS-CIR with novel Chain-of-thought (CoT)\nand Multi-scale Reasoning.

    "abstract": "Generating realistic synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) holds\ntremendous promise for accelerating healthcare research, facilitating AI model\ndevelopment and enhancing patient privacy. However, existing generative methods\ntypically treat EHRs as flat sequences of discrete medical codes. This approach\noverlooks two critical aspects: the inherent hierarchical organization of\nclinical coding systems and the rich semantic context provided by code\ndescriptions. Consequently, synthetic patient sequences often lack high\nclinical fidelity and have limited utility in downstream clinical tasks. In\nthis paper, we propose the Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer (HiSGT),\na novel framework that leverages both hierarchical and semantic information for\nthe generative process. HiSGT constructs a hierarchical graph to encode\nparent-child and sibling relationships among clinical codes and employs a graph\nneural network to derive hierarchy-aware embeddings. These are then fused with\nsemantic embeddings extracted from a pre-trained clinical language model (e.g.,\nClinicalBERT), enabling the Transformer-based generator to more accurately\nmodel the nuanced clinical patterns inherent in real EHRs. Extensive\nexperiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that HiSGT\nsignificantly improves the statistical alignment of synthetic data with real\npatient records, as well as supports robust downstream applications such as\nchronic disease classification.

    "abstract": "Due to the intensifying impacts of extreme climate changes, drought\nforecasting (DF), which aims to predict droughts from historical meteorological\ndata, has become increasingly critical for monitoring and managing water\nresources. Though drought conditions often exhibit spatial climatic coherence\namong neighboring regions, benchmark deep learning-based DF methods overlook\nthis fact and predict the conditions on a region-by-region basis. Using the\nStandardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), we designed and\ntrained a novel and transformative spatially-aware DF neural network, which\neffectively captures local interactions among neighboring regions, resulting in\nenhanced spatial coherence and prediction accuracy. As DF also requires\nsophisticated temporal analysis, the Mamba network, recognized as the most\naccurate and efficient existing time-sequence modeling, was adopted to extract\ntemporal features from short-term time frames. We also adopted quantum neural\nnetworks (QNN) to entangle the spatial features of different time instances,\nleading to refined spatiotemporal features of seven different meteorological\nvariables for effectively identifying short-term climate fluctuations. In the\nlast stage of our proposed SPEI-driven quantum spatially-aware Mamba network\n(SQUARE-Mamba), the extracted spatiotemporal features of seven different\nmeteorological variables were fused to achieve more accurate DF. Validation\nexperiments across El Ni\\~no, La Ni\\~na, and normal years demonstrated the\nsuperiority of the proposed SQUARE-Mamba, remarkably achieving an average\nimprovement of more than 9.8% in the coefficient of determination index (R^2)\ncompared to baseline methods, thereby illustrating the promising roles of the\ntemporal quantum entanglement and Mamba temporal analysis to achieve more\naccurate DF.",

To test this hypothesis, we introduce a\nnovel local learning rule based on Feedback Alignment that leverages indirect,\nlow-dimensional error feedback to train large networks.

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is vital in fields like weather,\nenergy, and finance. However, despite deep learning advancements, traditional\nTransformer-based models often diminish the effect of crucial inter-variable\nrelationships by singular token embedding and struggle to effectively capture\ncomplex dependencies among variables, especially in datasets with rare or\nextreme events. These events create significant imbalances and lead to high\nskewness, complicating accurate prediction efforts. This study introduces\nPFformer, a position-free Transformer-based model designed for single-target\nMTS forecasting, specifically for challenging datasets characterized by extreme\nvariability. PFformer integrates two novel embedding strategies: Enhanced\nFeature-based Embedding (EFE) and Auto-Encoder-based Embedding (AEE). EFE\neffectively encodes inter-variable dependencies by mapping related sequence\nsubsets to high-dimensional spaces without positional constraints, enhancing\nthe encoder's functionality. PFformer shows superior forecasting accuracy\nwithout the traditional limitations of positional encoding in MTS modeling. We\nevaluated PFformer across four challenging datasets, focusing on two key\nforecasting scenarios: long sequence prediction for 3 days ahead and rolling\npredictions every four hours to reflect real-time decision-making processes in\nwater management. PFformer demonstrated remarkable improvements, from 20% to\n60%, compared with state-of-the-art models.",

To achieve this, previous works have used\nGaussian processes (GPs) to perform uncertainty calibration for the attention\nunits of transformers and attained notable successes. However, such approaches\nhave to confine the transformers to the space of symmetric attention to ensure\nthe necessary symmetric requirement of their GP's kernel specification, which\nreduces the representation capacity of the model.

    "abstract": "UV-Vis spectroscopy is a workhorse in analytical chemistry that finds\napplication in life science, organic synthesis and energy technologies like\nphotocatalysis. In its traditional implementation with cuvettes, it requires\nsample volumes in the milliliter range. Here, we show how Nanofluidic\nScattering Spectroscopy, NSS, which measures visible light scattered from a\nsingle nanochannel in a spectrally resolved way, can reduce this sample volume\nto the attoliter range for solute concentrations in the mM regime, which\ncorresponds to as few as 105 probed molecules. The connection of the\nnanochannel to a microfluidic in-and outlet system enables such measurements in\ncontinuous flow conditions, and the integrated online optical reference system\nensures their long-term stability. On the examples of the non-absorbing solutes\nNaCl and H2O2, and the dyes Brilliant Blue, Allura Red and Fluorescein, we\ndemonstrate that spectral fingerprints can be obtained with good accuracy and\nthat solute concentrations inside the nanochannel can be determined based on\nNSS-spectra. Furthermore, by applying a reverse Kramers-Kronig transformation\nto NSS-spectra, we show that the molar extinction coefficient of the dye\nsolutes can be extracted with excellent agreement with the literature values.\nThese results thus advertise NSS as a versatile tool for the spectroscopic\nanalysis of solutes in situations where nanoscopic sample volumes, as well as\ncontinuous flow measurements, are critical, e.g., in single particle catalysis\nor nanoscale flow cytometry.",

But what those\nnetworks can learn depends upon their inductive biases -- the factors other\nthan the data that influence the solutions they discover -- and the inductive\nbiases of neural networks remain poorly understood, limiting our ability to\ndraw conclusions about human learning from the performance of these systems.\nCognitive scientists and machine learning researchers often focus on the\narchitecture of a neural network as a source of inductive bias. In this paper\nwe explore the impact of another source of inductive bias -- the initial\nweights of the network -- using meta-learning as a tool for finding initial\nweights that are adapted for specific problems. We evaluate four widely-used\narchitectures -- MLPs, CNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers -- by meta-training 430\ndifferent models across three tasks requiring different biases and forms of\ngeneralization. We find that meta-learning can substantially reduce or entirely\neliminate performance differences across architectures and data\nrepresentations, suggesting that these factors may be less important as sources\nof inductive bias than is typically assumed. When differences are present,\narchitectures and data representations that perform well without meta-learning\ntend to meta-train more effectively. Moreover, all architectures generalize\npoorly on problems that are far from their meta-training experience,\nunderscoring the need for stronger inductive biases for robust generalization.",

    "abstract": "Multi-view object tracking (MVOT) offers promising solutions to challenges\nsuch as occlusion and target loss, which are common in traditional single-view\ntracking. However, progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive\nmulti-view datasets and effective cross-view integration methods. To overcome\nthese limitations, we compiled a Multi-View object Tracking (MVTrack) dataset\nof 234K high-quality annotated frames featuring 27 distinct objects across\nvarious scenes. In conjunction with this dataset, we introduce a novel MVOT\nmethod, Multi-View Integration Tracker (MITracker), to efficiently integrate\nmulti-view object features and provide stable tracking outcomes. MITracker can\ntrack any object in video frames of arbitrary length from arbitrary viewpoints.\nThe key advancements of our method over traditional single-view approaches come\nfrom two aspects: (1) MITracker transforms 2D image features into a 3D feature\nvolume and compresses it into a bird's eye view (BEV) plane, facilitating\ninter-view information fusion; (2) we propose an attention mechanism that\nleverages geometric information from fused 3D feature volume to refine the\ntracking results at each view. MITracker outperforms existing methods on the\nMVTrack and GMTD datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "In mixed autonomous driving environments, accurately predicting the future\ntrajectories of surrounding vehicles is crucial for the safe operation of\nautonomous vehicles (AVs). In driving scenarios, a vehicle's trajectory is\ndetermined by the decision-making process of human drivers. However, existing\nmodels primarily focus on the inherent statistical patterns in the data, often\nneglecting the critical aspect of understanding the decision-making processes\nof human drivers. This oversight results in models that fail to capture the\ntrue intentions of human drivers, leading to suboptimal performance in\nlong-term trajectory prediction. To address this limitation, we introduce a\nCognitive-Informed Transformer (CITF) that incorporates a cognitive concept,\nPerceived Safety, to interpret drivers' decision-making mechanisms. Perceived\nSafety encapsulates the varying risk tolerances across drivers with different\ndriving behaviors. Specifically, we develop a Perceived Safety-aware Module\nthat includes a Quantitative Safety Assessment for measuring the subject risk\nlevels within scenarios, and Driver Behavior Profiling for characterizing\ndriver behaviors. Furthermore, we present a novel module, Leanformer, designed\nto capture social interactions among vehicles. CITF demonstrates significant\nperformance improvements on three well-established datasets. In terms of\nlong-term prediction, it surpasses existing benchmarks by 12.0% on the NGSIM,\n28.2% on the HighD, and 20.8% on the MoCAD dataset.

Despite the current pessimistic\nlandscape of results, we make significant progress in pushing the trade-off\nbetween fidelity and memorization. We first provide theoretical evidence that\nmemorization in diffusion models is only necessary for denoising problems at\nlow noise scales (usually used in generating high-frequency details). Using\nthis theoretical insight, we propose a simple, principled method to train the\ndiffusion models using noisy data at large noise scales. We show that our\nmethod significantly reduces memorization without decreasing the image quality,\nfor both text-conditional and unconditional models and for a variety of data\navailability settings.",

    "abstract": "Boosting has emerged as a useful machine learning technique over the past\nthree decades, attracting increased attention. Most advancements in this area,\nhowever, have primarily focused on numerical implementation procedures, often\nlacking rigorous theoretical justifications. Moreover, these approaches are\ngenerally designed for datasets with fully observed data, and their validity\ncan be compromised by the presence of missing observations. In this paper, we\nemploy semiparametric estimation approaches to develop boosting prediction\nmethods for data with missing responses. We explore two strategies for\nadjusting the loss functions to account for missingness effects. The proposed\nmethods are implemented using a functional gradient descent algorithm, and\ntheir theoretical properties, including algorithm convergence and estimator\nconsistency, are rigorously established. Numerical studies demonstrate that the\nproposed methods perform well in finite sample settings.",

However, open questions remain about their clinical\napplicability and generalization advantages over end-to-end learning using\ntask-specific (TS) models. Here, we focused on AI with clinical-grade\nperformance for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading. We present the\nlargest validation of AI for this task, using over 100,000 core needle biopsies\nfrom 7,342 patients across 15 sites in 11 countries. We compared two FMs with a\nfully end-to-end TS model in a multiple instance learning framework. Our\nfindings challenge assumptions that FMs universally outperform TS models. While\nFMs demonstrated utility in data-scarce scenarios, their performance converged\nwith - and was in some cases surpassed by - TS models when sufficient labeled\ntraining data were available. Notably, extensive task-specific training\nmarkedly reduced clinically significant misgrading, misdiagnosis of challenging\nmorphologies, and variability across different WSI scanners. Additionally, FMs\nused up to 35 times more energy than the TS model, raising concerns about their\nsustainability. Our results underscore that while FMs offer clear advantages\nfor rapid prototyping and research, their role as a universal solution for\nclinically applicable medical AI remains uncertain. For high-stakes clinical\napplications, rigorous validation and consideration of task-specific training\nremain critically important.

The long-lasting\nmonitoring of a number of stars of this type with the Nordic Optical Telescope\nfrom 2019 to 2024 has given a rich collection of material of high-resolution (R\n~ 25000) spectra obtained during different brightness states of the stars. In\nthis paper, we present the results of observations for UX Ori itself. Until now\nonly one spectrum of high resolution had been obtained for this star during\nbrightness minimum, making it difficult to do a comprehensive analysis. Our aim\nis to analyse how different spectral lines change during such irregular fading\nevents, when the star is going in and out of eclipses, obscured by dust along\nthe line of sight. For this purpose we provide a comparative analysis of the\nprofiles and equivalent widths of the spectral lines belonging to the different\natoms and ions. In addition we compare the results for UX Ori with those made\nfor another target in our sample: RR Tau. Common features of variability are\nrevealed: 1) a strengthening of the H-alpha line relatively to the continuum\nduring eclipses; 2) the appearance of additional emission on the frequencies of\nphotospheric lines (e.g. Fe II, Ca II, Si II). The different behaviour of the\nspectral lines during fading found for UX Ori and RR Tau may be caused by two\neffects: a different contribution of the scattered light to the stellar flux\nduring eclipses or a less intense disc wind of UX Ori.",

Data Parallelism) and intra-data\npartitioning (a.k.a. Context Parallelism) are commonly used. Current training\nframeworks predominantly treat the two techniques as orthogonal, and establish\nstatic communication groups to organize the devices as a static mesh (e.g., a\n2D mesh). However, the sequences for LLM training typically vary in lengths, no\nmatter for texts, multi-modalities or reinforcement learning. The mismatch\nbetween data heterogeneity and static mesh causes redundant communication and\nimbalanced computation, degrading the training efficiency.\n  In this work, we introduce ByteScale, an efficient, flexible, and scalable\nLLM training framework for large-scale mixed training of long and short\nsequences. The core of ByteScale is a novel parallelism strategy, namely Hybrid\nData Parallelism (HDP), which unifies the inter- and intra-data partitioning\nwith a dynamic mesh design. In particular, we build a communication optimizer,\nwhich eliminates the redundant communication for short sequences by data-aware\nsharding and dynamic communication, and further compresses the communication\ncost for long sequences by selective offloading. Besides, we also develop a\nbalance scheduler to mitigate the imbalanced computation by parallelism-aware\ndata assignment.

This work is motivated\nby the requirement in constrained random verification (CRV) to generate input\nstimuli to validate the functionality of digital hardware circuits. A major\nchallenge in CRV is generating inputs for sequential circuits, along with the\nappropriate number of clock cycles required to meet design constraints.\nTraditional approaches often use Boolean satisfiability (SAT) samplers to\ngenerate inputs by unrolling state transitions over a fixed number of clock\ncycles. However, these methods do not guarantee that a solution exists for the\ngiven number of cycles. Consequently, producing input stimuli together with the\nrequired clock cycles is essential for thorough testing and verification. Our\napproach converts the logical constraints and temporal behavior of sequential\ncircuits into a recurrent CircuitSAT problem, optimized via gradient descent to\nefficiently explore a diverse set of valid solutions, including their\nassociated number of clock cycles. By operating directly on the circuit\nstructure, our method reinterprets the sampling process as a supervised\nmulti-output regression task. This differentiable framework enables independent\nelement-wise operations on each tensor element, facilitating parallel execution\nduring learning. As a result, we achieve GPU-accelerated sampling with\nsubstantial runtime improvements (up to 105.1x) over state-of-the-art heuristic\nsamplers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive\nevaluations on circuit problems from the ISCAS-89 and ITC'99 benchmark suites.",

In our work, we discover that by using\nflowcharts with partially harmful information, LVLMs can be induced to provide\nadditional harmful details. Based on this, we propose a jailbreak attack method\nbased on auto-generated flowcharts, FC-Attack. Specifically, FC-Attack first\nfine-tunes a pre-trained LLM to create a step-description generator based on\nbenign datasets. The generator is then used to produce step descriptions\ncorresponding to a harmful query, which are transformed into flowcharts in 3\ndifferent shapes (vertical, horizontal, and S-shaped) as visual prompts. These\nflowcharts are then combined with a benign textual prompt to execute a\njailbreak attack on LVLMs. Our evaluations using the Advbench dataset show that\nFC-Attack achieves over 90% attack success rates on Gemini-1.5, Llaval-Next,\nQwen2-VL, and InternVL-2.5 models, outperforming existing LVLM jailbreak\nmethods. Additionally, we investigate factors affecting the attack performance,\nincluding the number of steps and the font styles in the flowcharts. Our\nevaluation shows that FC-Attack can improve the jailbreak performance from 4%\nto 28% in Claude-3.5 by changing the font style. To mitigate the attack, we\nexplore several defenses and find that AdaShield can largely reduce the\njailbreak performance but with the cost of utility drop.",

    "abstract": "Practical control systems pose significant challenges in identifying optimal\ncontrol policies due to uncertainties in the system model and external\ndisturbances. While $H_\\infty$ control techniques are commonly used to design\nrobust controllers that mitigate the effects of disturbances, these methods\noften require complex and computationally intensive calculations. To address\nthis issue, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning algorithm called\nRobust Deterministic Policy Gradient (RDPG), which formulates the $H_\\infty$\ncontrol problem as a two-player zero-sum dynamic game. In this formulation, one\nplayer (the user) aims to minimize the cost, while the other player (the\nadversary) seeks to maximize it. We then employ deterministic policy gradient\n(DPG) and its deep reinforcement learning counterpart to train a robust control\npolicy with effective disturbance attenuation. In particular, for practical\nimplementation, we introduce an algorithm called robust deep deterministic\npolicy gradient (RDDPG), which employs a deep neural network architecture and\nintegrates techniques from the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient\n(TD3) to enhance stability and learning efficiency. To evaluate the proposed\nalgorithm, we implement it on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tasked with\nfollowing a predefined path in a disturbance-prone environment. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other\ncontrol approaches in terms of robustness against disturbances, enabling\nprecise real-time tracking of moving targets even under severe disturbance\nconditions.",

Here we aim at detecting anomalies in 24h time\nseries of cow activity, with a view to detect cases of disease or oestrus.\nDeviations must be distinguished from noise which can be very high in case of\nbiological data. It is also important to detect the anomaly early, e.g. before\na farmer would notice it visually. Here, we investigate the benefit of using\nwavelet transforms to denoise data and we assess the performance of an anomaly\ndetection algorithm considering the timing of the detection. We developed\nfeatures based on the comparisons between the wavelet transforms of the mean of\nthe time series and the wavelet transforms of individual time series instances.\nWe hypothesized that these features contribute to the detection of anomalies in\nperiodic time series using a feature-based algorithm. We tested this hypothesis\nwith two datasets representing cow activity, which typically follows a daily\npattern but can deviate due to specific physiological or pathological\nconditions. We applied features derived from wavelet transform as well as\nstatistical features in an Isolation Forest algorithm. We measured the distance\nof detection between the days annotated abnormal by animal caretakers days and\nthe days predicted abnormal by the algorithm. The results show that\nwavelet-based features are among the features most contributing to anomaly\ndetection. They also show that detections are close to the annotated days, and\noften precede it.

Specifically, we leverage clustering techniques to\nidentify a dominant cluster in the target feature space. Posed as the normal\ncluster, the latter is aligned with the source normal features. Concretely,\ngiven a one-class source set and an unlabeled target set composed mostly of\nnormal data and some anomalies, we fit the source features within a hypersphere\nwhile jointly aligning them with the features of the dominant cluster from the\ntarget set. The paper provides extensive experiments and analysis on common\nadaptation benchmarks for anomaly detection, demonstrating the relevance of\nboth the newly introduced paradigm and the proposed approach.

The limited class diversity inherent to\none-class classification tasks, combined with distribution biases caused by\nvariations in products across and within clients, poses significant challenges\nfor preserving data privacy with federated UAD. Thus, this article proposes an\nefficient federated learning method with dynamic memory and memory-reduce for\nunsupervised image anomaly detection, called FedDyMem. Considering all client\ndata belongs to a single class (i.e., normal sample) in UAD and the\ndistribution of intra-class features demonstrates significant skewness,\nFedDyMem facilitates knowledge sharing between the client and server through\nthe client's dynamic memory bank instead of model parameters. In the local\nclients, a memory generator and a metric loss are employed to improve the\nconsistency of the feature distribution for normal samples, leveraging the\nlocal model to update the memory bank dynamically. For efficient communication,\na memory-reduce method based on weighted averages is proposed to significantly\ndecrease the scale of memory banks. On the server, global memory is constructed\nand distributed to individual clients through k-means aggregation. Experiments\nconducted on six industrial and medical datasets, comprising a mixture of six\nproducts or health screening types derived from eleven public datasets,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of FedDyMem.",

Current wireless\nnetworks are designed to perform adequately across multiple scenarios so they\nlack the adaptability needed for specific use cases. Therefore, meeting the\nstringent requirements of next-generation applications incorporating technology\nadvances and operating in novel scenarios will necessitate wireless specialized\nnetworks which we refer to as SpecNets. These networks, equipped with cognitive\ncapabilities, dynamically adapt to the unique demands of each application,\ne.g., by automatically selecting and configuring network mechanisms. An enabler\nof SpecNets are the recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning (AI/ML), which allow to continuously learn and react to changing\nrequirements and scenarios. By integrating AI/ML functionalities, SpecNets will\nfully leverage the concept of AI/ML-defined radios (MLDRs) that are able to\nautonomously establish their own communication protocols by acquiring\ncontextual information and dynamically adapting to it. In this paper, we\nintroduce SpecNets and explain how MLDR interfaces enable this concept. We\npresent three illustrative use cases for wireless local area networks (WLANs):\nbespoke industrial networks, traffic-aware robust THz links, and coexisting\nnetworks. Finally, we showcase SpecNets' benefits in the industrial use case by\nintroducing a lightweight, fast-converging ML agent based on multi-armed\nbandits (MABs).

A similar trend can also be seen in\nTurkey, while another similarity is the high dependence on imports for the\ncontinuous NG supply. It is crucial to accurately forecast future NG demand\n(NGD) in Turkey, especially, for import contracts; in this respect, forecasts\nof monthly NGD for the following year are of utmost importance. In the current\nstudy, the historical monthly NG consumption data between 2014 and 2024\nprovided by SOCAR, the local residential NG distribution company for two cities\nin Turkey, Bursa and Kayseri, was used to determine out-of-sample monthly NGD\nforecasts for a period of one year and nine months using various time series\nmodels, including SARIMA and ETS models, and a novel proposed machine learning\nmethod. The proposed method, named Just-in-Time-Learning-Gaussian Process\nRegression (JITL-GPR), uses a novel feature representation for the past NG\ndemand values; instead of using past demand values as column-wise separate\nfeatures, they are placed on a two-dimensional (2-D) grid of year-month values.\nFor each test point, a kernel function, tailored for the NGD predictions, is\nused in GPR to predict the query point. Since a model is constructed separately\nfor each test point, the proposed method is, indeed, an example of JITL. The\nJITL-GPR method is easy to use and optimize, and offers a reduction in forecast\nerrors compared to traditional time series methods and a state-of-the-art\ncombination model; therefore, it is a promising tool for NGD forecasting in\nsimilar settings.",

    "abstract": "Serverless computing has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for deploying Deep\nLearning (DL) models, offering automatic scaling and cost efficiency. However,\nthe inherent cold start problem in serverless ML inference systems,\nparticularly the time-consuming model loading process, remains a significant\nbottleneck. Utilizing pipelined model loading improves efficiency but still\nsuffer from pipeline stalls due to sequential layer construction and monolithic\nweight loading. In this paper, we propose \\textit{Cicada}, a novel pipeline\noptimization framework that coordinates computational, storage, and scheduling\nresources through three key mechanisms: (1) \\textit{MiniLoader}: which reduces\nlayer construction overhead by opportunistically optimizing parameter\ninitialization; (2) \\textit{WeightDecoupler}: decoupling weight file processing\nfrom layer construction, enabling asynchronous weight retrieval and\nout-of-order weight application; (3) \\textit{Priority-Aware Scheduler}:\ndynamically allocating resources to ensure high-priority inference tasks are\nexecuted promptly. Our experimental results demonstrate that Cicada achieves\nsignificant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art PISeL framework.\nSpecifically, Cicada reduces end-to-end inference latency by an average of\n61.59\\%, with the MiniLoader component contributing the majority of this\noptimization (53.41\\%), and the WeightDecoupler achieves up to 26.17\\%\nimprovement.

In this framework, we first design a\nsemantic encoder that effectively identify the keyframes from video and extract\nthe relevant semantic information (SI) to reduce the transmission data size. We\nthen develop a semantic decoder to reconstruct the keyframes from the received\nSI and further generate the full video from the reconstructed keyframes using\nframe interpolation to ensure high-quality reconstruction.

This research investigates the novel\napplication of specialized quantum light emitters introduced into intact leaves\nof tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), a well-characterized model plant system for\nstudies of plant health and productivity. Leaves were harvested from plants\ncultivated under two distinct conditions: low light (LL), representing\nunhealthy leaves with reduced photosynthesis. and high light (HL), representing\nhealthy leaves with highly active photosynthesis. Higher-order correlation data\nwere collected and analyzed using machine learning (ML) techniques,\nspecifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to classify the photon\nemitter states. This CNN efficiently identified unique patterns and created\ndistinct fingerprints for Nicotiana leaves grown under LL and HL, demonstrating\nsignificantly different quantum profiles between the two conditions. These\nquantum fingerprints serve as a foundation for a novel unified analysis of\nplant growth parameters associated with different photosynthetic states. By\nemploying CNN, the emitter profiles were able to reproducibly classify the\nleaves as healthy or unhealthy.

However, when the visual input changes from a single\nimage to a long video, the above paradigm encounters difficulty because the\nvast amount of video tokens has significantly exceeded the maximal capacity of\nMLLMs. Therefore, existing video-based MLLMs are mostly established upon\nsampling a small portion of tokens from input data, which can cause key\ninformation to be lost and thus produce incorrect answers. This paper presents\na simple yet effective algorithm named Adaptive Keyframe Sampling (AKS). It\ninserts a plug-and-play module known as keyframe selection, which aims to\nmaximize the useful information with a fixed number of video tokens. We\nformulate keyframe selection as an optimization involving (1) the relevance\nbetween the keyframes and the prompt, and (2) the coverage of the keyframes\nover the video, and present an adaptive algorithm to approximate the best\nsolution.

However, open questions remain about their clinical\napplicability and generalization advantages over end-to-end learning using\ntask-specific (TS) models. Here, we focused on AI with clinical-grade\nperformance for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading. We present the\nlargest validation of AI for this task, using over 100,000 core needle biopsies\nfrom 7,342 patients across 15 sites in 11 countries. We compared two FMs with a\nfully end-to-end TS model in a multiple instance learning framework. Our\nfindings challenge assumptions that FMs universally outperform TS models. While\nFMs demonstrated utility in data-scarce scenarios, their performance converged\nwith - and was in some cases surpassed by - TS models when sufficient labeled\ntraining data were available. Notably, extensive task-specific training\nmarkedly reduced clinically significant misgrading, misdiagnosis of challenging\nmorphologies, and variability across different WSI scanners. Additionally, FMs\nused up to 35 times more energy than the TS model, raising concerns about their\nsustainability. Our results underscore that while FMs offer clear advantages\nfor rapid prototyping and research, their role as a universal solution for\nclinically applicable medical AI remains uncertain. For high-stakes clinical\napplications, rigorous validation and consideration of task-specific training\nremain critically important.

Two water models are considered: TIP3P which is\nconsistent with the CGenFF energy function and TIP4P which - as a water model -\nis superior to TIP4P. Both fitted models, {\\bf M2$^{\\rm TIP3P}$} and {\\bf\n  M2$^{\\rm TIP4P}$}, yield favourable thermodynamic, structural, spectroscopic\nand transport properties from extensive molecular dynamics simulations. In\nparticular, the slow and fast decay times from 2-dimensional infrared\nspectroscopy and the viscosity for water-rich mixtures are described\nrealistically and consistent with experiments. On the other hand, including the\nco-solvent (acetamide) in the present case is expected to further improve the\ncomputed viscosity for low-water content. It is concluded that such a\ncluster-based approach is a promising and generalizable route for routine\nparametrization of heterogeneous, electrostatically dominated systems.",

    "abstract": "Scaling long-context ability is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs).\nTo amortize the memory consumption across multiple devices in long-context\ntraining, inter-data partitioning (a.k.a. Data Parallelism) and intra-data\npartitioning (a.k.a. Context Parallelism) are commonly used. Current training\nframeworks predominantly treat the two techniques as orthogonal, and establish\nstatic communication groups to organize the devices as a static mesh (e.g., a\n2D mesh). However, the sequences for LLM training typically vary in lengths, no\nmatter for texts, multi-modalities or reinforcement learning. The mismatch\nbetween data heterogeneity and static mesh causes redundant communication and\nimbalanced computation, degrading the training efficiency.\n  In this work, we introduce ByteScale, an efficient, flexible, and scalable\nLLM training framework for large-scale mixed training of long and short\nsequences. The core of ByteScale is a novel parallelism strategy, namely Hybrid\nData Parallelism (HDP), which unifies the inter- and intra-data partitioning\nwith a dynamic mesh design. In particular, we build a communication optimizer,\nwhich eliminates the redundant communication for short sequences by data-aware\nsharding and dynamic communication, and further compresses the communication\ncost for long sequences by selective offloading. Besides, we also develop a\nbalance scheduler to mitigate the imbalanced computation by parallelism-aware\ndata assignment. We evaluate ByteScale with the model sizes ranging from 7B to\n141B, context lengths from 256K to 2048K, on a production cluster with more\nthan 12,000 GPUs. Experiment results show that ByteScale outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art training system by up to 7.89x.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce a novel GPU-accelerated circuit satisfiability\n(CircuitSAT) sampling technique for sequential circuits. This work is motivated\nby the requirement in constrained random verification (CRV) to generate input\nstimuli to validate the functionality of digital hardware circuits. A major\nchallenge in CRV is generating inputs for sequential circuits, along with the\nappropriate number of clock cycles required to meet design constraints.\nTraditional approaches often use Boolean satisfiability (SAT) samplers to\ngenerate inputs by unrolling state transitions over a fixed number of clock\ncycles. However, these methods do not guarantee that a solution exists for the\ngiven number of cycles. Consequently, producing input stimuli together with the\nrequired clock cycles is essential for thorough testing and verification. Our\napproach converts the logical constraints and temporal behavior of sequential\ncircuits into a recurrent CircuitSAT problem, optimized via gradient descent to\nefficiently explore a diverse set of valid solutions, including their\nassociated number of clock cycles. By operating directly on the circuit\nstructure, our method reinterprets the sampling process as a supervised\nmulti-output regression task. This differentiable framework enables independent\nelement-wise operations on each tensor element, facilitating parallel execution\nduring learning. As a result, we achieve GPU-accelerated sampling with\nsubstantial runtime improvements (up to 105.1x) over state-of-the-art heuristic\nsamplers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive\nevaluations on circuit problems from the ISCAS-89 and ITC'99 benchmark suites.",

We systematically\nevaluate the interplay between three critical factors: client count (5, 10,\n15), adversarial training coverage (0-100%), and adversarial attack\nperturbation strength (epsilon = 0.01-0.5), using the MNIST dataset. Our\nexperimental results show that while fewer clients often yield higher\nclean-data accuracy, larger federations can more effectively balance accuracy\nand robustness when partially adversarially trained. Notably, even limited\nadversarial coverage (e.g., 20%-50%) can significantly improve resilience to\nmoderate perturbations, though at the cost of reduced baseline performance.\nConversely, full adversarial training (100%) may regain high clean accuracy but\nis vulnerable under stronger attacks. These findings underscore an inherent\ntrade-off between robust and standard objectives, which is further complicated\nby quantum-specific factors. We conclude that a carefully chosen combination of\nclient count and adversarial coverage is critical for mitigating adversarial\nvulnerabilities in QFL. Moreover, we highlight opportunities for future\nresearch, including adaptive adversarial training schedules, more diverse\nquantum encoding schemes, and personalized defense strategies to further\nenhance the robustness-accuracy trade-off in real-world quantum federated\nenvironments.",

Global Workspace (GW)\nTheory offers a cognitive framework for multimodal integration and information\nbroadcasting in the brain, and recent studies have begun to introduce efficient\ndeep learning implementations of GW.

HDMIL consists of two key components: the\ndynamic multi-instance network (DMIN) and the lightweight instance\npre-screening network (LIPN). DMIN operates on high-resolution WSIs, while LIPN\noperates on the corresponding low-resolution counterparts. During training,\nDMIN are trained for WSI classification while generating attention-score-based\nmasks that indicate irrelevant patches. These masks then guide the training of\nLIPN to predict the relevance of each low-resolution patch. During testing,\nLIPN first determines the useful regions within low-resolution WSIs, which\nindirectly enables us to eliminate irrelevant regions in high-resolution WSIs,\nthereby reducing inference time without causing performance degradation. In\naddition, we further design the first Chebyshev-polynomials-based\nKolmogorov-Arnold classifier in computational pathology, which enhances the\nperformance of HDMIL through learnable activation layers.

Although most LVLMs have\nundergone safety alignment, recent research shows that the visual modality is\nstill vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In our work, we discover that by using\nflowcharts with partially harmful information, LVLMs can be induced to provide\nadditional harmful details.

To address\nthis issue, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning algorithm called\nRobust Deterministic Policy Gradient (RDPG), which formulates the $H_\\infty$\ncontrol problem as a two-player zero-sum dynamic game. In this formulation, one\nplayer (the user) aims to minimize the cost, while the other player (the\nadversary) seeks to maximize it. We then employ deterministic policy gradient\n(DPG) and its deep reinforcement learning counterpart to train a robust control\npolicy with effective disturbance attenuation.

    "abstract": "In Precision Livestock Farming, detecting deviations from optimal or baseline\nvalues - i.e. anomalies in time series - is essential to allow undertaking\ncorrective actions rapidly. Here we aim at detecting anomalies in 24h time\nseries of cow activity, with a view to detect cases of disease or oestrus.\nDeviations must be distinguished from noise which can be very high in case of\nbiological data. It is also important to detect the anomaly early, e.g. before\na farmer would notice it visually. Here, we investigate the benefit of using\nwavelet transforms to denoise data and we assess the performance of an anomaly\ndetection algorithm considering the timing of the detection. We developed\nfeatures based on the comparisons between the wavelet transforms of the mean of\nthe time series and the wavelet transforms of individual time series instances.\nWe hypothesized that these features contribute to the detection of anomalies in\nperiodic time series using a feature-based algorithm. We tested this hypothesis\nwith two datasets representing cow activity, which typically follows a daily\npattern but can deviate due to specific physiological or pathological\nconditions. We applied features derived from wavelet transform as well as\nstatistical features in an Isolation Forest algorithm. We measured the distance\nof detection between the days annotated abnormal by animal caretakers days and\nthe days predicted abnormal by the algorithm. The results show that\nwavelet-based features are among the features most contributing to anomaly\ndetection. They also show that detections are close to the annotated days, and\noften precede it. In conclusion, using wavelet transforms on time series of cow\nactivity data helps to detect anomalies related to specific cow states. The\ndetection is often obtained on days that precede the day annotated by\ncaretakers, which offer possibility to take corrective actions at an early\nstage.",

We evaluated InBrainSyn both\nquantitatively and qualitatively on AD and healthy control cohorts from the\nOpen Access Series of Imaging Studies - version 3 dataset.

Such diverse feedback can better support the goals\nof a human annotator, and the simultaneous use of multiple sources might be\nmutually informative for the learning process or carry type-dependent biases\nfor the reward learning process. Despite these potential benefits, learning\nfrom different feedback types has yet to be explored extensively.

We present a process to generate\nhigh-quality simulated feedback of six different types. Then, we implement\nreward models and downstream RL training for all six feedback types.

    "abstract": "Future wireless networks will need to support diverse applications (such as\nextended reality), scenarios (such as fully automated industries), and\ntechnological advances (such as terahertz communications). Current wireless\nnetworks are designed to perform adequately across multiple scenarios so they\nlack the adaptability needed for specific use cases. Therefore, meeting the\nstringent requirements of next-generation applications incorporating technology\nadvances and operating in novel scenarios will necessitate wireless specialized\nnetworks which we refer to as SpecNets. These networks, equipped with cognitive\ncapabilities, dynamically adapt to the unique demands of each application,\ne.g., by automatically selecting and configuring network mechanisms. An enabler\nof SpecNets are the recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning (AI/ML), which allow to continuously learn and react to changing\nrequirements and scenarios. By integrating AI/ML functionalities, SpecNets will\nfully leverage the concept of AI/ML-defined radios (MLDRs) that are able to\nautonomously establish their own communication protocols by acquiring\ncontextual information and dynamically adapting to it. In this paper, we\nintroduce SpecNets and explain how MLDR interfaces enable this concept. We\npresent three illustrative use cases for wireless local area networks (WLANs):\nbespoke industrial networks, traffic-aware robust THz links, and coexisting\nnetworks. Finally, we showcase SpecNets' benefits in the industrial use case by\nintroducing a lightweight, fast-converging ML agent based on multi-armed\nbandits (MABs). This agent dynamically optimizes channel access to meet varying\nperformance needs: high throughput, low delay, or fair access. Results\ndemonstrate significant gains over IEEE 802.11, highlighting the system's\nautonomous adaptability across diverse scenarios.",

A similar trend can also be seen in\nTurkey, while another similarity is the high dependence on imports for the\ncontinuous NG supply. It is crucial to accurately forecast future NG demand\n(NGD) in Turkey, especially, for import contracts; in this respect, forecasts\nof monthly NGD for the following year are of utmost importance. In the current\nstudy, the historical monthly NG consumption data between 2014 and 2024\nprovided by SOCAR, the local residential NG distribution company for two cities\nin Turkey, Bursa and Kayseri, was used to determine out-of-sample monthly NGD\nforecasts for a period of one year and nine months using various time series\nmodels, including SARIMA and ETS models, and a novel proposed machine learning\nmethod. The proposed method, named Just-in-Time-Learning-Gaussian Process\nRegression (JITL-GPR), uses a novel feature representation for the past NG\ndemand values; instead of using past demand values as column-wise separate\nfeatures, they are placed on a two-dimensional (2-D) grid of year-month values.\nFor each test point, a kernel function, tailored for the NGD predictions, is\nused in GPR to predict the query point. Since a model is constructed separately\nfor each test point, the proposed method is, indeed, an example of JITL. The\nJITL-GPR method is easy to use and optimize, and offers a reduction in forecast\nerrors compared to traditional time series methods and a state-of-the-art\ncombination model; therefore, it is a promising tool for NGD forecasting in\nsimilar settings.",

This study conducts sampling and\nnormalization of the parameters of the LLM to generate visual representations\nand heatmaps of parameter distributions, revealing notable discrepancies in\nparameter distributions among certain layers within the hidden layers. Further\nanalysis involves calculating statistical metrics for each layer, followed by\nthe computation of a Comprehensive Sensitivity Score based on these metrics,\nwhich identifies the lower layers as being particularly sensitive to the\ngeneration of harmful content. Based on this finding, we employ a Freeze\ntraining strategy, selectively performing Supervised Fine-Tuning only on the\nlower layers. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly\nreduces training duration and GPU memory consumption while maintaining a high\njailbreak success rate and a high harm score, outperforming the results\nachieved by applying the LoRA method for SFT across all layers. Additionally,\nthe method has been successfully extended to other open-source large models,\nvalidating its generality and effectiveness across different model\narchitectures. Furthermore, we compare our method with ohter jailbreak method,\ndemonstrating the superior performance of our approach. By innovatively\nproposing a method to statistically analyze and compare large model parameters\nlayer by layer, this study provides new insights into the interpretability of\nlarge models.

To achieve low\nlatency and high-quality video transmission over a bandwidth-constrained noisy\nwireless channel, we propose a stable diffusion (SD)-based goal-oriented\nsemantic communication (GSC) framework. In this framework, we first design a\nsemantic encoder that effectively identify the keyframes from video and extract\nthe relevant semantic information (SI) to reduce the transmission data size. We\nthen develop a semantic decoder to reconstruct the keyframes from the received\nSI and further generate the full video from the reconstructed keyframes using\nframe interpolation to ensure high-quality reconstruction. Recognizing the\nimpact of wireless channel noise on SI transmission, we also propose an\nSD-based denoiser for GSC (SD-GSC) condition on an instantaneous channel gain\nto remove the channel noise from the received noisy SI under a known channel.\nFor scenarios with an unknown channel, we further propose a parallel SD\ndenoiser for GSC (PSD-GSC) to jointly learn the distribution of channel gains\nand denoise the received SI. It is shown that, with the known channel, our\nproposed SD-GSC outperforms state-of-the-art ADJSCC, Latent-Diff DNSC, DeepWiVe\nand DVST, improving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) by 69%, 58%, 33% and 38%,\nreducing mean squared error (MSE) by 52%, 50%, 41% and 45%, and reducing\nFr\\'echet Video Distance (FVD) by 38%, 32%, 22% and 24%, respectively.
