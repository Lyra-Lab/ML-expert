    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the natural language processing\nlandscape and brought to life diverse applications. Pretraining on vast\nweb-scale data has laid the foundation for these models, yet the research\ncommunity is now increasingly shifting focus toward post-training techniques to\nachieve further breakthroughs. While pretraining provides a broad linguistic\nfoundation, post-training methods enable LLMs to refine their knowledge,\nimprove reasoning, enhance factual accuracy, and align more effectively with\nuser intents and ethical considerations. Fine-tuning, reinforcement learning,\nand test-time scaling have emerged as critical strategies for optimizing LLMs\nperformance, ensuring robustness, and improving adaptability across various\nreal-world tasks. This survey provides a systematic exploration of\npost-training methodologies, analyzing their role in refining LLMs beyond\npretraining, addressing key challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, reward\nhacking, and inference-time trade-offs. We highlight emerging directions in\nmodel alignment, scalable adaptation, and inference-time reasoning, and outline\nfuture research directions. We also provide a public repository to continually\ntrack developments in this fast-evolving field:\nhttps://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Awesome-LLM-Post-training.",

    "abstract": "Standard Model (SM) with 15 Weyl fermions per family (lacking the 16th, the\nsterile right-handed neutrino $\\nu_R$) suffers from mixed gauge-gravitational\nanomalies tied to baryon number plus or minus lepton number ${\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf\nL}$ symmetry. Including $\\nu_R$ per family can cancel these anomalies, but when\n${\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf L}$ symmetry is preserved as discrete finite subgroups rather\nthan a continuous U(1), the perturbative local anomalies become nonperturbative\nglobal anomalies. In this work, we systematically enumerate these\ngauge-gravitational global anomalies involving discrete ${\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf L}$\nthat are enhanced from the fermion parity $\\mathbb{Z}_2^{\\rm F}$ to\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\\rm F}$, with $N=2,3,4,6,9$, etc. The ${\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf L}$\ndiscreteness is constrained by multi-fermion deformations beyond-the-SM and the\nfamily number $N_f$. Unlike the free quadratic $\\nu_R$ Majorana mass gap\npreserving the minimal $\\mathbb{Z}_2^{\\rm F}$, we explore novel scenarios\ncanceling $({\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf L})$-gravitational anomalies while preserving the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\\rm F}$ discrete symmetries, featuring 4d interacting gapped\ntopological orders (potentially with or without low-energy TQFT descriptions)\nor gapless sectors (e.g., conformal field theories). We propose anomalous\nsectors as quantum dark matter to cancel SM's global anomalies. We find the\n$N_f=3$ uniqueness, when the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\\rm F}$ representation from the\nfaithful ${\\bf B} + {\\bf L}$ for baryons at $N=N_c=3$ is extended to the\nfaithful ${\\bf Q} + N_c {\\bf L}$ for quarks at $N=N_c N_f=9$, this symmetry\nextension matches with the topological order dark matter construction. Key\nimplications include: (1) a 5th force mediating between SM and dark matter via\ndiscrete gauge fields. (2) dark matter as topological order quantum matter with\ngapped anyon excitations at ends of extended defects. (3) topological\nleptogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Persuasive dialogue plays a pivotal role in human communication, influencing\nvarious domains. Recent persuasive dialogue datasets often fail to align with\nreal-world interpersonal interactions, leading to unfaithful representations.\nFor instance, unrealistic scenarios may arise, such as when the persuadee\nexplicitly instructs the persuader on which persuasion strategies to employ,\nwith each of the persuadee's questions corresponding to a specific strategy for\nthe persuader to follow. This issue can be attributed to a violation of the\n\"Double Blind\" condition, where critical information is fully shared between\nparticipants. In actual human interactions, however, key information such as\nthe mental state of the persuadee and the persuasion strategies of the\npersuader is not directly accessible. The persuader must infer the persuadee's\nmental state using Theory of Mind capabilities and construct arguments that\nalign with the persuadee's motivations. To address this gap, we introduce\nToMMA, a novel multi-agent framework for dialogue generation that is guided by\ncausal Theory of Mind. This framework ensures that information remains\nundisclosed between agents, preserving \"double-blind\" conditions, while causal\nToM directs the persuader's reasoning, enhancing alignment with human-like\npersuasion dynamics. Consequently, we present CToMPersu, a multi-domain,\nmulti-turn persuasive dialogue dataset that tackles both double-blind and\nlogical coherence issues, demonstrating superior performance across multiple\nmetrics and achieving better alignment with real human dialogues.

    "abstract": "Forecasting violent rockbursts remains a formidable challenge due to\nsignificant uncertainties involved. One major uncertainty arises from the\nintermittency of rock failure processes, typically characterised by a series of\nprogressively shorter quiescent phases punctuated by sudden accelerations,\nrather than a smooth continuous progression towards the final breakdown. This\nnon-monotonic evolution of rock mass deformation complicates rockburst\nprediction, challenging conventional time-to-failure models that often assume a\nsmooth power law accelerating behaviour. Here, we introduce a generalised\ntime-to-failure model called log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) model\nto effectively capture the intermittent dynamics of damage and rupture\nprocesses in rock leading up to violent rockbursts. We perform parametric and\nnonparametric tests on 11 historical rockburst events at three underground\nmines, documenting empirical evidence and providing theoretical arguments to\ndemonstrate the significance of log-periodic oscillatory power law finite-time\nsingularities. Log-periodicity in these rockburst events is likely driven by\nthe interaction of subparallel propagating cracks, the diffusion of\nstress-triggering processes, or the interplay between stress drop and stress\ncorrosion. Our results and insights obtained have significant implications for\nnot only understanding but also forecasting rockbursts, as recognising and\ncharacterising log-periodicity can help transform intermittency from\ntraditionally perceived noise into valuable predictive information.",

The resulting normal forms provide an approximation to the\noriginal FPUT lattice that possesses a significant number of exact quadratic\nconservation laws, beyond the quadratic part of the Hamiltonian. We call the\nnew equations \"exact-resonance evolution equations\" and examine their\nproperties: (i) Heisenberg representation's slow evolution allows us to\nimplement numerical methods with large time steps to obtain relevant dynamical\ninformation, such as Lyapunov exponents. (ii) We introduce tests, such as\nconvergence of the normal form transformation and truncation error\nverification, to successfully validate our exact-resonance evolution equations.\n(iii) The systematic construction of new quadratic invariants (via the resonant\ncluster matrix) allows us to use finite-time Lyapunov exponent calculations to\nquantify the level of nonlinearity at which the original FPUT lattice is well\napproximated by the exact-resonance evolution equations. We show numerical\nexperiments in the case $N=9$, but the theory and numerical methods are valid\nfor arbitrary values of $N$. We conclude that, when $3$ divides $N$, at small\nenough nonlinearity the FPUT lattice's dynamics and nontrivial hyperchaos are\ngoverned by $5$-wave resonant interactions.",

Therefore, we propose MIGE, a unified framework that\nstandardizes task representations using multimodal instructions.

MIGE introduces a novel multimodal encoder that maps\nfree-form multimodal instructions into a unified vision-language space,\nintegrating visual and semantic features through a feature fusion\nmechanism.This unification enables joint training of both tasks, providing two\nkey advantages: (1) Cross-Task Enhancement: By leveraging shared visual and\nsemantic representations, joint training improves instruction adherence and\nvisual consistency in both subject-driven generation and instruction-based\nediting. (2) Generalization: Learning in a unified format facilitates\ncross-task knowledge transfer, enabling MIGE to generalize to novel\ncompositional tasks, including instruction-based subject-driven editing.\nExperiments show that MIGE excels in both subject-driven generation and\ninstruction-based editing while setting a state-of-the-art in the new task of\ninstruction-based subject-driven editing.

In both SCDT and\nCDWT configurations, the rotor is placed a distance behind the throat of the\nduct.

A key source of\nuncertainty arises from the sporadic nature of volcanic unrest, which is often\ncharacterised by intermittent phases of quiescent deceleration and sudden\nacceleration, rather than a consistent, predictable progression towards\neruption. This seemingly erratic pattern complicates volcano forecasting as it\nchallenges conventional time-to-failure models that often assume a simple\nsmooth power law acceleration. We propose a log-periodic power law singularity\nmodel, which effectively captures the intermittent and non-monotonic rupture\ndynamics characteristic of reawakening volcanoes at the site scale.\nMathematically, generalising the power law exponent by extending it from real\nto complex numbers, this model captures the partial break of continuous scale\ninvariance to discrete scale invariance that is inherent to the intermittent\ndynamics of damage and rupture processes in heterogeneous crustal systems. By\nperforming parametric and nonparametric tests on a large dataset of 34\nhistorical eruptions worldwide, we present empirical evidence and theoretical\narguments demonstrating the statistical significance of log-periodic\noscillations decorating power law finite-time singularities during pre-eruptive\nvolcanic unrest. Log-periodicity in volcanoes may originate from various\nmechanisms, including diffusion-dominated magma flow, magma-driven propagation\nof subparallel dykes, interaction between stress drop and stress corrosion,\nand/or interplay of inertia, damage, and healing within volcanic systems.

Among others, the scale of the random\ninitialization, the learning rate, and early stopping all have crucial impact\non the quality of the model learnt by stochastic gradient descent or related\nalgorithms. In order to understand these phenomena, we study the training\ndynamics of large two-layer neural networks. We use a well-established\ntechnique from non-equilibrium statistical physics (dynamical mean field\ntheory) to obtain an asymptotic high-dimensional characterization of this\ndynamics. This characterization applies to a Gaussian approximation of the\nhidden neurons non-linearity, and empirically captures well the behavior of\nactual neural network models.\n  Our analysis uncovers several interesting new phenomena in the training\ndynamics: $(i)$ The emergence of a slow time scale associated with the growth\nin Gaussian/Rademacher complexity; $(ii)$ As a consequence, algorithmic\ninductive bias towards small complexity, but only if the initialization has\nsmall enough complexity; $(iii)$ A separation of time scales between feature\nlearning and overfitting; $(iv)$ A non-monotone behavior of the test error and,\ncorrespondingly, a `feature unlearning' phase at large times.",

    "abstract": "Gene drive alleles bias their own inheritance to offspring. They can fix in a\nwild-type population in spite of a fitness cost, and even lead to the\neradication of the target population if the fitness cost is high. However, this\noutcome may be prevented or delayed if areas previously cleared by the drive\nare recolonised by wild-type individuals. Here, we investigate the conditions\nunder which these stochastic wild-type recolonisation events are likely and\nwhen they are unlikely to occur in one spatial dimension. More precisely, we\nexamine the conditions ensuring that the last individual carrying a wild-type\nallele is surrounded by a large enough number of drive homozygous individuals,\nresulting in a very low chance of wild-type recolonisation. To do so, we make a\ndeterministic approximation of the distribution of drive alleles within the\nwave, and we split the distribution of wild-type alleles into a deterministic\npart and a stochastic part. Our analytical and numerical results suggest that\nthe probability of wild-type recolonisation events increases with lower fitness\nof drive individuals, with smaller migration rate, and also with smaller local\ncarrying capacity. Numerical simulations show that these results extend to two\nspatial dimensions. We also demonstrate that, if a wild-type recolonisation\nevent were to occur, the probability of a following drive reinvasion event\ndecreases with smaller values of the intrinsic growth rate of the population.\nOverall, our study paves the way for further analysis of wild-type\nrecolonisation at the back of eradication traveling waves.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have created\nmodels capable of high-quality musical content generation. However, little\nconsideration is given to how to use these models for real-time or cooperative\njamming musical applications because of crucial required features: low latency,\nthe ability to communicate planned actions, and the ability to adapt to user\ninput in real-time. To support these needs, we introduce ReaLJam, an interface\nand protocol for live musical jamming sessions between a human and a\nTransformer-based AI agent trained with reinforcement learning. We enable\nreal-time interactions using the concept of anticipation, where the agent\ncontinually predicts how the performance will unfold and visually conveys its\nplan to the user. We conduct a user study where experienced musicians jam in\nreal-time with the agent through ReaLJam. Our results demonstrate that ReaLJam\nenables enjoyable and musically interesting sessions, and we uncover important\ntakeaways for future work.",
